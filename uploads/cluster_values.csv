1013,"Practice Level Costs of Office-Based Hypertension Performance Improvement: The Heart Healthy Lenoir Study EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Primary care practice leaders who consider engaging in quality improvement (QI) need to understand the practice level costs incurred when asking staff to take on new tasks. The Heart Healthy Lenoir study is a prospective cohort trial in which QI methods were used to enhance hypertension (HTN) care and reduce racial disparities in blood pressure control in small rural primary care practices in North Carolina. As part of this effort, we performed an activity-based costing analysis to describe the costs incurred to develop, implement, and maintain key tasks.We interviewed 20 practice stakeholders and phone-based health coaches during 2012-2014. We calculated the time invested by individuals to perform each task within each study phase and applied national hourly wages to generate cost estimates. Our descriptive analyses focus on four of the most widely used practices. Activities included time to abstract HTN control data, participate in project meetings, identify patients with uncontrolled HTN, create standardized work, and provide additional health coaching for patients with uncontrolled HTN. Despite practice and staffing differences, the developmental phase costs were similar, ranging from $879 to $1,417. Implementation costs varied more widely as practices took different approaches to identifying patients with uncontrolled HTN. Practice-specific phone health coaching costs ranged from $19,508 to more than $38,000. This study adds to the growing literature regarding practice level costs of engaging in systems change. Understanding these costs and balancing them against practice incentives may be helpful as stakeholders make decisions regarding HTN QI.",,,7,,,

1017,"Demographic and clinical factors associated with nonsurgical osteoarthritis treatment among patients in outpatient clinics OBJECTIVE: To identify patient demographic and clinical characteristics associated with osteoarthritis (OA) treatment use. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of 3 clinical trials among patients with hip or knee OA conducted in Duke Primary Care practices, the Durham Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System, and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC). At baseline, participants reported sociodemographic characteristics, OA-related pain and function, and OA treatment use, including oral analgesics, topical creams, joint injections, and physical therapy. Separate, multivariable logistic models (adjusted for clustering of clinics and providers for the Duke and VA cohorts) were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the associations between participant characteristics and each type of OA treatment. RESULTS: Oral analgesic use was reported by 70-82% of participants across the 3 cohorts. Physical therapy, knee injections, and topical creams were used by 39-52%, 55-60%, and 25-39% of Duke, VA, and UNC participants, respectively. In multivariable models, worse pain, stiffness, and function, per 5-unit increase, were associated with greater odds of using any oral analgesic for the cohorts from Duke (OR 1.18 [95% CI 1.08-1.28]) and UNC (OR 1.14 [95% CI 1.05-1.24]), but not for the VA cohort (OR 1.04 [95% CI 0.95-1.14]). For all 3 cohorts, nonwhites had higher odds of using topical creams compared to whites. CONCLUSION: Results suggest potential underutilization of therapies other than oral analgesics. Patient characteristics may affect OA treatment use, and understanding the relationship between these factors and OA treatment preferences may improve adherence to OA treatment guidelines. _ 2017, American College of Rheumatology.",,,9,,,

1019,"Sleep timing, stability, and BP in the sue_o_ancillary study of the hispanic community health study/study of latinos BACKGROUND: Timing and stability of the sleep-wake cycle are potential modifiable risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between objective measures of sleep-wake timing and stability with cardiometabolic disease risk. METHODS: In this multicenter, cross-sectional, population-based study, actigraphy data were obtained from the 2,156 adults, aged 18 to 64 years, recruited from the Sue_o ancillary study of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (2010-2013). These data were correlated with measures of cardiometabolic disease risk, including systolic and diastolic BPs, homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance, glycosylated hemoglobin, BMI, and hypertension and diabetes status. RESULTS: Each 10%_decrease in interdaily stability was associated with a 3.0%_absolute increase in the prevalence of hypertension (95%_CI, 0.6-5.3; P_< .05), an increase in systolic BP by 0.78_mm_Hg (95%_CI, 0.12-1.45; P_< .05) and an increase in diastolic BP by 0.80_mm_Hg (95%_CI, 0.28-1.32; P_< .05). In addition, delaying the midpoint of sleep by 1_h was associated with an increase in systolic BP by 0.73_mm_Hg (95%_CI, 0.30-1.16; P_< .01) and diastolic BP by 0.53_mm_Hg (95%_CI, 0.17-0.90; P_< .01). These associations were not significant after adjusting for shift work status. No association was found between interdaily stability or sleep timing and diabetes, BMI, or insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that beyond sleep duration, the timing and regularity of sleep-wake schedules are related to hypertension prevalence and BP.

1020,"Masked hypertension and incident clinic hypertension among blacks in the jackson heart study Masked hypertension, defined as nonelevated clinic blood pressure (BP) and elevated out-of-clinic BP may be an intermediary stage in the progression from normotension to hypertension. We examined the associations of out-of-clinic BP and masked hypertension using ambulatory BP monitoring with incident clinic hypertension in the Jackson Heart Study, a prospective cohort of blacks. Analyses included 317 participants with clinic BP < 140/90 mm__g, complete ambulatory BP monitoring, who were not taking antihypertensive medication at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Masked daytime hypertension was defined as mean daytime blood pressure _135/85 mm__g, masked night-time hypertension as mean night-time BP _120/70 mm__g, and masked 24-hour hypertension as mean 24-hour BP _130/80 mm__g. Incident clinic hypertension, assessed at study visits in 2005 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012, was defined as the first visit with clinic systolic/diastolic BP _140/90 mm__g or antihypertensive medication use. During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 187 (59.0%) incident cases of clinic hypertension. Clinic hypertension developed in 79.2% and 42.2% of participants with and without any masked hypertension, 85.7% and 50.4% with and without masked daytime hypertension, 79.9% and 43.7% with and without masked night-time hypertension, and 85.7% and 48.2% with and without masked 24-hour hypertension, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of incident clinic hypertension for any masked hypertension and masked daytime, night-time, and 24-hour hypertension were 2.13 (1.51-3.02), 1.79 (1.24-2.60), 2.22 (1.58-3.12), and 1.91 (1.32-2.75), respectively. These findings suggest that ambulatory BP monitoring can identify blacks at increased risk for developing clinic hypertension. _ 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,9,,,
1021,"Associations of blood pressure dipping patterns with left ventricular mass and left ventricular hypertrophy in blacks: the jackson heart study BACKGROUND: Abnormal diurnal blood pressure (BP), including nondipping patterns, assessed using ambulatory BP monitoring, have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk among white and Asian adults. We examined the associations of BP dipping patterns (dipping, nondipping, and reverse dipping) with cardiovascular target organ damage (left ventricular mass index and left ventricular hypertrophy), among participants from the Jackson Heart Study, an exclusively black population-based cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analyses included 1015 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring and had echocardiography data from the baseline visit. Participants were categorized based on the nighttime to daytime systolic BP ratio into 3 patterns: dipping pattern (_0.90), nondipping pattern (>0.90 to _1.00), and reverse dipping pattern (>1.00). The prevalence of dipping, nondipping, and reverse dipping patterns was 33.6%, 48.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. In a fully adjusted model, which included antihypertensive medication use and clinic and daytime systolic BP, the mean differences in left ventricular mass index between reverse dipping pattern versus dipping pattern was 8.3_2.1_g/m2 (P< 0.001) and between nondipping pattern versus dipping pattern was -1.0_1.6_g/m2 (P=0.536). Compared with participants with a dipping pattern, the prevalence ratio for having left ventricular hypertrophy was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.05-2.58) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.63-1.97) for those with a reverse dipping pattern and nondipping pattern, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of blacks, a reverse dipping pattern was associated with increased left ventricular mass index and a higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Identification of a reverse dipping pattern on ambulatory BP monitoring may help identify black at increased risk for cardiovascular target organ damage. _ 2017 The Authors.

1022,"Developmental trajectories of postpartum weight 3 years after birth: Norwegian Mother And Child Cohort study This study explored the developmental trajectories of postpartum weight from 0.5 to 3_years after childbirth, and aimed to determine the associations between postpartum weight trajectories and prepregnancy body mass index and adequacy of gestational weight gain (GWG). Data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study were used, following 49,528 mothers 0.5, 1.5, and 3_years after childbirth. Analyses were performed using latent growth mixture modeling. Three groups of developmental trajectories of postpartum weight were found, with most women (85.9_%) having a low level of weight retention initially and slight gain over 3_years, whereas 5.6_% of women started at a high postpartum weight retention (on average 7.56_kg) at 0.5_years but followed by a marked weight loss over time (2.63_kg per year on average), and the third trajectory represented women (8.5_%) who had high weight retention high initially (on average 4.67_kg at 0.5_years) and increasing weight over time (1.43_kg per year on average). Prepregnancy overweight and obesity and excessive GWG significantly predicted a high postpartum weight trend. Women had substantial variability in postpartum weight development-both initially after birth and in their weight trajectories over time. Early preventive interventions may be designed to assist women with prepregnancy overweight and obesity and excessive GWG, which helps to reduce the increasing trend for postpartum weight.",,,6,,,
1023,"Chitosan coagulation to improve microbial and turbidity removal by ceramic water filtration for household drinking water treatment The use of porous ceramic filters is promoted globally for household water treatment, but these filters are ineffective in removing viruses from water. In order to increase virus removal, we combine a promising natural coagulant, chitosan, as a pretreatment for ceramic water filters (CWFs) and evaluate the performance of this dual barrier water treatment system. Chitosan is a non-toxic and biodegradable organic polymer derived by simple chemical treatments from chitin, a major source of which is the leftover shells of crustacean seafoods, such as shrimp, prawns, crabs, and lobsters. To determine the effectiveness of chitosan, model test water was contaminated with Escherichia coli K011 and coliphage MS2 as a model enteric bacterium and virus, respectively. Kaolinite clay was used to model turbidity. Coagulation effectiveness of three types of modified chitosans was determine at various doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg/L, followed by flocculation and sedimentation. The pre-treated supernatant water was then decanted into the CWF for further treatment by filtration. There were appreciable microbial removals by chitosan HCl, acetate, and lactate pretreatment followed by CWF treatment, with mean reductions (95% CI) between 4.7 (_ 1.56) and 7.5 (_ 0.02) log10 for Escherichia coli, and between 2.8 (_ 0.10) and 4.5 (_ 1.04) log10 for MS2. Turbidity reduction with chitosan treatment and filtration consistently resulted in turbidities < 1 NTU, which meet turbidity standards of the US EPA and guidance by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO health-based microbial removal targets for household water treatment technology, chitosan coagulation achieved health protective targets for both viruses and bacteria. Therefore, the results of this study support the use of chitosan to improve household drinking water filtration processes by increasing virus and bacteria reductions.",,,5,,,
1024,"Mapping and characterization of structural variation in 17,795 human genomes A key goal of whole-genome sequencing for studies of human genetics is to interrogate all forms of variation, including single-nucleotide variants, small insertion or deletion (indel) variants and structural variants. However, tools and resources for the study of structural variants have lagged behind those for smaller variants. Here we used a scalable pipeline1 to map and characterize structural variants in 17,795 deeply sequenced human genomes. We publicly release site-frequency data to create the largest, to our knowledge, whole-genome-sequencing-based structural variant resource so far. On average, individuals carry 2.9 rare structural variants that alter coding regions; these variants affect the dosage or structure of 4.2 genes and account for 4.0-11.2% of rare high-impact coding alleles. Using a computational model, we estimate that structural variants account for 17.2% of rare alleles genome-wide, with predicted deleterious effects that are equivalent to loss-of-function coding alleles; approximately 90% of such structural variants are noncoding deletions (mean 19.1 per genome). We report 158,991 ultra-rare structural variants and show that 2% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale structural variants, nearly half of which are balanced or complex rearrangements. Finally, we infer the dosage sensitivity of genes and noncoding elements, and reveal trends that relate to element class and conservation. This work will help to guide the analysis and interpretation of structural variants in the era of whole-genome sequencing.",,,8,,,
1025,"Diversity in the US infectious diseases workforce: challenges for women and underrepresented minorities Research documents significant gender-based salary inequities among physicians and ongoing inadequacies in recruitment and promotion of physicians from underrepresented minority groups. Given the complexity of the social forces that promote these disparities, their elimination will likely require quantitative and qualitative research to understand the pathways that lead to them and to develop effective solutions. Interventions to combat implicit bias will be required, and structural interventions that hold medical school leadership accountable are needed to achieve and maintain salary equity and racial and gender diversity at all levels. _ The Author 2017.

1026,"A strategy to advance the evidence base in palliative medicine: formation of a palliative care research cooperative group BACKGROUND: Palliative medicine has made rapid progress in establishing its scientific and clinical legitimacy, yet the evidence base to support clinical practice remains deficient in both the quantity and quality of published studies. Historically, the conduct of research in palliative care populations has been impeded by multiple barriers including health care system fragmentation, small number and size of potential sites for recruitment, vulnerability of the population, perceptions of inappropriateness, ethical concerns, and gate-keeping. METHODS: A group of experienced investigators with backgrounds in palliative care research convened to consider developing a research cooperative group as a mechanism for generating high-quality evidence on prioritized, clinically relevant topics in palliative care. RESULTS: The resulting Palliative Care Research Cooperative (PCRC) agreed on a set of core principles: active, interdisciplinary membership; commitment to shared research purposes; heterogeneity of participating sites; development of research capacity in participating sites; standardization of methodologies, such as consenting and data collection/management; agile response to research requests from government, industry, and investigators; focus on translation; education and training of future palliative care researchers; actionable results that can inform clinical practice and policy. Consensus was achieved on a first collaborative study, a randomized clinical trial of statin discontinuation versus continuation in patients with a prognosis of less than 6 months who are taking statins for primary or secondary prevention. This article describes the formation of the PCRC, highlighting processes and decisions taken to optimize the cooperative group's success.",,,6,,,
1027,"Improving global health education: development of a Global Health Competency Model Although global health is a recommended content area for the future of education in public health, no standardized global health competency model existed for master-level public health students. Without such a competency model, academic institutions are challenged to ensure that students are able to demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) needed for successful performance in today's global health workforce. The Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) sought to address this need by facilitating the development of a global health competency model through a multistage modified-Delphi process. Practitioners and academic global health experts provided leadership and guidance throughout the competency development process. The resulting product, the Global Health Competency Model 1.1, includes seven domains and 36 competencies. The Global Health Competency Model 1.1 provides a platform for engaging educators, students, and global health employers in discussion of the KSAs needed to improve human health on a global scale.",,,2,,,
1028,"Hope matters: developing and validating a measure of future expectations among young women in a high HIV prevalence setting in rural south africa (HPTN 068) Hope is a future expectancy characterized by an individual's perception that a desirable future outcome can be achieved. Though scales exist to measure hope, they may have limited relevance in low resource, high HIV prevalence settings. We developed and validated a hope scale among young women living in rural South Africa. We conducted formative interviews to identify the key elements of hope. Using items developed from these interviews, we administered the hope scale to 2533 young women enrolled in an HIV-prevention trial. Women endorsed scale items highly and the scale proved to be unidimensional in the sample. Hope scores were significantly correlated with hypothesized psycholosocial correlates with the exception of life stressors. Overall, our hope measure was found to have excellent reliability and to show encouraging preliminary indications of validity in this population. This study presents a promising measure to assess hope among young women in South Africa.",,,6,,,
1029,"End-stage renal disease among HIV-infected adults in North America BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults, particularly those of black race, are at high-risk for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but contributing factors are evolving. We hypothesized that improvements in HIV treatment have led to declines in risk of ESRD, particularly among HIV-infected blacks. METHODS: Using data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration for Research and Design from January 2000 to December 2009, we validated 286 incident ESRD cases using abstracted medical evidence of dialysis (lasting >6 months) or renal transplant. A total of 38 354 HIV-infected adults aged 18-80 years contributed 159 825 person-years (PYs). Age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by race. Poisson regression was used to identify predictors of ESRD. RESULTS: HIV-infected ESRD cases were more likely to be of black race, have diabetes mellitus or hypertension, inject drugs, and/or have a prior AIDS-defining illness. The overall SIR was 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-3.6) but was significantly higher among black patients (4.5 [95% CI, 3.9-5.2]). ESRD incidence declined from 532 to 303 per 100 000 PYs and 138 to 34 per 100 000 PYs over the time period for blacks and nonblacks, respectively, coincident with notable increases in both the prevalence of viral suppression and the prevalence of ESRD risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hepatitis C virus coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of ESRD remains high among HIV-infected individuals in care but is declining with improvements in virologic suppression. HIV-infected black persons continue to comprise the majority of cases, as a result of higher viral loads, comorbidities, and genetic susceptibility. _ The Author 2014.

1031,"Extending social cognition models of health behaviour A cross-sectional study assessed the extent to which indices of social structure, including family socio-economic status (SES), social deprivation, gender and educational/lifestyle aspirations correlated with adolescent condom use and added to the predictive utility of a theory of planned behaviour model. Analyses of survey data from 824 sexually active 16-year-olds (505 women and 319 men) tested three hypotheses. Firstly, social structure measures will correlate with behaviour-specific cognitions that predict condom use. Secondly, cognition measures will not fully mediate the effects of social structural indices and thirdly, the effects of cognitions on condom use will be moderated by social structure indices. All three hypotheses were supported. SES, gender and aspirations accounted for between 2 and 7% of the variance in behaviour-specific cognitions predicting condom use. Aspirations explained a further 4% of the variance in condom use, controlling for cognition effects. Mother's SES and gender added an additional 5%, controlling for aspirations. Overall, including significant moderation effects, of social structure indices increased the variance explained from 20.5% (for cognition measures alone) to 31%. These data indicate that social structure measures should to be investigated in addition to cognitions when modelling antecedents of behaviour, including condom use.",,,2,,,
1032,"The replication-competent HIV-1 latent reservoir is primarily established near the time of therapy initiation Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective at suppressing HIV-1 replication, the virus persists as a latent reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells during therapy. This reservoir forms even when ART is initiated early after infection, but the dynamics of its formation are largely unknown. The viral reservoirs of individuals who initiate ART during chronic infection are generally larger and genetically more diverse than those of individuals who initiate therapy during acute infection, consistent with the hypothesis that the reservoir is formed continuously throughout untreated infection. To determine when viruses enter the latent reservoir, we compared sequences of replication-competent viruses from resting peripheral CD4+ T cells from nine HIV-positive women on therapy to viral sequences circulating in blood collected longitudinally before therapy. We found that, on average, 71% of the unique viruses induced from the post-therapy latent reservoir were most genetically similar to viruses replicating just before ART initiation. This proportion is far greater than would be expected if the reservoir formed continuously and was always long lived. We conclude that ART alters the host environment in a way that allows the formation or stabilization of most of the long-lived latent HIV-1 reservoir, which points to new strategies targeted at limiting the formation of the reservoir around the time of therapy initiation.

1033,"Patterns and trends in the intake distribution of manufactured and homemade sugar-sweetened beverages in pre-tax Mexico, 1999-2012 OBJECTIVE: To describe trends across the intake distribution of total, manufactured and homemade sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) from 1999 to 2012, focusing on high SSB consumers and on changes by socio-economic status (SES) subgroup. DESIGN: We analysed data from one 24 h dietary recall from two nationally representative surveys. Quantile regression models at the 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles of energy intake distribution of SSB were used. SETTING: 1999 Mexican National Nutrition Survey and 2012 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey.ParticipantsSchool-aged children (5-11 years) and women (20-49 years) for trend analyses (n 7718). Population aged >1 year for 2012 (n 10 096). RESULTS: Over the 1999-2012 period, there were significant increases in the proportion of total and manufactured SSB consumers (5_7 and 10_7 percentage points), along with an increase in per-consumer SSB energy intake, resulting in significant increases in per-capita total SSB energy intake (142, 247 and 397 kJ/d (34, 59 and 95 kcal/d) in school-aged children and 155, 331 and 456 kJ/d (37, 79 and 109 kcal/d) in women at the 50th, 75th and 90th percentile, respectively). Total and manufactured SSB intakes increased sharply among low-SES children but remained similar among high-SES children during this time span. CONCLUSIONS: Large increases in SSB consumption were seen between 1999 and 2012 during this pre-tax SSB period, particularly for the highest consumers. Trends observed in school-aged children are a clear example of the nutrition transition experienced in Mexico. Policies to discourage high intake of manufactured SSB should continue, joined with strategies to encourage water and low-calorie beverage consumption.",,,4,,,
1034,"Healthcare Access and Quality Index based on mortality from causes amenable to personal health care in 195 countries and territories, 1990_2015: a novel analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 BACKGROUND: National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. METHODS: We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r=0_88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0_83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r=0_77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28_6 to 94_6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40_7 (95% uncertainty interval, 39_0-42_8) in 1990 to 53_7 (52_2-55_4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21_2 in 1990 to 20_1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73_8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015. INTERPRETATION: This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improveme t across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system characteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.

Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016. METHODS: Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0-100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita. FINDINGS: In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97_1 (95% UI 95_8-98_1) in Iceland, followed by 96_6 (94_9-97_9) in Norway and 96_1 (94_5-97_3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18_6 (13_1-24_4) in the Central African Republic, 19_0 (14_3-23_7) in Somalia, and 23_4 (20_2-26_8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91_5 (89_1-93_6) in Beijing to 48_0 (43_4-53_2) in Tibet (a 43_5-point difference), while India saw a 30_8-point disparity, from 64_8 (59_6-68_8) in Goa to 34_0 (30_3-38_1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4_8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20_9-point to 17_0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17_2-point to 20_4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum sa substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries. INTERPRETATION: GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view-and subsequent provision-of quality health care for all populations.

1036,"Impact evaluation of the Urban Health Initiative in urban Uttar Pradesh, India OBJECTIVES: The Urban Health Initiative (UHI) was initiated in 2009 with the goal of increasing family planning (FP) use among the poor in urban areas of Uttar Pradesh, India. The Measurement, Learning & Evaluation project (MLE) was tasked with rigorous impact evaluation of the UHI. This paper presents the impact evaluation findings of the UHI program. STUDY DESIGN: The MLE design includes a longitudinal sample of women and health facilities with baseline (2010) and endline (2014) data collection in six cities in Uttar Pradesh, India. At baseline, samples representative of women in each city were selected with oversampling of the poor. Eighty-four percent of women interviewed at baseline were reinterviewed 4 years later at endline. The longitudinal data support a within/fixed-effects approach to identification of program impact on changes in modern FP use. RESULTS: Impact evaluation results show significant effects of exposure to both demand and supply side program activities. In particular, women exposed to brochures (marginal effect: 6.96, p< .001), billboards/posters/wall hangings (marginal effect: 2.09, p< .05), and FP on the television (marginal effect: 2.46, p< .001) were significantly more likely to be using a modern method at endline. In addition, we found borderline significance for being exposed to a community health worker (marginal effect: 1.66, p< .10) and living close to an improved public and private supply environment where UHI undertook activities (marginal effects and p values: 2.48, p< .05 and 1.56, p< .10, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: UHI program activities were designed to complement the Government of India's strategies aimed at ensuring access to and provision of FP to urban poor populations. The effective demand- and supply-side strategies of the UHI program are therefore likely to be sustainable and scalable to other urban areas in India. IMPLICATIONS STATEMENT: Findings from this study are important for designing sustainable and scalable FP strategies for urban India where increases in FP use will be relevant for meeting international FP targets.

1037,"Reducing the density and number of tobacco retailers: policy solutions and legal issues INTRODUCTION: Because higher density of tobacco retailers is associated with greater tobacco use, U.S. communities seek ways to reduce the density and number of tobacco retailers. This approach can reduce the concentration of tobacco retailers in poorer communities, limit youth exposure to tobacco advertising, and prevent misleading associations between tobacco and health messaging. METHODS: Communities can reduce the density and number of tobacco retailers by imposing minimum distance requirements between existing retailers, capping the number of retailers in a given geographic area, establishing a maximum number of retailers proportional to population size, and prohibiting sales at certain types of establishments, such as pharmacies, or within a certain distance of locations serving youth. Local governments use direct regulation, licensing, or zoning laws to enact these changes. We analyze each approach under U.S. constitutional law to assist communities in selecting and implementing one or more of these methods. There are few published legal opinions that address these strategies in the context of tobacco control. But potential constitutional challenges include violations of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which protects property owners from onerous government regulations, and under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, which protect business owners from arbitrary or unreasonable regulations that do not further a legitimate government interest. CONCLUSION: Because there is an evidentiary basis linking the density of tobacco retailers to smoking rates in a community, courts are likely to reject constitutional challenges to carefully crafted laws that reduce the number of tobacco retailers. IMPLICATIONS: Our review of the relevant constitutional issues confirms that local governments have the authority to utilize laws and policies to reduce the density and number of tobacco retailers in their communities, given existing public health data. The analysis guides policy makers in crafting laws that comply with constitutional requirements by outlining the most important procedures and evidentiary justifications to use in development, implementation, and enforcement. This perspective also highlights the importance of reviewing state constitutions, statutes, and municipal codes and getting local input from attorneys and community stakeholders to assess the likely success of some methods over others. _ The Author 2016.

1039,"Long-term consequences of nutrition and growth in early childhood and possible preventive interventions Maternal nutritional deficiencies and excesses during pregnancy, and faster infant weight gain in the first 2 years of life are associated with increased risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. The first 1,000 days of life (from conception until the child reaches age 2 years) represent a vulnerable period for programming of NCD risk, and are an important target for prevention of adult disease. This paper takes a developmental perspective to identify periconception, pregnancy, and infancy nutritional stressors, and to discuss mechanisms through which they influence later disease risk with the goal of informing age-specific interventions. Low- and middle-income countries need to address the dual burden of under- and overnutrition by implementing interventions to promote growth and enhance survival and intellectual development without increasing chronic disease risk. In the absence of good evidence from long-term follow-up of early life interventions, current recommendations for early life prevention of adult disease presume that interventions designed to optimize pregnancy outcomes and promote healthy infant growth and development will also reduce chronic disease risk. These include an emphasis on optimizing maternal nutrition prior to pregnancy, micronutrient adequacy in the preconception period and during pregnancy, promotion of breastfeeding and high-quality complementary foods, and prevention of obesity in childhood and adolescence. _ 2014 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

1040,"How Overweight and Obesity Relate to the Development of Functional Limitations among Filipino Women As life expectancy and obesity increase in low and middle-income countries, the relationship of weight status to functional outcomes in older adults in these settings requires attention. We examined how overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2), obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2), and high waist circumference (WC > 80 cm) related to grip strength, timed up-and-go, and development of limitations in mobility, activities of daily living (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among Filipino women. We analyzed data from seven rounds of the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (1994, n = 2279 to 2015, n = 1568, age 49-78 years) to examine how women's reports of functional limitations related to their prior WC, and how their grip strength and timed up-and-go related to concurrently measured overweight and obesity, adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, and urbanicity. High WC was associated with higher odds of subsequent mobility and IADL limitations. Chronic disease morbidity (sum of self-reported arthritis, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer) fully mediated the association of high WC with ADL and IADL limitations, but not physical/mobility limitations. Longer up-and-go times, and higher grip strength were related to overweight and obesity. Results emphasize the need for obesity prevention to reduce chronic diseases and maintain good functional status as women age.",,,2,,,
1041,"Associations of linear growth and relative weight gain during early life with adult health and human capital in countries of low and middle income: findings from five birth cohort studies BACKGROUND: Fast weight gain and linear growth in children in low-income and middle-income countries are associated with enhanced survival and improved cognitive development, but might increase risk of obesity and related adult cardiometabolic diseases. We investigated how linear growth and relative weight gain during infancy and childhood are related to health and human capital outcomes in young adults. METHODS: We used data from five prospective birth cohort studies from Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa. We investigated body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma glucose concentration, height, years of attained schooling, and related categorical indicators of adverse outcomes in young adults. With linear and logistic regression models, we assessed how these outcomes relate to birthweight and to statistically independent measures representing linear growth and weight gain independent of linear growth (relative weight gain) in three age periods: 0-2 years, 2 years to mid-childhood, and mid-childhood to adulthood. FINDINGS: We obtained data for 8362 participants who had at least one adult outcome of interest. A higher birthweight was consistently associated with an adult body-mass index of greater than 25 kg/m(2) (odds ratio 1_28, 95% CI 1_21-1_35) and a reduced likelihood of short adult stature (0_49, 0_44-0_54) and of not completing secondary school (0_82, 0_78-0_87). Faster linear growth was strongly associated with a reduced risk of short adult stature (age 2 years: 0_23, 0_20-0_52; mid-childhood: 0_39, 0_36-0_43) and of not completing secondary school (age 2 years: 0_74, 0_67-0_78; mid-childhood: 0_87, 0_83-0_92), but did raise the likelihood of overweight (age 2 years: 1_24, 1_17-1_31; mid-childhood: 1_12, 1_06-1_18) and elevated blood pressure (age 2 years: 1_12, 1_06-1_19; mid-childhood: 1_07, 1_01-1_13). Faster relative weight gain was associated with an increased risk of adult overweight (age 2 years: 1_51, 1_43-1_60; mid-childhood: 1_76, 1_69-1_91) and elevated blood pressure (age 2 years: 1_07, 1_01-1_13; mid-childhood: 1_22, 1_15-1_30). Linear growth and relative weight gain were not associated with dysglycaemia, but a higher birthweight was associated with decreased risk of the disorder (0_89, 0_81-0_98). INTERPRETATION: Interventions in countries of low and middle income to increase birthweight and linear growth during the first 2 years of life are likely to result in substantial gains in height and schooling and give some protection from adult chronic disease risk factors, with few adverse trade-offs.

1042,"The emergence of cardiometabolic disease risk in Chinese children and adults: consequences of changes in diet, physical activity and obesity Strong secular declines in physical activity, increased fat and salt intake, and increased obesity, especially abdominal obesity, mark China's recent nutrition transition. The China Health and Nutrition 2009 Survey collected anthropometry, blood pressure and fasting blood samples from more than 9,000 individuals _ 7 years of age. We focus on elevated blood pressure and plasma markers of diabetes, inflammation and dyslipidemia. We used international definitions of cardiometabolic risk and estimated age- and sex-specific prevalence ratios for each outcome for high waist circumference or overweight. We used logistic regression to assess each risk factor's association with diet, physical activity, overweight and abdominal obesity. Cardiometabolic risk prevalence was high in all age groups Prevalence ratios for most risk factors were nearly doubled for overweight or high waist circumference groups. Prevalence ratios were higher in younger than older adults. Low physical activity consistently predicted higher cardiometabolic risk across most outcomes and age-sex groups. The co-occurrence of overweight and high waist circumference was highly predictive of dyslipidemia, elevated glycated haemoglobin and diabetes. High prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and their strong association with weight status and abdominal obesity in young adults portend increases in cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality. Early interventions will be required to reverse trends. _ 2014 The Authors.

1043,"20-year trends in Filipino women's weight reflect substantial secular and age effects Increasing obesity in low- and middle-income countries is well documented in cross-sectional studies. However, few longitudinal studies identify factors that influence individual weight gain patterns over time in relation to the major social and economic changes that now characterize these settings. This study uses data from adult Filipino women participating in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey from 1983 to 2005. A sample of 3005 women contributed 1-8 observations each. Longitudinal mixed effects models identified how age and secular weight trends related to underlying effects of urbanization and changing household socioeconomic status (SES) and to proximate individual effects of reproductive history, diet, and occupational physical activity. The 23-y secular trend in weight amounted to nearly 10 kg. Younger women gained more weight than older women (12.4 kg in those < 20 y old in 1983 vs. 4.9 kg in those > 35 y). Periods of more rapid weight gain corresponded to periods of rapid increase in SES and urbanization. Weight was positively related to energy intake, percentage of calories from protein, and more sedentary occupations, but negatively related to months pregnant and lactating and postmenopausal status. These effects all varied with age and over time. The trends contributed to a 6-fold increase in prevalence of overweight and an increasing number of women who have or are likely to develop obesity-related metabolic diseases. The trends are highly relevant for health policy and preventive health measures in the Philippines and other countries now facing the dual burden of over- and undernutrition.",,,6,,,
1044,"Seventeen-Year Changes in Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference, Elevated Blood Pressure, and Diabetes Phenotypes in a Cohort of Filipino Women Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have risen dramatically in Asia, but few cohort studies track age and secular trends in these conditions. We use Cebu (The Philippines) Longitudinal Health and Nutrition survey data to document 1998 to 2015 prevalence and co-occurrence of body mass index (BMI; >25 kg/m2), high waist circumference (WC; >80 cm), elevated blood pressure (EBP; systolic _130 or diastolic _85 mm Hg), and type 2 diabetes among ~2000 women aged 29 to 62 years in 1998; and identify their relationship to community, household, and individual factors using longitudinal logistic regression. Prevalence (1998-2015) rates were 35% to 49%, BMI >25 kg/m2; 32% to 58% high WC; 21% to 59% EBP; and 2% to 14% diabetes. Only 20% of women had none of these conditions in 2015. Diabetes was strongly driven by age and secular trends in high WC related to higher socioeconomic status and urbanization. Hypertension increased with age in lower socioeconomic status rural and more affluent urban women. Results underscore the continuing need for public health measures to prevent obesity and to identify and treat hypertension and diabetes.",,,4,,,

1046,"Factor Analysis of the CES-D 12 among a Community Sample of Black Men The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale is one of the most widely used measures for assessing depression in population-based research. Little is known about the varying range of symptomatology expressed by Black men, who report higher chronicity and disability of their depressive symptoms compared to men of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. This study assessed the dimensional structure of the CES-D 12-item scale using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in a community-based sample of Black men ( n = 683). Two latent factors emerged from the scale that best fit the data: interpersonal negative affect (INA) and diminished positive affect (DPA). The item ""I felt like everything I did was an effort"" was removed from the final measure, resulting in an 11-item scale. The total score for the revised CES-D-11 displayed acceptable internal consistency on both latent factors (Cronbach's _ = 0.83 [INA] and 0.73 [DPA]) and model fit (_2 = 165.58, TLI = 0.967, CFI = 0.974, RMSEA = 0.065). Results differ from CES-D factor analyses in other demographic groups, including studies with other male subpopulations, such that depressed mood and interpersonal problems factors are merged as a unidimensional construct. Findings suggest that the ""effort"" item from the CES-D 12 should be interpreted with caution among Black men. Future studies should continue to disentangle the divergent pathways in which Black men express depressed mood.",,,1,,,
1047,"Health outcomes of gastric bypass patients compared to nonsurgical, nonintervened severely obese Favorable health outcomes at 2 years postbariatric surgery have been reported. With exception of the Swedish Obesity Subjects (SOS) study, these studies have been surgical case series, comparison of surgery types, or surgery patients compared to subjects enrolled in planned nonsurgical intervention. This study measured gastric bypass effectiveness when compared to two separate severely obese groups not participating in designed weight-loss intervention. Three groups of severely obese subjects (N = 1,156, BMI >or= 35 kg/m(2)) were studied: gastric bypass subjects (n = 420), subjects seeking gastric bypass but did not have surgery (n = 415), and population-based subjects not seeking surgery (n = 321). Participants were studied at baseline and 2 years. Quantitative outcome measures as well as prevalence, incidence, and resolution rates of categorical health outcome variables were determined. All quantitative variables (BMI, blood pressure, lipids, diabetes-related variables, resting metabolic rate (RMR), sleep apnea, and health-related quality of life) improved significantly in the gastric bypass group compared with each comparative group (all P < 0.0001, except for diastolic blood pressure and the short form (SF-36) health survey mental component score at P < 0.01). Diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension resolved much more frequently in the gastric bypass group than in the comparative groups (all P < 0.001). In the surgical group, beneficial changes of almost all quantitative variables correlated significantly with the decrease in BMI. We conclude that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery when compared to severely obese groups not enrolled in planned weight-loss intervention was highly effective for weight loss, improved health-related quality of life, and resolution of major obesity-associated complications measured at 2 years.",,,1,,,
1048,"Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.",,,5,,,
1049,"Association of delays in surgery for melanoma with insurance type Importance: Timely receipt of treatment for cancer is an important aspect of health care quality. It is unknown how delays of surgery for melanoma vary by insurance type. Objective: To analyze factors associated with delays between diagnosis and surgery for melanoma in patients with Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of patients who received a diagnosis of melanoma between 2004 and 2011 in North Carolina using data from the North Carolina Cancer Registry linked to administrative claims from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. Inclusion criteria were incident patients with a diagnosis of melanoma stage 0 to III and with continuous insurance enrollment from at least 1 month prior to the month of diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis of melanoma. Main Outcomes and Measures: Surgical delay, defined as definitive surgical excision occurring more than 6 weeks after melanoma diagnosis. Generalized linear models with log link, Poisson distributions, and robust standard errors were used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RRs) to model risk of delay in definitive surgery. Results: A total of 7629 patients were included (4210 [55%] female; mean [SD] age, 64 [15] years), 48% (n_=_3631) Medicare, 48% (n_=_3667) privately insured, and 4% (n_=_331) Medicaid patients. Privately insured patients were least likely to experience a delay in definitive surgery, followed by Medicare and Medicaid patients (519 [14%], 609 [17%], and 79 [24%], respectively; P_< _.001). After demographic adjustment, the risk of surgical delay was significantly increased in patients with Medicaid compared with private insurance (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09-1.70). Delays were more likely in nonwhite patients (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.87). Surgical delays were less likely if the physician performing the surgery (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.93) or the diagnosing clinician (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.93) was a dermatologist as compared with a nondermatologist. Conclusion and Relevance: Surgical treatment delays were common but were less prevalent in patients diagnosed or surgically treated by a dermatologist. Medicaid patients experienced the most surgical delays. A reduction in delays in melanoma surgery could be achieved through better access to specialty care and cross-disciplinary coordination.",,,5,,,
1050,"Intakes of Calcium and Phosphorus and Calculated Calcium-to-Phosphorus Ratios of Older Adults: NHANES 2005-2006 Data BACKGROUND: High intakes of dietary phosphorus (P), relative to calcium (Ca) intake, are associated with a lower calcium:phosphorus ratio (Ca:P) ratio which potentially has adverse health effects, including arterial calcification, bone loss, and death. A substantial percentage of older adults (50 to 70 and 71 plus years) who have a higher risk of fracture rate than younger adults typically have low intakes of dietary Ca that are dominated by higher intakes of dietary P from natural and fortified foods, and lower Ca:P ratios than desirable. OBJECTIVE: This investigation was undertaken to examine Ca and P intakes and the resulting Ca:P ratios (by mass) across gender and older adult age groups, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006. DESIGN: NHANES data are based on a cross-sectional sample of the non-institutionalized United States (US) population within various regions. This sample is selected to be representative of the entire US population at all ages. National Cancer Institute (NCI) methods and SAS survey procedures were used for analyses. Ca:P ratios were calculated using total Ca from both foods and supplements, whereas P intakes were calculated from food composition values and supplements. The amounts of P additives in processed foods are not available. RESULTS: Mean Ca and P intakes demonstrated lower intakes of Ca and higher intakes of P compared to current Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). The Ca:P ratios in older male and female adults were influenced by both low-Ca and high-P dietary consumption patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Both low total Ca intakes and high P amounts contribute to lower Ca:P ratios, i.e., ~0.7:1.0, in the consumption patterns of older adults than is recommended by the RDAs, i.e., ~1.5:1.0. Whether Ca:P ratios lower than recommended contribute to increased risk of bone loss, arterial calcification, and all-cause mortality cannot be inferred from these data. Additional amounts of chemical P additives in the food supply may actually reduce even further the Ca:P ratios of older adults of both genders, but, without P additive data from the food industry, calculation of more precise ratios from NHANES 2005-2006 data is not possible.",,,4,,,
1051,"The interplay of type 1 diabetes and weight management: A qualitative study exploring thematic progression from adolescence to young adulthood BACKGROUND: The impact of weight management in persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from childhood into adulthood has not been well described. The purpose of the study was to explore qualitative themes presented by young adults with T1D with respect to the dual management of weight and T1D. METHODS: We analyzed focus group data from 17 young adults with T1D (65% female, age 21.7___2.1__ears, HbA1c 8.1%___1.5) via inductive qualitative analysis methods. Major themes were compared to themes presented by youth with T1D ages 13-16__ears in previously published study in order to categorize thematic progression from early adolescence through adulthood. RESULTS: Themes from young adults with T1D, when compared to those from youth were categorized as: (a) persistent and unchanged themes, (b) evolving themes, and (c) newly reported themes. Hypoglycemia and a sense of futility around exercise was an unchanged theme. Importance of insulin usage and a healthy relationship with T1D evolved to gather greater conviction. Newly reported themes are unique to integration of adulthood into T1D, such as family planning and managing T1D with work obligations. Young adults also reported negative experiences with providers in their younger years and desire for more supportive provider relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Issues identified by youth regarding the dual management of T1D and weight rarely resolve, but rather, persist or evolve to integrate other aspects of young adulthood. Individualized and age-appropriate clinical support and practice guidelines are warranted to facilitate the dual management of weight and T1D in persons with T1D. _ 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1052,"Parental childhood growth and offspring birthweight: pooled analyses from four birth cohorts in low and middle income countries OBJECTIVE: Associations between parental and offspring size at birth are well established, but the relative importance of parental growth at different ages as predictors of offspring birthweight is less certain. Here we model parental birthweight and postnatal conditional growth in specific age periods as predictors of offspring birthweight. METHODS: We analyzed data from 3,392 adults participating in four prospective birth cohorts and 5,506 of their offspring. RESULTS: There was no significant heterogeneity by study site or offspring sex. 1SD increase in maternal birthweight was associated with offspring birthweight increases of 102 g, 1SD in maternal length growth 0-2 year with 46 g, and 1SD in maternal height growth Mid-childhood (MC)-adulthood with 27 g. Maternal relative weight measures were associated with 24 g offspring birth weight increases (2 year- MC) and 49 g for MC-adulthood period but not with earlier relative weight 0-2 year. For fathers, birthweight, and linear/length growth from 0-2 year were associated with increases of 57 and 56 g in offspring birthweight, respectively but not thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and paternal birthweight and growth from birth to 2 year each predict offspring birthweight. Maternal growth from MC-adulthood, relative weight from 2-MC and MC-adulthood also predict offspring birthweight. These findings suggest that shared genes and/or adequate nutrition during early life for both parents may confer benefits to the next generation, and highlight the importance of maternal height and weight prior to conception.

These metals often occur as mixtures in the environment, creating the potential for interactive or synergistic biological effects different from those observed in single exposure conditions. In the present study, environmental mixtures collected from two waste sites in China and comparable mixtures prepared in the laboratory were tested for toxicogenomic response in placental JEG-3 cells. These cells serve as a model for evaluating cellular responses to exposures during pregnancy. One of the mixtures was predominated by iAs and one by Cd. Six gene biomarkers were measured in order to evaluate the effects from the metal mixtures using dose and time-course experiments including: heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and metallothionein isoforms (MT1A, MT1F and MT1G) previously shown to be preferentially induced by exposure to either iAs or Cd, and metal transporter genes aquaporin-9 (AQP9) and ATPase, Cu(2+) transporting, beta polypeptide (ATP7B). There was a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of ATP7B, HO-1, MT1A, MT1F, and MT1G in mixture-treated cells compared to the iAs or Cd only-treated cells. Notably, the genomic responses were observed at concentrations significantly lower than levels found at the environmental collection sites. These data demonstrate that metal mixtures increase the expression of gene biomarkers in placental JEG-3 cells in a synergistic manner. Taken together, the data suggest that toxic metals that co-occur may induce detrimental health effects that are currently underestimated when analyzed as single metals. Copyright _ 2015.

1054,"Early-life soy exposure and gender-role play behavior in children BACKGROUND: Soy-based infant formula contains high levels of isoflavones. These estrogen-like compounds have been shown to induce changes in sexually dimorphic behaviors in animals exposed in early development. OBJECTIVE: We examined gender-role play behavior in relation to soy-based and non-soy-based infant feeding methods among children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. METHODS: We studied 3,664 boys and 3,412 girls. Four exposure categories were created using data from questionnaires administered at 6 and 15 months postpartum: primarily breast, early formula (referent), early soy, and late soy. Gender-role play behavior was assessed using the Pre-School Activities Inventory (PSAI). Associations between infant feeding and PSAI scores at 42 months of age were assessed using linear regression. Post hoc analyses of PSAI scores at 30 and 57 months were also conducted. RESULTS: Early-infancy soy use was reported for approximately 2% of participants. Mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] PSAI scores at 42 months were 62.3 (62.0, 62.6) and 36.9 (36.6, 37.2) for boys and girls, respectively. After adjustment, early soy (vs. early formula) feeding was associated with higher (less feminine) PSAI scores in girls (_ = 2.66; 95% CI: 0.19, 5.12) but was not significantly associated with PSAI scores in boys. The association between soy exposure and PSAI scores in girls was substantially attenuated at 30 and 57 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although not consistent throughout childhood, early-life soy exposure was associated with less female-typical play behavior in girls at 42 months of age. Soy exposure was not significantly associated with play behavior in boys.",,,9,,,
1055,"Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11_791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.",,,5,,,

1058,"Structural interventions for HIV prevention in the United States BACKGROUND: Structural interventions change the environment in which people act to influence their health behaviors. Most structural interventions research for HIV infection has focused on developing countries, with the United States receiving substantially less attention. This article identifies some social determinants of HIV vulnerability in the United States and structural interventions to address them. METHODS: Review of the medical, public health, and social science literature. RESULTS: Evidence supports widespread implementation of a number of structural interventions in the United States clearly proximate to HIV, including comprehensive sex education, universal condom availability, expanded syringe access for drug users, health care coverage, and stable housing. Sociological plausibility supports evaluation and implementation of other interventions that target social determinants more distal but of relevance to HIV, such as initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in criminal sentencing, to promote early childhood education and to decrease poverty. CONCLUSIONS: Structural interventions that address social determinants of HIV infection may be among the most cost effective methods of preventing HIV infection in the United States over the long term.",,,5,,,
1059,"US black women and human immunodeficiency virus prevention: time for new approaches to clinical trials Black women bear the highest burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among US women. Tenofovir/emtricitabine HIV prevention trials among women in Africa have yielded varying results. Ideally, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among US women would provide data for guidelines for US women's HIV preexposure prophylaxis use. However, even among US black women at high risk for HIV infection, sample size requirements for an RCT with HIV incidence as its outcome are prohibitively high. We propose to circumvent this large sample size requirement by evaluating relationships between HIV incidence and drug concentrations measured among participants in traditional phase 3 trials in high-incidence settings and then applying these observations to drug concentrations measured among at-risk individuals in lower-incidence settings, such as US black women. This strategy could strengthen the evidence base to enable black women to fully benefit from prevention research advances and decrease racial disparities in HIV rates. _ The Author 2017.

1064,"Changing attitudes about concurrency among young african americans: results of a radio campaign We created and evaluated an 8-month campaign of provocative radio ads to change attitudes about concurrent (overlapping) sexual partnerships among young African Americans. We created a concurrency attitude scale and compared its score distributions in independent samples of African Americans, ages 18-34 years, interviewed by telephone before (n = 678) and after (n = 479) the campaign. Pre- and post-campaign samples reflected similar response rates (pre: 32.6%; post: 31.8%) and distributions of personal characteristics. Reported exposure to concurrency messages was greater after the campaign (pre: 6.3%, post: 30.9%), and mean scores indicated less acceptance of concurrency (pre: 3.40 [95% CI 3.23, 3.57]; post: 2.62 [2.46, 2.78]). Score differences were not a function of differences in composition of the samples (adjusted means: pre: 3.37 [3.21, 3.53]; post: 2.62 [2.47, 2.76]). Findings demonstrate that a carefully targeted, intensive mass media campaign can change attitudes about concurrency, which should facilitate behavior change.",,,6,,,
1065,"Concurrent partnerships, nonmonogamous partners, and substance use among women in the United States OBJECTIVES: We determined the prevalence, distribution, and correlates of US women's involvement in concurrent sexual partnerships, a sexual-network pattern that speeds population-wide HIV dissemination. METHODS: We used sexual partnership dates reported by 7643 women in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth to determine prevalence of concurrent sexual partnerships during the preceding 12 months. We examined associations between concurrency and sociodemographic characteristics and risk behaviors. RESULTS: Prevalence of concurrent partnerships was 5.7% based on reported partnerships and 8.3% after adjustment for possible underreporting. Concurrency was associated with younger age (22 to 24 years: prevalence odds ratio [POR] = 2.44) versus older age (40 to 44 years); marital status (formerly married: POR = 6.56; never married: POR = 3.81; vs married); Black race/ethnicity (POR = 1.78); younger age at first sexual intercourse (12 to 13 years: POR = 2.89) versus 18 years or older); having a nonmonogamous sexual partner (POR = 6.96); having intercourse while ""high"" on drugs or alcohol (POR = 1.61); binge drinking (POR = 1.70); and crack or cocaine use (POR = 2.72). CONCLUSIONS: The association of concurrency with nonmonogamous sexual partners and substance use suggests the existence of extensive sexual networks that link people at higher risk for HIV infection with increased opportunities for disseminating infection.",,,3,,,
1066,"Sex ratio, poverty, and concurrent partnerships among men and women in the United States: a multilevel analysis PURPOSE: Social and economic contextual factors may promote concurrent sexual partnerships, which can accelerate population HIV transmission and are more common among African Americans than U.S. Whites. We investigated the relationship between contextual factors and concurrency. METHODS: We analyzed past 12-month concurrency prevalence in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth and its contextual database in relation to county sex ratio (among respondent's racial and ethnic group), percentage in poverty (among respondent's racial and ethnic group), and violent crime rate. Analyses examined counties with balanced (0.95-1.05 males/female) or low (< 0.9) sex ratios. RESULTS: Concurrency prevalence was greater (odds ratio [OR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) in counties with low sex ratios (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.17-2.39), more poverty (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.98-1.42 per 10 percentage-point increase), and higher crime rates (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.09 per 1000 population/year). Notably, 99.5% of Whites and 93.7% of Hispanics, but only 7.85% of Blacks, lived in balanced sex ratio counties; about 5% of Whites, half of Hispanics, and three-fourths of Blacks resided in counties with >20% same-race poverty. CONCLUSIONS: The dramatic Black-White differences in contextual factors in the United States and their association with sexual concurrency could contribute to the nation's profound racial disparities in HIV infection.

1067,"Association of the PHACTR1/EDN1 genetic locus with spontaneous coronary artery dissection BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) afflicting predominantly younger to middle-aged women. Observational studies have reported a high prevalence of extracoronary vascular anomalies, especially fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and a low prevalence of coincidental cases of atherosclerosis. PHACTR1/EDN1 is a genetic risk locus for several vascular diseases, including FMD and coronary artery disease, with the putative causal noncoding variant at the rs9349379 locus acting as a potential enhancer for the endothelin-1 (EDN1) gene. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to test the association between the rs9349379 genotype and SCAD. METHODS: Results from case control studies from France, United Kingdom, United States, and Australia were analyzed to test the association with SCAD risk, including age at first event, pregnancy-associated SCAD (P-SCAD), and recurrent SCAD. RESULTS: The previously reported risk allele for FMD (rs9349379-A) was associated with a higher risk of SCAD in all studies. In a meta-analysis of 1,055 SCAD patients and 7,190 controls, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.86) per copy of rs9349379-A. In a subset of 491 SCAD patients, the OR estimate was found to be higher for the association with SCAD in patients without FMD (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.53 to 2.33) than in SCAD cases with FMD (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.99). There was no effect of genotype on age at first event, P-SCAD, or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The first genetic risk factor for SCAD was identified in the largest study conducted to date for this_condition. This genetic link may contribute to the clinical overlap between SCAD and FMD. Copyright _ 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,

1069,"Breakfast Dietary Patterns among Mexican Children Are Related to Total-Day Diet Quality Background: Mexico has experienced shifts in food availability and consumption patterns over the past few decades from traditional diets to those containing more high-energy density foods, resulting in the development of unhealthful dietary patterns among children and adults. However, to our knowledge it is not known whether breakfast consumption patterns contribute to the overall daily diet of Mexican children.Objective: We examined total-day diet among breakfast consumers compared with breakfast skippers, identified and investigated breakfast dietary patterns in relation to energy and nutrient intakes at breakfast and across the day, and examined these patterns in relation to sociodemographic characteristics.Methods: With the use of nationally representative dietary data (one 24-h recall) from the 2012 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey, 3760 children aged 4-13 y were categorized into mutually exclusive breakfast patterns with the use of cluster analysis. The association between breakfast patterns and breakfast skippers with dietary intake at breakfast and for the total day was investigated with the use of multivariate linear regression.Results: Most children (83%) consumed breakfast. Six breakfast dietary patterns were identified (milk and sweetened breads, tortillas and beans, sweetened beverages, sandwiches and quesadillas, eggs, and cereal and milk) and reflected both traditional and more Westernized dietary patterns. Sugar-sweetened beverages were consumed across all patterns. Compared with all breakfast dietary patterns, breakfast skippers had the lowest intake of several nutrients of public health concern. Nutrients to limit that were high at breakfast tended to be high for the total day and vice versa for nutrients to encourage.Conclusions: There was not a single pattern that complied perfectly with the Mexican School Breakfast Guidelines, but changes such as increasing dietary fiber by encouraging more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans and reducing sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages could support compliance with these targets and improve overall diet quality. _ 2017 American Society for Nutrition.",,,4,,,

1072,"Are community health workers effective in retaining women in the maternity care continuum? Evidence from India Objectives: Despite the recognised importance of adopting a continuum of care perspective in addressing the care of mothers and newborns, evidence on specific interventions to enhance engagement of women along the maternity care continuum has been limited. We use the example of the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) programme in India, to understand the role of community health workers in retaining women in the maternity care continuum. Methods: Using the Indian Human Development Survey data from 2011 to 2012, we assess the association between individual and cluster-level exposure to ASHA and four key components along the continuum of care-at least one antenatal care (ANC) visit, four or more ANC visits, presence of a skilled birth attendance (SBA) at the time of birth and postnatal care for the mother or child within 48__ours of birth, for 13_705 women with a live birth since 2005. To understand which of these services experience maximum dropout along the continuum, we use a linear probability model to calculate the weighted percentages of using each service. We assess the association between exposure to ASHA and number of services utilised using a multinomial logistic regression model adjusted for a range of confounding variables and survey weights. Results: Our study indicates that exposure to the ASHA is associated with an increased probability of women receiving at least one ANC and SBA. In terms of numbers of services, exposure to ASHA accounts for a 12% (95% CI: 9.1 to 15.1) increase in women receiving at least some of the services, and an 8.8% (95% CI: -10.2 to -7.4) decrease in women receiving no services. However, exposure to ASHA does not increase the likelihood of women utilising all the services along the continuum. Conclusions: While ASHA is effective in supporting women to initiate and continue care along the continuum, it does not significantly affect the completion of all services along the continuum.",,,6,,,
1073,"The impact of India's accredited social health activist (ASHA) program on the utilization of maternity services: a nationally representative longitudinal modelling study BACKGROUND: In 2006, the Government of India launched the accredited social health activist (ASHA) program, with the goal to connect marginalized communities to the health care system. We assessed the effect of the ASHA program on the utilization of maternity services. METHODS: We used data from Indian Human Development Surveys done in 2004-2005 and in 2011-2012 to assess demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with the receipt of ASHA services, and used difference-in-difference analysis with cluster-level fixed effects to assess the effect of the program on the utilization of at least one antenatal care (ANC) visit, four or more ANC visits, skilled birth attendance (SBA), and giving birth at a health facility. RESULTS: Substantial variations in the receipt of ASHA services were reported with 66% of women in northeastern states, 30% in high-focus states, and 16% of women in other states. In areas where active ASHA activity was reported, the poorest women, and women belonging to scheduled castes and other backward castes, had the highest odds of receiving ASHA services. Exposure to ASHA services was associated with a 17% (95% CI 11.8-22.1) increase in ANC-1, 5% increase in four or more ANC visits (95% CI_-_1.6-11.1), 26% increase in SBA (95% CI 20-31.1), and 28% increase (95% CI 22.4-32.8) in facility births. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ASHA program is successfully connecting marginalized communities to maternity health services. Given the potential of the ASHA in impacting service utilization, we emphasize the need to strengthen strategies to recruit, train, incentivize, and retain ASHAs.",,,2,,,
1074,"Orthostatic change in blood pressure and incidence of atrial fibrillation: results from a bi-ethnic population based study BACKGROUND: Autonomic fluctuations are associated with the initiation and possibly maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, little is known about the relationship between orthostatic blood pressure change, a common manifestation of autonomic dysfunction, and incident AF. METHODS: We examined whether supine-to-standing changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) are associated with incident AF in 12,071 African American and white men and women aged 45-64 years, enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities (ARIC) study. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined as a supine-standing drop in SBP by _20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure by _10 mmHg. AF cases were identified based on study scheduled 12-lead ECG, hospital discharge ICD codes, and death certificates through 2009. RESULTS: OH was seen in 603 (5%) at baseline. During an average follow-up of 18.1 years, 1438 (11.9%) study participants developed AF. Incident AF occurred more commonly among those with OH than those without, a rate of 9.3 vs. 6.3 per 1000 person years, (p< 0.001). The age, gender, and race adjusted hazard ratio (95%CI) of AF among those with OH compared to those without was 1.62 (1.34, 2.14). This association was attenuated after adjustment for common AF risk factors to HR 1.40 (1.15, 1.71), a strength similar to that of diabetes or hypertension with AF in the same model. A non-linear relationship between orthostatic change in SBP and incident AF was present after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: OH is associated with higher AF incidence. Whether interventions that decrease OH can reduce AF risk remains unknown.",,,9,,,
1075,"Prediction of incident heart failure in general practice: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study BACKGROUND: A simple and effective heart failure (HF) risk score would facilitate the primary prevention and early diagnosis of HF in general practice. We examined the external validity of existing HF risk scores, optimized a 10-year HF risk function, and examined the incremental value of several biomarkers, including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. METHODS AND RESULTS: During 15.5 years (210 102 person-years of follow-up), 1487 HF events were recorded among 13 555 members of the biethnic Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort. The area under curve from the Framingham-published, Framingham-recalibrated, Health ABC HF recalibrated, and ARIC risk scores were 0.610, 0.762, 0.783, and 0.797, respectively. On addition of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, the optimism-corrected area under curve of the ARIC HF risk score increased from 0.773 (95% CI, 0.753-0.787) to 0.805 (95% CI, 0.792-0.820). Inclusion of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide improved the overall classification of recalibrated Framingham, recalibrated Health ABC, and ARIC risk scores by 18%, 12%, and 13%, respectively. In contrast, cystatin C or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein did not add toward incremental risk prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The ARIC HF risk score is more parsimonious yet performs slightly better than the extant risk scores in predicting 10-year risk of incident HF. The inclusion of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide markedly improves HF risk prediction. A simplified risk score restricted to a patient's age, race, sex, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide performs comparably to the full score (area under curve, 0.745) and is suitable for automated reporting from laboratory panels and electronic medical records.",,,1,,,
1076,"Airflow obstruction, lung function, and risk of incident heart failure: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study AIMS: We examined the relationship between forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), airflow obstruction, and incident heart failure (HF) in black and white, middle-aged men and women in four US communities. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lung volumes by standardized spirometry and information on covariates were collected on 15 792 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort participants in 1987-89. Incident HF was ascertained from hospital records and death certificates up to 2005 in 13 660 eligible participants. Over an average follow-up of 14.9 years, 1369 (10%) participants developed new-onset HF. The age- and height-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for HF increased monotonically over descending quartiles of FEV(1) for both genders, race groups, and smoking status. After multivariable adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and height, the HRs [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of HF comparing the lowest with the highest quartile of FEV(1) were 3.91 (2.40-6.35) for white women, 3.03 (2.12-4.33) for white men, 2.11 (1.33-3.34) for black women, and 2.23 (1.37-3.59) for black men. The association weakened but remained statistically significant after additional adjustment for systemic markers of inflammation. The multivariable adjusted incidence of HF was higher in those with FEV(1)/forced vital capacity < 70% vs. _70%: HR 1.44 (95% CI 1.20-1.74) among men and 1.40 (1.13-1.72) among women. A consistent and positive association with HF was seen for self-reported diagnosis of emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but not for asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based cohort with long-term follow-up, low FEV(1) and an obstructive respiratory disease were strongly and independently associated with the risk of incident HF.",,,9,,,
1077,"Relation of ventricular premature complexes to heart failure (from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities [ARIC] Study) Analogous to rapid ventricular pacing, frequent ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) can predispose over time to cardiomyopathy and subsequent heart failure (HF). We examined the association of frequent VPCs with HF incidence in a population-based cohort, free of HF and coronary heart disease at baseline. At study baseline (1987 to 1989), _1 VPC on a 2-minute rhythm electrocardiographic strip was seen in 5.5% (739 of 13,486) of the middle-age (45 to 64 years old at baseline) white and black, men and women of the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities cohort. Incident HF was defined as the first appearance of International Classification of Diseases code 428.x in the hospital discharge record or death certificate through 2005. During an average follow-up of 15.6 years, incident HF was seen in 10% the participants (19.4% of those with VPCs vs 9.4% of those without). The age-, race-, and gender-adjusted hazard ratio of HF for VPCs was 1.89 (95% confidence interval 1.59 to 2.24). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio of HF for those with any VPC versus no VPC was 1.63 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.96). After additional adjustment for incident coronary heart disease as a time-varying covariate, the hazard ratio was 1.71 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 2.08). Those with a greater frequency of VPCs or complex VPCs had similar rates of HF compared to those with a single VPC and all had rates greater than those with no VPC. In conclusion, in this large population-based cohort, the presence of VPCs was associated with incident HF, independent of incident coronary heart disease. Copyright _ 2012 Elsevier Inc.

1078,"The association of lipoprotein(a) with incident heart failure hospitalization: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a proatherogenic lipoprotein associated with coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and more recently aortic stenosis and heart failure (HF). We examined the association of Lp(a) levels with incident HF hospitalization in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We also assessed the relationship between Lp(a) levels and arterial stiffness as a potential mechanism for development of HF. METHODS: Lp(a) was measured in 14,154 ARIC participants without prevalent HF at ARIC visit 1 (1987-1989). The association of Lp(a) quintiles with incident HF hospitalization was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Arterial stiffness parameters were stratified based on Lp(a) quintiles, and p-trend was calculated across ordered groups. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 23.4 years, there were 2605 incident HF hospitalizations. Lp(a) levels were directly associated with incident HF hospitalization in models adjusted for age, race, gender, systolic blood pressure, history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body mass index, heart rate, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.41; p-trend across increasing quintiles < 0.01), but not after excluding prevalent and incident myocardial infarction cases (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91-1.27; p-trend_=_0.70). When adjusted for age, gender, and race, Lp(a) quintiles were not significantly associated with arterial stiffness parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Increased Lp(a) levels were associated with increased risk of incident HF hospitalization. After excluding prevalent and incident myocardial infarction, the association was no longer significant. Lp(a) levels were not associated with arterial stiffness parameters.

We examined blood DNA methylation in relation to incident CHD across multiple prospective cohorts. METHODS: Nine population-based cohorts from the United States and Europe profiled epigenome-wide blood leukocyte DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium 450k microarray, and prospectively ascertained CHD events including coronary insufficiency/unstable angina, recognized myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and coronary death. Cohorts conducted race-specific analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, body mass index, blood cell type proportions, and technical variables. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses across cohorts. RESULTS: Among 11_461 individuals (mean age 64 years, 67% women, 35% African American) free of CHD at baseline, 1895 developed CHD during a mean follow-up of 11.2 years. Methylation levels at 52 CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites were associated with incident CHD or myocardial infarction (false discovery rate< 0.05). These CpGs map to genes with key roles in calcium regulation (ATP2B2, CASR, GUCA1B, HPCAL1), and genes identified in genome- and epigenome-wide studies of serum calcium (CASR), serum calcium-related risk of CHD (CASR), coronary artery calcified plaque (PTPRN2), and kidney function (CDH23, HPCAL1), among others. Mendelian randomization analyses supported a causal effect of DNA methylation on incident CHD; these CpGs map to active regulatory regions proximal to long non-coding RNA transcripts. CONCLUSION: Methylation of blood-derived DNA is associated with risk of future CHD across diverse populations and may serve as an informative tool for gaining further insight on the development of CHD.",,,8,,,
1080,"Protocols, Methods, and Tools for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of Dental Traits Oral health and disease are known to be influenced by complex interactions between environmental (e.g., social and behavioral) factors and innate susceptibility. Although the exact contribution of genomics and other layers of ""omics"" to oral health is an area of active research, it is well established that the susceptibility to dental caries, periodontal disease, and other oral and craniofacial traits is substantially influenced by the human genome. A comprehensive understanding of these genomic factors is necessary for the realization of precision medicine in the oral health domain. To aid in this direction, the advent and increasing affordability of high-throughput genotyping has enabled the simultaneous interrogation of millions of genetic polymorphisms for association with oral and craniofacial traits. Specifically, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of dental caries and periodontal disease have provided initial insights into novel loci and biological processes plausibly implicated in these two common, complex, biofilm-mediated diseases. This paper presents a summary of protocols, methods, tools, and pipelines for the conduct of GWAS of dental caries, periodontal disease, and related traits. The protocol begins with the consideration of different traits for both diseases and outlines procedures for genotyping, quality control, adjustment for population stratification, heritability and association analyses, annotation, reporting, and interpretation. Methods and tools available for GWAS are being constantly updated and improved; with this in mind, the presented approaches have been successfully applied in numerous GWAS and meta-analyses among tens of thousands of individuals, including dental traits such as dental caries and periodontal disease. As such, they can serve as a guide or template for future genomic investigations of these and other traits.",,,8,,,
1081,"Development of a broadly accessible venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle vaccine platform Zoonotic viruses circulate as swarms in animal reservoirs and can emerge into human populations, causing epidemics that adversely affect public health. Portable, safe, and effective vaccine platforms are needed in the context of these outbreak and emergence situations. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of an alphavirus replicon vaccine platform based on a non-select agent, attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus vaccine, strain 3526 (VRP 3526). Using both noroviruses and coronaviruses as model systems, we demonstrate the utility of the VRP 3526 platform in the generation of recombinant proteins, production of virus-like particles, and in vivo efficacy as a vaccine against emergent viruses. Importantly, packaging under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions distinguishes VRP 3526 from previously reported alphavirus platforms and makes this approach accessible to the majority of laboratories around the world. In addition, improved outcomes in the vulnerable aged models as well as against heterologous challenge suggest improved efficacy compared to that of previously attenuated VRP approaches. Taking these results together, the VRP 3526 platform represents a safe and highly portable system that can be rapidly deployed under BSL2 conditions for generation of candidate vaccines against emerging microbial pathogens.IMPORTANCE While VEE virus replicon particles provide a robust, established platform for antigen expression and vaccination, its utility has been limited by the requirement for high-containment-level facilities for production and packaging. In this work, we utilize an attenuated vaccine strain capable of use at lower biocontainment level but retaining the capacity of the wild-type replicon particle. Importantly, the new replicon platform provides equal protection for aged mice and following heterologous challenge, which distinguishes it from other attenuated replicon platforms. Together, the new system represents a highly portable, safe system for use in the context of disease emergence. Copyright _ 2018 Agnihothram et al.",,,0,,,
1082,"A mouse model for Betacoronavirus subgroup 2c using a bat coronavirus strain HKU5 variant Cross-species transmission of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) can result in pandemic disease outbreaks. Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, has caused 182 cases to date, with ~43% mortality, and no small animal model has been reported. MERS-CoV and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus (_-CoV) subgroup 2c share >65% identity at the amino acid level in several regions, including nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are significant drug and vaccine targets. BtCoV HKU5 has been described in silico but has not been shown to replicate in culture, thus hampering drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2c _-CoVs. We report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of BtCoV HKU5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE). This virus replicates efficiently in cell culture and in young and aged mice, where the virus targets airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Unlike some subgroup 2b SARS-CoV vaccines that elicit a strong eosinophilia following challenge, we demonstrate that BtCoV HKU5 and MERS-CoV N-expressing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines do not cause extensive eosinophilia following BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge. Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE in young mice resulted in enhanced virulence, causing 20% weight loss, diffuse alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane formation in aged mice. Passaged virus was characterized by mutations in the nsp13, nsp14, open reading frame 5 (ORF5) and M genes. Finally, we identified an inhibitor active against the nsp5 proteases of subgroup 2c _-CoVs. Synthetic-genome platforms capable of reconstituting emerging zoonotic viral pathogens or their phylogenetic relatives provide new strategies for identifying broad-based therapeutics, evaluating vaccine outcomes, and studying viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The 2012 outbreak of MERS-CoV raises the specter of another global epidemic, similar to the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. MERS-CoV is related to BtCoV HKU5 in target regions that are essential for drug and vaccine testing. Because no small animal model exists to evaluate MERS-CoV pathogenesis or to test vaccines, we constructed a recombinant BtCoV HKU5 that expressed a region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein, thereby allowing the recombinant virus to grow in cell culture and in mice. We show that this recombinant virus targets airway epithelial cells and causes disease in aged mice. We use this platform to (i) identify a broad-spectrum antiviral that can potentially inhibit viruses closely related to MERS-CoV, (ii) demonstrate the absence of increased eosinophilic immune pathology for MERS-CoV N protein-based vaccines, and (iii) mouse adapt this virus to identify viral genetic determinants of cross-species transmission and virulence. This study holds significance as a strategy to control newly emerging viruses.",,,1,,,
1083,"Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50 The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group _-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2_amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV in vitro and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.

1084,"Small-Molecule Antiviral _-d-N4-Hydroxycytidine Inhibits a Proofreading-Intact Coronavirus with a High Genetic Barrier to Resistance Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged from animal reservoirs to cause severe and lethal disease in humans, but there are currently no FDA-approved antivirals to treat the infections. One class of antiviral compounds, nucleoside analogues, mimics naturally occurring nucleosides to inhibit viral replication. While these compounds have been successful therapeutics for several viral infections, mutagenic nucleoside analogues, such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil, have been ineffective at inhibiting CoVs. This has been attributed to the proofreading activity of the viral 3'-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). _-d-N4-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) (EIDD-1931; Emory Institute for Drug Development) has recently been reported to inhibit multiple viruses. Here, we demonstrate that NHC inhibits both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.17___) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (EC50 = 0.56___) with minimal cytotoxicity. NHC inhibited MHV lacking ExoN proofreading activity similarly to wild-type (WT) MHV, suggesting an ability to evade or overcome ExoN activity. NHC inhibited MHV only when added early during infection, decreased viral specific infectivity, and increased the number and proportion of G:A and C:U transition mutations present after a single infection. Low-level NHC resistance was difficult to achieve and was associated with multiple transition mutations across the genome in both MHV and MERS-CoV. These results point to a virus-mutagenic mechanism of NHC inhibition in CoVs and indicate a high genetic barrier to NHC resistance. Together, the data support further development of NHC for treatment of CoVs and suggest a novel mechanism of NHC interaction with the CoV replication complex that may shed light on critical aspects of replication.IMPORTANCE The emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) into human populations from animal reservoirs has demonstrated their epidemic capability, pandemic potential, and ability to cause severe disease. However, no antivirals have been approved to treat these infections. Here, we demonstrate the potent antiviral activity of a broad-spectrum ribonucleoside analogue, _-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), against two divergent CoVs. Viral proofreading activity does not markedly impact sensitivity to NHC inhibition, suggesting a novel interaction between a nucleoside analogue inhibitor and the CoV replicase. Further, passage in the presence of NHC generates only low-level resistance, likely due to the accumulation of multiple potentially deleterious transition mutations. Together, these data support a mutagenic mechanism of inhibition by NHC and further support the development of NHC for treatment of CoV infections.

1085,"Gender-based power and couples' HIV risk in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, north India CONTEXT: Gender inequality is a long-recognized driver of the HIV epidemic. However, few studies have investigated the association between gender-based power and HIV risk in India, which has the world's third largest HIV epidemic. METHODS: Population-based data collected in 2003 from 3,385 couples residing in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, North India, were used to examine associations between gender-based power (wife's autonomy and husband's inequitable gender attitudes) and indicators of couples' HIV risk (whether the husband had had premarital sex with someone other than his eventual spouse, extramarital sex in the past year or STI symptoms in the past year). Structural equation modeling was used to create composite variables for the gender-based power measures and test their associations with HIV risk measures. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of husbands had had premarital sex, 7% had had extramarital sex in the past year and 6% had had STI symptoms in the past year. Structural equation models indicated that wives who reported higher levels of autonomy were less likely than other wives to have husbands who had had extramarital sex in the past year (direct association) or STI symptoms in the past year (indirect association). Moreover, husbands who endorsed more inequitable gender attitudes were more likely than others to report having had premarital sex with someone other than their spouse, which in turn was associated with having had extramarital sex and STI symptoms in the past year. CONCLUSIONS: If the associations identified in this study reflect a causal relationship between gender-based power and HIV risk behavior, then HIV prevention programs that successfully address inequitable gender roles may reduce HIV risks in North India.",,,6,,,
1086,"Measuring alcohol consumption for genomic meta-analyses of alcohol intake: opportunities and challenges Whereas moderate drinking may have health benefits, excessive alcohol consumption causes many important acute and chronic diseases and is the third leading contributor to preventable death in the United States. Twin studies suggest that alcohol-consumption patterns are heritable (50%); however, multiple genetic variants of modest effect size are likely to contribute to this heritable variation. Genome-wide association studies provide a tool for discovering genetic loci that contribute to variations in alcohol consumption. Opportunities exist to identify susceptibility loci with modest effect by meta-analyzing together multiple studies. However, existing studies assessed many different aspects of alcohol use, such as typical compared with heavy drinking, and these different assessments can be difficult to reconcile. In addition, many studies lack the ability to distinguish between lifetime and recent abstention or to assess the pattern of drinking during the week, and a variety of such concerns surround the appropriateness of developing a common summary measure of alcohol intake. Combining such measures of alcohol intake can cause heterogeneity and exposure misclassification, cause a reduction in power, and affect the magnitude of genetic association signals. In this review, we discuss the challenges associated with harmonizing alcohol-consumption data from studies with widely different assessment instruments, with a particular focus on large-scale genetic studies.",,,1,,,
1087,"Predicting and defining steroid resistance in pediatric nephrotic syndrome using plasma proteomics Introduction: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a characterized by massive proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and dyslipidemia. Glucocorticoids (GCs), the primary therapy for >60 years, are ineffective in approximately 50% of adults and approximately 20% of children. Unfortunately, there are no validated biomarkers able to predict steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) or to define the pathways regulating SRNS. Methods: We performed proteomic analyses on paired pediatric NS patient plasma samples obtained both at disease presentation before glucocorticoid initiation and after approximately 7 weeks of GC therapy to identify candidate biomarkers able to either predict steroid resistance before treatment or define critical molecular pathways/targets regulating steroid resistance. Results: Proteomic analyses of 15 paired NS patient samples identified 215 prevalent proteins, including 13 candidate biomarkers that predicted SRNS before GC treatment, and 66 candidate biomarkers that mechanistically differentiated steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) from SRNS. Ingenuity Pathway Analyses and protein networking pathways approaches further identified proteins and pathways associated with SRNS. Validation using 37 NS patient samples (24 SSNS/13 SRNS) confirmed vitamin D binding protein (VDB) and APOL1 as strong predictive candidate biomarkers for SRNS, and VDB, hemopexin (HPX), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and APOL1 as strong candidate biomarkers to mechanistically distinguish SRNS from SSNS. Logistic regression analysis identified a candidate biomarker panel (VDB, ADIPOQ, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 [MMP-2]) with significant ability to predict SRNS at disease presentation (P_= 0.003; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve_= 0.78). Conclusion: Plasma proteomic analyses and immunoblotting of serial samples in childhood NS identified a candidate biomarker panel able to predict SRNS at disease presentation, as well as candidate molecular targets/pathways associated with clinical steroid resistance. _ 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

1088,"Towards a unified taxonomy of health indicators: academic health centers and communities working together to improve population health The Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program represents a significant public investment. To realize its major goal of improving the public's health and reducing health disparities, the CTSA Consortium's Community Engagement Key Function Committee has undertaken the challenge of developing a taxonomy of community health indicators. The objective is to initiate a unified approach for monitoring progress in improving population health outcomes. Such outcomes include, importantly, the interests and priorities of community stakeholders, plus the multiple, overlapping interests of universities and of the public health and health care professions involved in the development and use of local health care indicators.The emerging taxonomy of community health indicators that the authors propose supports alignment of CTSA activities and facilitates comparative effectiveness research across CTSAs, thereby improving the health of communities and reducing health disparities. The proposed taxonomy starts at the broadest level, determinants of health; subsequently moves to more finite categories of community health indicators; and, finally, addresses specific quantifiable measures. To illustrate the taxonomy's application, the authors have synthesized 21 health indicator projects from the literature and categorized them into international, national, or local/special jurisdictions. They furthered categorized the projects within the taxonomy by ranking indicators with the greatest representation among projects and by ranking the frequency of specific measures. They intend for the taxonomy to provide common metrics for measuring changes to population health and, thus, extend the utility of the CTSA Community Engagement Logic Model. The input of community partners will ultimately improve population health.",,,1,,,
1089,"High-resolution mapping of a complex disease, a model for rheumatoid arthritis, using heterogeneous stock mice Resolving the genetic basis of complex diseases like rheumatoid arthritis will require knowledge of the corresponding diseases in experimental animals to enable translational functional studies. Mapping of quantitative trait loci in mouse models of arthritis, such as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), using F(2) crosses has been successful, but can resolve loci only to large chromosomal regions. Using an inbred-outbred cross design, we identified and fine-mapped CIA loci on a genome-wide scale. Heterogeneous stock mice were first intercrossed with an inbred strain, B10.Q, to introduce an arthritis permitting MHCII haplotype. Homozygous H2(q) mice were then selected to set up an F(3) generation with fixed major histocompatibility complex that was used for arthritis experiments. We identified 26 loci, 18 of which are novel, controlling arthritis traits such as incidence of disease, severity and time of onset and fine-mapped a number of previously mapped loci.",,,8,,,
1090,"End-of-Life Care Planning in Accountable Care Organizations: Associations with Organizational Characteristics and Capabilities OBJECTIVE: To measure the extent to which accountable care organizations (ACOs) have adopted end-of-life (EOL) care planning processes and characterize those ACOs that have established processes related to EOL. DATA SOURCES: This study uses data from three waves (2012-2015) of the National Survey of ACOs. Respondents were 397 ACOs participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial ACO contracts. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional survey study using multivariate ordered logit regression models. We measured the extent to which the ACO had adopted EOL care planning processes as well as organizational characteristics, including care management, utilization management, health informatics, and shared decision-making capabilities, palliative care, and patient-centered medical home experience. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-one percent of ACOs had few or no EOL care planning processes, 60 percent had some processes, and 19.6 percent had advanced processes. ACOs with a hospital in their system (OR: 3.07; p_=_.01), and ACOs with advanced care management (OR: 1.43; p_=_.02), utilization management (OR: 1.58, p_=_.00), and shared decision-making capabilities (OR: 16.3, p_=_.000) were more likely to have EOL care planning processes than those with no hospital or few to no capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: There remains considerable room for today's ACOs to increase uptake of EOL care planning, possibly by leveraging existing care management, utilization management, and shared decision-making processes. _ Health Research and Educational Trust.",,,2,,,
1091,"Hunting, Sale, and Consumption of Bushmeat Killed by Lead-Based Ammunition in Benin Human consumption of animal meat killed by lead ammunition has been reported as a risk factor for elevated blood lead levels. However, little is known about how meat killed by lead ammunition is hunted, prepared, sold, and consumed. We explored the process from hunting to consumption within communities in Benin from the perspective of preventive measures. We conducted 38 semi-structured interviews with hunters (n = 9) and sellers (n = 8) of bushmeat and families (n = 21) as consumers of bushmeat killed by lead ammunition. Data were transcribed, translated, and coded for analysis. We conducted content analysis to identify and describe key themes and processes from hunting to consumption. Many hunters (n = 7/9) used lead-based ammunition. After the meat is hunted, market sellers often buy it directly from the hunters. Amongst the hunters and sellers, few (n = 4/17) acknowledged removing the meat impacted by lead shot prior to sale. Many families (n = 15/21) mentioned consumption of the hunted bushmeat. The meat is cooked before sharing with children. Many families (n = 19/21) mentioned they look for the remains of the lead shot or remove the meat impacted by the shot. The finding suggests that hunting, sale, and consumption of bushmeat killed by lead ammunition are well-known practices in Allada, Benin. The bushmeat often hunted illegally with lead shot is sold in the markets and eventually consumed by families who attempt to clean the meat impacted by the lead shot before cooking it.",,,4,,,
1092,"The use of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) within comparative effectiveness research: implications for clinical practice and health care policy BACKGROUND: The goal of comparative effectiveness research (CER) is to explain the differential benefits and harms of alternate methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care. To inform decision making, information from the patient's perspective that reflects outcomes that patients care about are needed and can be collected rigorously using appropriate patient-reported outcomes (PRO). It can be challenging to select the most appropriate PRO measure given the proliferation of such questionnaires over the past 20 years. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we discuss the value of PROs within CER, types of measures that are likely to be useful in the CER context, PRO instrument selection, and key challenges associated with using PROs in CER. METHODS: We delineate important considerations for defining the CER context, selecting the appropriate measures, and for the analysis and interpretation of PRO data. Emerging changes that may facilitate CER using PROs as an outcome are also reviewed including implementation of electronic and personal health records, hospital and population-based registries, and the use of PROs in national monitoring initiatives. The potential benefits of linking the information derived from PRO endpoints in CER to decision making is also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations presented for incorporating PROs in CER are intended to provide a guide to researchers, clinicians, and policy makers to ensure that information derived from PROs is applicable and interpretable for a given CER context. In turn, CER will provide information that is necessary for clinicians, patients, and families to make informed care decisions.",,,5,,,
1093,"Index case finding facilitates identification and linkage to care of children and young persons living with HIV/AIDS in Malawi OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of a novel index case finding and linkage-to-care programme to identify and link HIV-infected children (1-15 years) and young persons (>15-24 years) to care. METHODS: HIV-infected patients enrolled in HIV services were screened and those who reported untested household members (index cases) were offered home- or facility-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC) of their household by a community health worker (CHW). HIV-infected household members identified were enrolled in a follow-up programme offering home and facility-based follow-up by CHWs. RESULTS: Of the 1567 patients enrolled in HIV services, 1030 (65.7%) were screened and 461 (44.8%) identified as index cases; 93.5% consented to HIV testing of their households and of those, 279 (64.7%) reported an untested child or young person. CHWs tested 711 children and young persons, newly diagnosed 28 HIV-infected persons (yield 4.0%; 95% CI: 2.7-5.6), and identified an additional two HIV-infected persons not enrolled in care. Of the 30 HIV-infected persons identified, 23 (76.6%) were linked to HIV services; 18 of the 20 eligible for ART (90.0%) were initiated. Median time (IQR) from identification to enrolment into HIV services was 4 days (1-8) and from identification to ART start was 6 days (1-8). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of HIV-infected patients enrolled in treatment services had untested household members, many of whom were children and young persons. Index case finding, coupled with home-based testing and tracked follow-up, is acceptable, feasible and facilitates the identification and timely linkage to care of HIV-infected children and young persons. _ 2017 The Authors.

1094,"Report of the Office of Population Affairs' expert work group meeting on short birth spacing and adverse pregnancy outcomes: Methodological quality of existing studies and future directions for research BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that women wait at least 24 months after a livebirth before attempting a subsequent pregnancy to reduce the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, and infant health outcomes. However, the applicability of the WHO recommendations for women in the United States is unclear, as breast feeding, nutrition, maternal age at first birth, and total fertility rate differs substantially between the United States and the low- and middle-resource countries upon which most of the evidence is based. METHODS: To inform guideline development for birth spacing specific to women in the United States, the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) convened an expert work group meeting in Washington, DC, on 14-15 September 2017 among reproductive, perinatal, paediatric, social, and public health epidemiologists; obstetrician-gynaecologists; biostatisticians; and experts in evidence synthesis related to women's health. RESULTS: Presentations and discussion topics included the methodological quality of existing studies, evaluation of the evidence for causal effects of short interpregnancy intervals on adverse perinatal and maternal health outcomes, good practices for future research, and identification of research gaps and priorities for future work.

1095,"A genome-wide association study of early-onset breast cancer identifies PFKM as a novel breast cancer gene and supports a common genetic spectrum for breast cancer at any age Early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) causes substantial loss of life and productivity, creating a major burden among women worldwide. We analyzed 1,265,548 Hapmap3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among a discovery set of 3,523 EOBC incident cases and 2,702 population control women ages _ 51 years. The SNPs with smallest P values were examined in a replication set of 3,470 EOBC cases and 5,475 control women. We also tested EOBC association with 19,684 genes by annotating each gene with putative functional SNPs, and then combining their P values to obtain a gene-based P value. We examined the gene with smallest P value for replication in 1,145 breast cancer cases and 1,142 control women. The combined discovery and replication sets identified 72 new SNPs associated with EOBC (P < 4 _ 10(-8)) located in six genomic regions previously reported to contain SNPs associated largely with later-onset breast cancer (LOBC). SNP rs2229882 and 10 other SNPs on chromosome 5q11.2 remained associated (P < 6 _ 10(-4)) after adjustment for the strongest published SNPs in the region. Thirty-two of the 82 currently known LOBC SNPs were associated with EOBC (P < 0.05). Low power is likely responsible for the remaining 50 unassociated known LOBC SNPs. The gene-based analysis identified an association between breast cancer and the phosphofructokinase-muscle (PFKM) gene on chromosome 12q13.11 that met the genome-wide gene-based threshold of 2.5 _ 10(-6). In conclusion, EOBC and LOBC seem to have similar genetic etiologies; the 5q11.2 region may contain multiple distinct breast cancer loci; and the PFKM gene region is worthy of further investigation. These findings should enhance our understanding of the etiology of breast cancer.",,,8,,,
1096,"Invited commentary: evolution of social networks, health, and the role of epidemiology Almost 40 years ago, Berkman and Syme demonstrated that social networks were related to the risk of early mortality (Am J Epidemiol. 1979;109(2):186-204). Their study was highly innovative because they directly measured and quantified social networks in a large prospective population-based survey with mortality follow-up. The results of the study showed robust network gradients, whereby those with fewer networks and weaker social ties had significantly higher mortality rates. The important influence of social networks that Berkman and Syme noted many years ago is likely to heighten in the future, as demographic characteristics shift and individuals become more inclined to socialize through online platforms instead of real-world interactions. Berkman and Syme's research in 1979 continues to play a key role in shaping recent efforts to uncover the influence of social networks on health. Looking back on their findings may help epidemiologists better understand the importance of both online and offline networks for population health today. _ The Author 2017.

Large-scale intervention studies conducted over multiple influenza epidemics, as well as smaller studies in controlled laboratory settings, are needed to address the gaps in the research on transmission and mitigation of influenza in the community setting. The current novel influenza A (H1N1) pandemic underscores the importance of influenza research. Copyright (c) 2010 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

1100,"PTSD is associated with an increase in aged T cell phenotypes in adults living in Detroit BACKGROUND: Psychosocial stress is thought to play a key role in the acceleration of immunological aging. This study investigated the relationship between lifetime and past-year history of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the distribution of T cell phenotypes thought to be characteristic of immunological aging. METHODS: Data were from 85 individuals who participated in the community-based Detroit Neighborhood Health Study. Immune markers assessed included the CD4:CD8 ratio, the ratio of late-differentiated effector (CCR7-CD45RA+CD27-CD28-) to na_ve (CCR7+CD45RA+CD27+CD28+) T cells, the percentage of KLRG1-expressing cells, and the percentage of CD57-expressing cells. RESULTS: In models adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, and medication use, we found that past-year PTSD was associated with statistically significant differences in the CD8+ T cell population, including a higher ratio of late-differentiated effector to na_ve T cells, a higher percentage of KLRG1+ cells, and a higher percentage of CD57+ cells. The percentage of CD57+ cells in the CD4 subset was also significantly higher and the CD4:CD8 ratio significantly lower among individuals who had experienced past-year PTSD. Lifetime PTSD was also associated with differences in several parameters of immune aging. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD is associated with an aged immune phenotype and should be evaluated as a potential catalyzer of accelerated immunological aging in future studies. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1101,"Income and markers of immunological cellular aging OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic disadvantage may contribute to poor health through immune-related biological mechanisms. We examined the associations between socioeconomic status, as measured by annual household income, and T-cell markers of aging, including the ratios of CD4 and CD8 effector cells to na_ve cells (E/N ratio) and the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio. We hypothesized that participants with a lower income would have higher E/N ratios and lower CD4/CD8 ratios compared with participants with a higher income, and that these associations would be partially mediated by elevated cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibody levels, a virus implicated in aging and clonal expansion of T cells. METHODS: Data were from 79 individuals who participated in the population-based Detroit Neighborhood Health Study. We used linear regression to quantify the association between a $10,000 decrease in income and each ratio outcome. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, race, smoking, medication use, and lifetime history of mental health conditions, lower income was associated with a 0.41 (95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.72) log-unit increase in the CD4 E/N ratio and a 0.20 (95% confidence interval = 0.02-0.39) log-unit increase in the CD8 E/N ratio. CMV immunoglobulin G antibody level partially mediated these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that low socioeconomic status is associated with immunological aging as measured by the E/N ratio and that impaired immune control of CMV may partially mediate these associations.",,,1,,,
1102,"Introduction to the symposium: causal inference and public health Assessing the extent to which public health research findings can be causally interpreted continues to be a critical endeavor. In this symposium, we invited several researchers to review issues related to causal inference in social epidemiology and environmental science and to discuss the importance of external validity in public health. Together, this set of articles provides an integral overview of the strengths and limitations of applying causal inference frameworks and related approaches to a variety of public health problems, for both internal and external validity.",,,6,,,
1103,"The impact of pathogen burden on leukocyte telomere length in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Several infections have been linked to telomere shortening and in some cases these associations have varied by sex. We assessed the association between seropositivity to four persistent pathogens (cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus-1, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae), and total pathogen burden on leukocyte telomere length in a diverse US sample. Data came from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a population-based cohort study. We utilized cross-sectional survey data, and biological samples from participants tested for pathogens and telomere length (N = 163). Linear regression was used to examine the association between seropositivity for individual pathogens as well as total pathogen burden and telomere length, adjusting for various confounders. CMV seropositivity and increased total pathogen burden level were significantly associated with shorter telomere length among females (_ = -0_1204 (standard error (s.e.) 0_06), P = 0_044) and (_ = -0_1057 (s.e. = 0_05), P = 0_033), respectively. There was no statistically significant association among males. Our findings suggest that prevention or treatment of persistent pathogens, in particular CMV, may play an important role in reducing telomere shortening over the life course among women. Future research is needed to confirm these novel findings in larger longitudinal samples.",,,1,,,
1104,"Social Media- and Internet-Based Disease Surveillance for Public Health Disease surveillance systems are a cornerstone of public health tracking and prevention. This review addresses the use, promise, perils, and ethics of social media- and Internet-based data collection for public health surveillance. Our review highlights untapped opportunities for integrating digital surveillance in public health and current applications that could be improved through better integration, validation, and clarity on rules surrounding ethical considerations. Promising developments include hybrid systems that couple traditional surveillance data with data from search queries, social media posts, and crowdsourcing. In the future, it will be important to identify opportunities for public and private partnerships, train public health experts in data science, reduce biases related to digital data (gathered from Internet use, wearable devices, etc.), and address privacy. We are on the precipice of an unprecedented opportunity to track, predict, and prevent global disease burdens in the population using digital data.",,,2,,,
1105,"Design and methods of a social network isolation study for reducing respiratory infection transmission: The eX-FLU cluster randomized trial BACKGROUND: Social networks are increasingly recognized as important points of intervention, yet relatively few intervention studies of respiratory infection transmission have utilized a network design. Here we describe the design, methods, and social network structure of a randomized intervention for isolating respiratory infection cases in a university setting over a 10-week period. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 590 students in six residence halls enrolled in the eX-FLU study during a chain-referral recruitment process from September 2012-January 2013. Of these, 262 joined as ""seed"" participants, who nominated their social contacts to join the study, of which 328 ""nominees"" enrolled. Participants were cluster-randomized by 117 residence halls. Participants were asked to respond to weekly surveys on health behaviors, social interactions, and influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Participants were randomized to either a 3-Day dorm room isolation intervention or a control group (no isolation) upon illness onset. ILI cases reported on their isolation behavior during illness and provided throat and nasal swab specimens at onset, day-three, and day-six of illness. A subsample of individuals (N=103) participated in a sub-study using a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected sensor and contextually-dependent survey data on social interactions. Within the social network, participants were significantly positively assortative by intervention group, enrollment type, residence hall, iEpi participation, age, gender, race, and alcohol use (all P< 0.002). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We identified a feasible study design for testing the impact of isolation from social networks in a university setting. These data provide an unparalleled opportunity to address questions about isolation and infection transmission, as well as insights into social networks and behaviors among college-aged students. Several important lessons were learned over the course of this project, including feasible isolation durations, the need for extensive organizational efforts, as well as the need for specialized programmers and server space for managing survey and smartphone data.

1106,"Population levels of psychological stress, herpesvirus reactivation and HIV Nearly 40,000 Americans are newly infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) each year. Recently, studies have demonstrated associations between group-level characteristics and the prevalence and incidence of HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. Two mechanisms previously posited to explain these associations are neighborhood effects on risk behaviors and social or institutional policies. In this paper, we hypothesize that adversity at the population level, such as neighborhood poverty, also influences HIV risk through stress-mediated aberrations in immunological susceptibility by reviewing existing data examining each of these pathways. In particular, we review the evidence showing that: (1) Neighborhood ecologic stressors influence neighborhood- and individual-levels of mental health, psychosocial stress, and HIV/AIDS risk, (2) Individual-level psychosocial stressors influence progression from HIV to AIDS through stress-related hormonal changes, and (3) Individual-level psychosocial stressors influence HIV acquisition via stress-related reactivation of latent herpesviruses, specifically EBV and HSV-2. Our review indicates that further studies are needed to examine the joint pathways linking neighborhood-level sources of psychosocial stress, stress-related reactivation of HSV-2 and EBV, and increased acquisition rates of HIV. We suggest using a multi-level framework for targeting HIV prevention efforts that address not only behavioral risk factors, but structural, political, and institutional factors associated with neighborhood disadvantage, levels of psychosocial stress, and prevention or treatment of HSV-2 and EBV.",,,5,,,
1107,"An assessment of continued use and health impact of the concrete biosand filter in Bonao, Dominican Republic The biosand filter (BSF) is a promising point of use (POU) technology for water treatment; however there has been little follow-up of initial implementation to assess sustainability. The purpose of this study was to examine continued use, performance, and sustainability of previously implemented concrete BSFs in Bonao, Dominican Republic. Of 328 households visited and interviewed, 90% of BSFs were still in use after approximately 1 year since installation. Water-quality improvement, measured by fecal indicator bacteria reduction, was found to be 84-88%, which is lower than reductions in controlled laboratory studies but similar to other field assessments. In a short prospective cohort study comparing BSF to non-BSF households, odds of reported diarrheal disease in BSF households were 0.39 times the odds of reported diarrheal disease in non-BSF households. These results document high levels of sustained and effective concrete BSF use and associated improvements in water quality and health.",,,1,,,
1108,"Aspirin, ibuprofen, and the risk of colorectal cancer in lynch syndrome BACKGROUND: Inheritance of a germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 causes a high risk of colorectal and other cancers (Lynch Syndrome). Use of aspirin has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer for the general population as well as for MMR gene mutation carriers. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of aspirin and ibuprofen in a nontrial setting is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer risk for MMR gene mutation carriers. METHODS: We included 1858 participants in the Colon Cancer Family Registry who had been found to have a pathogenic germline mutation in a MMR gene (carriers). We used weighted Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 714 carriers (38%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a mean age of 42.4 (standard deviation 10.6) years. A reduced risk of colorectal cancer was associated with aspirin use (for 1 month to 4.9 years: HR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.90, P = .02; for _5 years: HR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.62, P = .003) and ibuprofen use (for 1 month to 4.9 years: HR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.79, P = .009; for _5 years: HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.69, P = .007), compared with less than one month of use. CONCLUSION: Our results provide additional evidence that, for MMR gene mutation carriers, use of aspirin and ibuprofen might be effective in reducing their high risk of colorectal cancer. _ The Author 2015.

1109,"Physical activity and healthy eating environmental audit tools in youth care settings: A systematic review BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in evaluating the physical activity (PA) and healthy eating (HE) policy and practice environment characteristics in settings frequented by youth (_18years). OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates the measurement properties of audit tools designed to assess PA and HE policy and practice environment characteristics in settings that care for youth (e.g., childcare, school, afterschool, summer camp). METHOD: Three electronic databases, reference lists, educational department and national health organizations' web pages were searched between January 1980 and February 2014 to identify tools assessing PA and/or HE policy and practice environments in settings that care for youth (_18years). RESULTS: Sixty-five audit tools were identified of which 53 individual tools met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-three tools assessed both the PA and HE domains, 6 assessed the PA domain and 14 assessed the HE domain solely. The majority of the tools were self-assessment tools (n=40), and were developed to assess the PA and/or HE environment in school settings (n=33), childcare (n=12), and after school programs (n=4). Four tools assessed the community at-large and had sections for assessing preschool, school and/or afterschool settings within the tool. The majority of audit tools lacked validity and/or reliability data (n=42). Inter-rater reliability and construct validity were the most frequently reported reliability (n=7) and validity types (n=5). CONCLUSIONS: Limited attention has been given to establishing the reliability and validity of audit tools for settings that care for youth. Future efforts should be directed towards establishing a strong measurement foundation for these important environmental audit tools. Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,4,,,
1110,"The healthy afterschool activity and nutrition documentation instrument BACKGROUND: Policies call on afterschool programs to improve the physical activity and nutrition habits of youth attending. No tool exists to assess the extent to which the afterschool program environment meets physical activity and nutrition policies. PURPOSE: To describe the development of the Healthy Afterschool Activity and Nutrition Documentation (HAAND) instrument, which consists of two subscales: Healthy Afterschool Program Index for Physical Activity (HAPI-PA) and the HAPI-Nutrition (HAPI-N). METHODS: Thirty-nine afterschool programs took part in the HAAND evaluation during fall/spring 2010-2011. Inter-rater reliability data were collected at 20 afterschool programs during a single site visit via direct observation, personal interview, and written document review. Validity of the HAPI-PA was established by comparing HAPI-PA scores to pedometer steps collected in a subsample of 934 children attending 25 of the afterschool programs. Validity of the HAPI-N scores was compared against the mean number of times/week that fruits and vegetables (FV) and whole grains were served in the program. RESULTS: Data were analyzed in June/July 2011. Inter-rater percent agreement was 85%-100% across all items. Increased pedometer steps were associated with the presence of a written policy related to physical activity, amount/quality of staff training, use of a physical activity curriculum, and offering activities that appeal to both genders. Higher servings of FV and whole grains per week were associated with the presence of a written policy regarding the nutritional quality of snacks. CONCLUSIONS: The HAAND instrument is a reliable and valid measurement tool that can be used to assess the physical activity and nutritional environment of afterschool programs.

1111,"Association of environment and policy characteristics on children's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and time spent sedentary in afterschool programs BACKGROUND: Afterschool programs are an important setting in which to promote children's physical activity. This study examines the association of environmental and policy characteristics on the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior of children attending afterschool programs. METHODS: A total of 1302 children attending 20 afterschool programs across South Carolina wore accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X+) for up to 4non-consecutive days. Policy-level characteristics were evaluated using the Healthy Afterschool Program Index-Physical Activity scale. Physical activity space was measured using a measuring wheel (indoor, ft(2)) and Geographical Information Systems software (outdoor, acres). The structure (free-play or organized) of activity opportunities was evaluated via direct observation. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary, both indoors and outdoors, was estimated using accelerometry. RESULTS: For every 5000 ft(2) of utilized indoor activity space an additional 2.4 and 3.3 min/day of sedentary behavior was observed among boys and girls, respectively. A higher ratio of free-play to organized play was associated with higher indoor sedentary behavior among boys and girls (3.9 min/day and 10.0 min/day, respectively). For every 1 acre of outdoor activity space used, an additional 2.7 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was observed for boys. A higher free-play to organized play ratio was associated with higher outdoor moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for boys and girls (4.4 and 3.4 min/day increase, respectively). Policy characteristics were unrelated to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels and time spent sedentary. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that policies and size of activity space had limited influence on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior, suggesting that a programmatic structure may be a more effective option to improve moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels of children attending afterschool programs.

1112,"Variation in sexual behaviors in a cohort of adolescent females: the role of personal, perceived peer, and perceived family attitudes PURPOSE: Little is known about how adolescent sexual behaviors develop and the influence of personal or perceived social attitudes. We sought to describe how personal, perceived peer, and perceived family attitudes toward adolescent sexual activity influence sexual behaviors of adolescent females' over time. METHODS: Between the years of 1999 and 2006, 358 English-speaking female adolescents, aged 14-17 years, were recruited from three urban adolescent clinics. Participants completed quarterly and annual questionnaires over a span of 4 years. Primary outcomes included engagement in any of the following eight sexual behaviors: kissing, having breasts touched, having genitals touched, touching partners' genitals, oral giving, oral receiving, anal, or vaginal sex. Three attitudinal scales assessed personal importance of abstinence, perceived peer beliefs about when to have sex, and perceived family beliefs that adolescent sex is negative. We used generalized estimating equations to identify predictors of each sexual behavior and compared whether personal, perceived peer, or perceived family attitudes predicted sexual behaviors over time. RESULTS: The odds of reporting each sexual behavior increased with age but were lower among those whose personal or perceived family attitudes were less positive. Participants' personal attitudes toward adolescent sex were the strongest predictor of engagement in all eight sexual behaviors even after controlling for perceived peer and perceived family attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Female adolescent's personal attitudes toward abstinence appear to be the strongest predictor of engagement in a variety of sexual behaviors. Efforts to influence adolescent attitudes toward abstinence may be an important approach to reducing sexual behaviors that increase the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

1113,"Views of young, rural African Americans of the role of community social institutions in HIV prevention BACKGROUND: We explored rural African American youths' perceptions about the role of community social institutions in addressing HIV. METHODS: We conducted four focus groups with African Americans aged 16 to 24 years in two rural counties in North Carolina. Groups were stratified by gender and risk status. We used a grounded theory approach to content analysis. RESULTS: Participants identified four social institutions as primary providers of HIV-related health promotion efforts: faith organizations, schools, politicians, and health agencies. They reported perceiving a lack of involvement in HIV prevention by faith-based organizations, constraints of abstinence-based sex education policies, politicians' lack of interest in addressing broader HIV determinants, and inadequacies in health agency services, and viewed all of these as being counter-productive to HIV prevention efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Youth have important insights about local social institutions that should be considered when designing HIV prevention interventions that partner with local organizations.",,,6,,,
1114,"The role of patient-provider communication: a qualitative study of patient attitudes regarding co-occurring depression and chronic diseases in Malawi BACKGROUND: Globally, depression is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality particularly in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are also increasing in LMICs, the conditions frequently co-occur and exacerbate NCD outcomes. Depression interventions alone are not effective at improving NCD outcomes, resulting in wide-reaching calls for integrated services. Integrated services are in a nascent phase in LMICs in general and in Malawi in particular. This manuscript serves to clarify Malawian patients' attitudes and perceptions towards depression integration into routine NCD services. METHODS: Ten District Hospitals were selected for data collection and 2 participants were interviewed from each site (N_=_20). An iterative approach to concept-driven coding was applied to facilitate the formation of similarities, differences, and connections between codes. RESULTS: While patients infrequently described moderate depression as a medical condition, and held various attitudes regarding treatments, they agreed on the appropriateness of integrated services. Patients' respect for their providers led them to support integration. Patients discussed how medical knowledge is highly regarded, revealing a power dynamic with their providers. Patients further acknowledged the importance of a provider's communication in shaping a patient's feelings about depression. CONCLUSIONS: Training and interventions that facilitate providers' abilities to transfer their medical knowledge, use strategies to channel their power, and engage patients in a meaningful and collaborative relationship will be key to successfully integrating depression treatment into Malawian NCD clinics.

1115,"Do Genetic Markers of Inflammation Modify the Relationship between Periodontitis and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease? Findings from the SHIP Study An association between periodontitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been reported by experimental animal and epidemiologic studies. This study investigated whether circulating levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and a weighted genetic CRP score representing markers of inflammatory burden modify the association between periodontitis and NAFLD. Data came from 2,481 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania who attended baseline examination that occurred between 1997 and 2001. Periodontitis was defined as the percentage of sites (0%, < 30%, _30%) with probing pocket depth (PD) _4 mm, and NAFLD status was determined using liver ultrasound assessment. Serum CRP levels were assayed at a central laboratory, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously identified through genome-wide association studies as robustly associated with serum CRP were combined into a weighted genetic CRP score (wGSCRP). Logistic regression models estimated the association between periodontitis and NAFLD within strata of serum CRP and separately within strata of the wGSCRP. The prevalence of NAFLD was 26.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6, 28.1) while 17.8% (95% CI, 16.0-19.6) had _30% of sites with PD _4 mm. Whereas the wGSCRP was not a modifier ( Pinteraction = 0.8) on the multiplicative scale, serum CRP modified the relationship between periodontitis and NAFLD ( Pinteraction = 0.01). The covariate-adjusted prevalence odds ratio of NAFLD comparing participants with _30% of sites with PD _4 mm to those with no site affected was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.32-4.31) among participants with serum CRP < 1 mg/L. The corresponding estimate was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.57-1.66) for participants with serum CRP levels of 1 to 3 mg/L and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.65-1.93) for participants with serum CRP >3 mg/L.

1116,"Periodontitis and prevalence of elevated aminotransferases in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence is greater among Hispanics/Latinos than other racial/ethnic groups and prevalence is further reported to vary among Hispanic/Latino background groups. Experimental animal and human studies demonstrate associations between periodontitis and NAFLD, not yet reported among Hispanics/Latinos. This study examined periodontitis as a novel risk factor that may contribute to the burden of NAFLD among Hispanics/Latinos. METHODS: Data came from 11,914 participants of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Periodontitis was defined as the extent (none,_< _30%, _30%) of periodontal sites with clinical attachment level (CAL) of _3_mm or probing pocket depth (PD) of _4_mm. Elevated serum transaminases indicative of suspected NAFLD were defined as having alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT)_>_40 IU/L or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)_>_37 IU/L for men and ALT_>_31 IU/L or AST_>_31 IU/L for women. Survey-logistic regression models estimated prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between periodontitis and suspected NAFLD. RESULTS: The overall age-standardized percentage of study participants with_< _30% of sites with CAL _3_mm or PD _4_mm was 53.5% and 58.6%, respectively, while participants with _30% sites with CAL _3_mm or PD _4_mm comprised 16% and 5.72%, respectively. The overall age-standardized prevalence (95% CI) of suspected NAFLD was 18.1% (17.1-19.0). For the entire cohort, we observed a dose-response (i.e. graded) association between PD _4_mm and the prevalence odds of suspected NAFLD, whereby participants with_< _30% affected had a crude POR_=_1.19 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.38) while participants with _30% affected had a crude POR_=_1.39 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.90). These crude estimates were attenuated toward the null and rendered non-significant upon covariate adjustment. No differences were found by Hispanic/Latino background group.

1117,"Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and periodontitis prevalence among nonsmokers in the hispanic community Health Study/Study of Latinos OBJECTIVE: To describe self-reported exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and its association with periodontitis prevalence in a diverse group of Hispanics/Latinos. METHODS: Data came from 8675 lifetime nonsmokers in the 2008-2011 Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Exposure to ETS was self-reported, while periodontitis was defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-American Academy of Periodontology criteria and the proportion of sites affected by clinical attachment level of _3 mm or pocket depth of _4 mm. Survey logistic regression estimated prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In addition, we assessed whether greater hours of exposure to ETS in the past year was associated with greater periodontitis prevalence, and lastly, we conducted a simple sensitivity analysis of ETS misclassification. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence estimates (95% CI) for ETS exposure and periodontitis were 57.6% (55.9, 59.4) and 39.8% (38.1, 41.4), respectively. After adjusting for confounders and periodontitis risk factors, we estimated an overall adjusted POR (95% CI) for the ETS-periodontitis association as 1.09 (0.95-1.26) with a confidence limit ratio (CLR) of 1.34. This association varied in magnitude by Hispanic/Latino background, ranging from 1.04 (0.75, 1.43 with a CLR = 1.91) among Central Americans to 1.76 (1.16, 2.66 with a CLR = 2.29) in Puerto Ricans. CONCLUSIONS: Previously reported associations between ETS and periodontitis appear weak in this study. However, the magnitude of the association differs according to Hispanic/Latino background. _ 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,5,,,
1118,"Bias in estimating the cross-sectional smoking, alcohol, obesity and diabetes associations with moderate-severe periodontitis in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study: comparison of full versus partial-mouth estimates OBJECTIVE: To assess whether partial-mouth protocols (PRPs) result in biased estimates of the associations between smoking, alcohol, obesity and diabetes with periodontitis. METHODS: Using a sample (n_=_6129) of the 1996-1998 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, we used measures of probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level to identify moderate-severe periodontitis. Adjusting for confounders, unconditional binary logistic regression estimated prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence limits. Specifically, we compared POR for smoking, alcohol, obesity and diabetes with periodontitis derived from full-mouth to those derived from 4-PRPs (Ramfj_rd, National Health and Nutrition Examination survey-III, modified-NHANES-IV and 42-site-Random-site selection-method). Finally, we conducted a simple sensitivity analysis of periodontitis misclassification by changing the case definition threshold for each PRP. RESULTS: In comparison to full-mouth PORs, PRP PORs were biased in terms of magnitude and direction. Holding the full-mouth case definition at moderate-severe periodontitis and setting it at mild-moderate-severe for the PRPs did not consistently produce POR estimates that were either biased towards or away from the null in comparison to full-mouth estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Partial-mouth protocols result in misclassification of periodontitis and may bias epidemiologic measures of association. The magnitude and direction of this bias depends on choice of PRP and case definition threshold used. _ 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,1,,,
1119,"Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Association Between Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Periodontitis Endpoints Among Nonsmokers OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to summarize the epidemiological evidence on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and prevalent periodontitis endpoints among nonsmokers. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Pro-Quest dissertations, and conference proceedings of a dental research association. We included studies from which prevalence odds ratios (POR) could be extracted for periodontitis determined by examiner measurements of clinical attachment level (CAL) and/or probing pocket depth (PD) or self-report of missing teeth. Studies determined ETS exposure by self-report or biomarker (cotinine) levels. RESULTS: For studies reporting CAL and/or PD (n = 6), associations were stronger with cotinine-measured exposure (n = 3; random effects POR [95% prediction interval] = 1.63 (0.90, 2.96)) than self-reported exposure (n = 3; random effects POR = 1.15 (0.68, 1.96)). There was no meaningful difference in summary estimate for studies reporting CAL and/or PD endpoint (n = 6; random effects POR = 1.34 (0.93, 1.94)) as opposed to tooth loss (n = 2; random effects POR = 1.33 (0.52, 3.40)). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a positive association between exposure to ETS and prevalent periodontitis endpoints among nonsmokers, the magnitude of which depended mostly on the method of ETS assessment. IMPLICATIONS: The notoriety of ETS is often discussed in terms of its associations with cancer, chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory illnesses in children. However, very little attention is paid to its association with oral diseases, especially periodontitis. Periodontitis affects a large proportion of the population and is a major cause of tooth loss. This study summarized the epidemiologic association between exposure to ETS and periodontitis among nonsmokers.

1120,"Life-course exposure to early socioeconomic environment, education in relation to late-life cognitive function among older Mexicans and Mexican Americans OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between life-course education and late-life cognitive function along with the modifying role of migration history. METHOD: The combined sample includes 1,789 participants from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging and 5,253 participants from the Mexican Health and Aging Study. Aged 60+ at baseline, participants were classified as Mexican residents, Mexicans-return migrants, Mexicans-immigrants to the United States, and Mexicans-U.S. born. Cognitive function was measured using standardized z scores of a short-term verbal recall test. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants' z scores were higher among those whose mother had more than elementary education (_ = 0.28, p < .05). Participant's education mediated this association. For 5-year difference in education, the cognitive z score increased by 0.3 points for a U.S. born. Results were similar with father's education. DISCUSSION: Adult educational attainment mediates the effect of childhood socioeconomic status on late-life cognition. Migration plays a role in shaping cognitive aging.",,,1,,,
1121,"Heritability of ambulatory and beat-to-beat office blood pressure in large multigenerational Arab pedigrees: the 'Oman Family study' OBJECTIVE: To estimate the heritability of ambulatory blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and beat-to-beat office BP and HR in an isolated, environmentally and genetically homogeneous Omani Arab population. METHODS: Ambulatory BP measurements were recorded in 1,124 subjects with a mean age of 33.8 _ 16.2 years, using the auscultatory mode of the validated Schiller ambulatory BP Monitor. Beat-to-beat BP and HR were recorded by the Task Force Monitor. Heritability was estimated using quantitative genetic analysis. This was achieved by applying the maximum-likelihood-based variance decomposition method implemented in SOLAR software. RESULTS: We detected statistically significant heritability estimates for office beat-to-beat, 24-hour, daytime, and sleep HR of 0.31, 0.21, 0.20, and 0.07, respectively. Heritability estimates in the above mentioned conditions for systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP)/mean BP (MBP)were all significant and estimated at 0.19/0.19/0.19, 0.30/0.44/0.41, 0.28/0.38/0.39, and 0.21/0.18/0.20,respectively. Heritability estimates for 24-hour and daytime ambulatory SBP, DBP, and MBP ranged from 0.28 to 0.44, and were higher than the heritability estimates for beat-to-beat recordings and sleep periods,which were estimated within a narrow range of 0.18-0.21. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, because shared environments are common to all, the environmental influence that occurs is primarily due to the variation in non-shared environment that is unique to the individual. We demonstrated significant heritability estimates for both beat-to-beat office and ambulatory BP and HR recordings, but 24-hour and daytime ambulatory heritabilities are higher than those from beat-to-beat resting levels and ambulatory night-time recordings.",,,9,,,
1122,"Reducing overuse of cervical cancer screening: A systematic review Overuse of clinical preventive services increases healthcare costs and may deprive underserved patients of necessary care. Up to 45% of cervical cancer screening is overuse. We conducted a systematic review of correlates of overuse of cervical cancer screening and interventions to reduce overuse. The search identified 25 studies (20 observational; 5 intervention). Correlates varied by the type of overuse measured (i.e., too frequent, before/after recommended age to start or stop screening, after hysterectomy), the most common correlates of overuse related to patient age (n_=_7), OBGYN practice or provider (n_=_5), location (n_=_4), and marital status (n_=_4). Six observational studies reported a decrease in overuse over time. Screening overuse decreased in all intervention studies, which used before-after designs with no control or comparison groups. Observational studies suggest potential targets for de-escalating overuse. Randomized clinical trials are needed to establish best practices for reducing overuse. Copyright _ 2018 Elsevier Inc.

1123,"Cumulative psychological stress and cardiovascular disease risk in middle aged and older women: Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics Although a growing body of evidence indicates strong links between psychological stress (stress) and untoward cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, comprehensive examination of these effects remains lacking. The ""Cumulative Psychological Stress and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Middle Aged and Older Women"" study is embedded within the landmark Women's Health Study (WHS) follow-up cohort and seeks to evaluate the individual and joint effects of stressors (cumulative stress) on incident CVD risk, including myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization and CVD death. GWAS data will be used for exploratory analyses to identify any genes associated with stress and CVD. This study prospectively follows 25,335 women (mean age 72.2 _ 6.04 years) without CVD who returned a short mailed stress questionnaire at baseline and 3 years of follow-up inquiring about their experiences with stress including perceived stress, work stress, work-family spillover, financial stress, traumatic and major life events, discrimination and neighborhood environment/stressors. Other domains ascertained were sleep, anger, cynical hostility, depression, anxiety, social support, intimate partner relations, and volunteer and social activities. Higher levels of cumulative stress were associated with younger age and black race/ethnicity, divorced or separated marital status, increased prevalence of obesity, smoking, diabetes, depression and anxiety (p< 0.001 for each). Findings from this study will provide clinically important, new information about associations of cumulative stress, environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors with incident CVD risk in aging women.

1124,"The basic research factors questionnaire for studying early childhood caries BACKGROUND: We describe development of the Early Childhood Caries (ECC) Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (BRFQ), a battery of measures assessing common potential predictors, mediators, and moderators of ECC. Individual-, family-, and community-level factors that are linked to oral health outcomes across at-risk populations are included. Developing standard measures of factors implicated in ECC has the potential to enhance our ability to understand mechanisms underlying successful prevention and to develop more effective interventions. METHODS: The Early Childhood Caries Collaborating Centers (EC4), funded by National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, developed the BRFQ, which was used across four randomized trials to develop and test interventions for reducing ECC in at-risk populations. Forty-five investigators from across the centers and NIDCR were involved in the development process. Eight ""measures working groups"" identified relevant constructs and effective measurement approaches, which were then categorized as ""essential"" or ""optional"" common data elements (CDEs) for the EC4 projects. RESULTS: Essential CDEs include 88 items, with an additional 177 measures categorized as optional CDEs. Essential CDEs fell under the following domains: oral health knowledge, oral health behavior, utilization/insurance and cost, parent/caregiver dental self-efficacy, quality of life, caregiver and family characteristics, and child characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The BRFQ makes available a battery of measures that support efforts to understand population risk factors for ECC and to compare oral health outcomes across populations at risk. The BRFQ development process may be useful to other clinical research networks and consortia developing CDEs in other health research fields. TRIAL REGISTRATION: All the trial that used the BRFQ were registered at Clinicaltrial.gov NCT01116726 , April 29, 2010; NCT01116739 , May 3, 2010; NCT01129440 , May 21, 2010; and NCT01205971 , September 19, 2010.",,,1,,,
1125,"Exploring secular changes in the association between BMI and waist circumference in Mexican-origin and white women: a comparison of Mexico and the United States OBJECTIVES: BMI and waist circumference (WC) tend to be highly correlated, but changes in lifestyle behaviors may promote greater accumulation of abdominal fat for the same BMI in recent years. We examined secular shifts in BMI and WC distributions, and investigated whether WC for a given BMI has changed over time among Mexican-origin women in Mexico and the US, and in US white women as a comparison. METHODS: Nationally representative surveys for women aged 20-49 years from Mexico (1988, 1999, and 2012) (n_=_37,116) and the US (1988-1994, 1999-2002, and 2007-2010) (n_=_6,985) were used. Quantile regressions estimated age-adjusted changes in BMI and WC across years; linear regression tested changes in mean WC over time, adjusting for age and BMI. RESULTS: In all women, BMI and WC at most centiles increased over time. WC was also significantly higher over time for the same BMI, though the increase was largest in Mexican women. For example, WC was 6.7 cm (standard error (SE): 0.17, P_< _0.0001) higher in 2012 than in 1999 among Mexican women, holding age and BMI constant. Estimates were smaller in magnitude for Mexican-American and white women (_3 cm, P_< _0.01), even when comparing over a longer timeframe (1988-1994 to 2007-2010). In all groups, WC adjusted for BMI increased to a larger extent among younger cohorts. CONCLUSION: WC for the same BMI has increased in Mexican-American, white, and Mexican women of reproductive age. These patterns may have implications for future cardio-metabolic burden in Mexico and the US. _ 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,
1126,"Secular trends in the association between nativity/length of US residence with body mass index and waist circumference among Mexican-Americans, 1988-2008 OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether associations between nativity/length of US residence and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) varied over the past two decades. METHODS: Mexican-Americans aged 20-64 years from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) III (1988-1994), and NHANES (1999-2008). Sex-stratified multivariable linear regression models further adjusted for age, education, and NHANES period. RESULTS: We found no evidence of secular variation in the nativity/length of US residence gradient for men or women. Foreign-born Mexican-Americans, irrespective of residence length, had lower mean BMI and WC than their US-born counterparts. However among women, education modified secular trends in nativity differentials: notably, in less-educated women, nativity gradients widened over time due to alarming increases in BMI among the US-born and little increase in the foreign-born. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between nativity/length of US residence and BMI/WC did not vary over this 20-year period, but we noted important modifications by education in women. Understanding these trends is important for identifying vulnerable subpopulations among Mexican-Americans and for the development of effective health promotion strategies in this fast-growing segment of the population.",,,3,,,
1127,"Ethnic differences in body mass index trajectories from adolescence to adulthood: a focus on Hispanic and Asian subgroups in the United States BACKGROUND: Compared to whites, U.S. Hispanics have higher obesity rates; U.S. Asians have lower rates. However Hispanics and Asians are each comprised of several ethnic subgroups that differ with respect to country of origin, immigration history, and geographic distribution across the U.S. Among adolescents, ethnic differences in obesity have been previously reported, but no studies have examined longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI) by Hispanic and Asian subgroup category to understand when and why these disparities emerge, especially during the critical transition between adolescence and adulthood. METHODS: Using nationally-representative, longitudinal data from 1355 Hispanics (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central/South American, Other Hispanic), 520 Asians (Chinese, Filipino, Other Asian), and 5061whites from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves II-IV: 1996-2009), we used linear mixed spline models to examine whether Hispanic and Asian adolescent subgroups shared the same BMI trajectories as whites as they aged into adulthood. We also investigated the role of social and behavioral factors in explaining race/ethnic differences. RESULTS: Among Hispanics, Mexican and Puerto Rican-origin individuals exhibited faster increases in BMI both in adolescence and in adulthood and these patterns were not attributable to the measured social and behavioral factors. There was also evidence of emerging disparities in Cuban males, and in Central/South Americans relative to whites. In contrast, Chinese, Filipino, and Other Asian adolescents had significantly lower BMI and slower BMI increases in adulthood compared to whites. In models adjusted for social and behavioral factors, Chinese-white and Other Asian-white differentials remained unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregate estimates of Hispanics and Asians mask important heterogeneity in BMI. A better understanding of weight dynamics early in the life course can inform how and when disparities emerge to better target prevention efforts.",,,4,,,
1128,"Socioeconomic gradients in body mass index (BMI) in US immigrants during the transition to adulthood: examining the roles of parental education and intergenerational educational mobility BACKGROUND: Despite comparatively lower socioeconomic status (SES), immigrants tend to have lower body weight and weaker SES gradients relative to US-born individuals. Yet, it is unknown how changes in SES over the life-course relate to body weight in immigrants versus US-born individuals. METHODS: We used longitudinal data from a nationally representative, diverse sample of 13_701 adolescents followed into adulthood to investigate whether associations between SES mobility categories (educational attainment reported by individuals as adults and by their parents during adolescence) and body mass index (BMI) measured in adulthood varied by immigrant generation. Weighted multivariable linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and immigrant generation. RESULTS: Among first-generation immigrants, although parental education was not associated with adult BMI, an immigrant's own education attainment was inversely associated with BMI (_=-2.6__g/m(2); SE=0.9, p< 0.01). In addition, upward educational mobility was associated with lower adult mean BMI than remaining low SES (_=-2.5__g/m(2); SE=1.2, p< 0.05). In contrast, among US-born respondents, college education in adulthood did not attenuate the negative association between parental education and adult BMI. Although an SES gradient emerged in adulthood for immigrants, remaining low SES from adolescence to adulthood was not associated with loss of health advantage relative to US-born respondents of US-born parents of similar SES. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants were able to translate higher SES in adulthood into a lower adult mean BMI regardless of childhood SES, whereas the consequences of lower childhood SES had a longer reach even among the upwardly mobile US born.

1129,"Is waist circumference per body mass index rising differentially across the United States, England, China and Mexico? BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Little is known about whether waist circumference (WC) has increased disproportionately relative to body mass index (BMI) around the world. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data came from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994 and 2007-2010), Health Survey for England (1992-1993 and 2008-2009); the Mexican Nutrition Survey (1999) and the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHNS 2012); and the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1993 and 2011). Country- and sex-stratified (for the United States, also race-/ethnicity-stratified) multivariable linear regressions were used to estimate mean difference in WC over time relative to BMI at specified overweight and obesity cutoff points, adjusting for age and survey year. RESULTS: Although mean WC and BMI shifted upward over time in all age-sex subpopulations in all four countries, trends in overweight prevalence were less consistent. However, WC relative to BMI increased at varying magnitudes across all countries and subpopulations, except US Black men. The magnitude of increase was largest for women in the youngest age group (20-29 years), particularly for women in Mexico (+6.6 cm, P< 0.0001) and China (+4.6 cm, P< 0.0001) (holding BMI constant at 25 kg/m(2)). For men, the increase was primarily evident among Chinese men (+4.8 cm, P< 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: WC has increased disproportionately over time relative to overall body mass across the United States, England, Mexico and China, particularly among young women, with the largest increases occurring in the middle-income countries of Mexico and China. These patterns are potentially a cause for concern especially for countries undergoing rapid economic and nutritional transitions.",,,3,,,
1130,"Secular and race/ethnic trends in glycemic outcomes by BMI in US adults: The role of waist circumference BACKGROUND: For the same body mass index (BMI) level, waist circumference (WC) is higher in more recent years. How this impacts diabetes and prediabetes prevalence in the United States and for different race/ethnic groups is unknown. We examined prevalence differences in diabetes and prediabetes by BMI over time, investigated whether estimates were attenuated after adjusting for waist circumference, and evaluated implications of these patterns on race/ethnic disparities in glycemic outcomes. METHODS: Data came from 12_614 participants aged 20 to 74_years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1988-1994 and 2007-2012). We estimated prevalence differences in diabetes and prediabetes by BMI over time in multivariable models. Relevant interactions evaluated race/ethnic differences. RESULTS: Among normal, overweight, and class I obese individuals, there were no significant differences in diabetes prevalence over time. However, among individuals with class II/III obesity, diabetes prevalence rose 7.6 percentage points in 2007-2012 vs 1988-1994. This estimate was partly attenuated after adjustment for mean waist circumference but not mean BMI. For prediabetes, prevalence was 10 to 13 percentage points higher over time at lower BMI values, with minimal attenuation after adjustment for WC. All patterns held within race/ethnic groups. Diabetes disparities among blacks and Mexican Americans relative to whites remained in both periods, regardless of BMI, and persisted after adjustment for WC. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes prevalence rose over time among individuals with class II/III obesity and may be partly due to increasing waist circumference. Anthropometric measures did not appear to account for temporal increases in prediabetes, nor did they attenuate race/ethnic disparities in diabetes. Reasons underlying these trends require further investigation. Copyright _ 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,4,,,
1131,"Preventive care quality of medicare accountable care organizations: associations of organizational characteristics with performance BACKGROUND: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are a delivery and payment model aiming to coordinate care, control costs, and improve quality. Medicare ACOs are responsible for 8 measures of preventive care quality. OBJECTIVES: To create composite measures of preventive care quality and examine associations of ACO characteristics with performance. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study of Medicare Shared Savings Program and Pioneer participants. We linked quality performance to descriptive data from the National Survey of ACOs. We created composite measures using exploratory factor analysis, and used regression to assess associations with organizational characteristics. RESULTS: Of 252 eligible ACOs, 246 reported on preventive care quality, 177 of which completed the survey (response rate=72%). In their first year, ACOs lagged behind PPO performance on the majority of comparable measures. We identified 2 underlying factors among 8 measures and created composites for each: disease prevention, driven by vaccines and cancer screenings, and wellness screening, driven by annual health screenings. Participation in the Advanced Payment Model, having fewer specialists, and having more Medicare ACO beneficiaries per primary care provider were associated with significantly better performance on both composites. Better performance on disease prevention was also associated with inclusion of a hospital, greater electronic health record capabilities, a larger primary care workforce, and fewer minority beneficiaries. CONCLUSIONS: ACO preventive care quality performance is related to provider composition and benefitted by upfront investment. Vaccine and cancer screening quality performance is more dependent on organizational structure and characteristics than performance on annual wellness screenings, likely due to greater complexity in eligibility determination and service administration.",,,2,,,
1132,"The role of psychological safety and learning behavior in the development of effective quality improvement teams in Ghana: an observational study BACKGROUND: As lower-income countries look to develop a mature healthcare workforce and to improve quality and reduce costs, they are increasingly turning to quality improvement (QI), a widely-used strategy in higher-income countries. Although QI is an effective strategy for promoting evidence-based practices, QI interventions often fail to deliver desired results. This failure may reflect a problem with implementation. As the key implementing unit of QI, teams are critical for the success or failure of QI efforts. Thus, we used the model of work-team learning to identify factors related to the effectiveness of newly-formed hospital-based QI teams in Ghana. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational study. We used structural equation modeling to estimate relationships between coaching-oriented team leadership, perceived support for teamwork, team psychological safety, team learning behavior, and QI implementation. We used an observer-rated measure of QI implementation, our outcome of interest. Team-level factors were measured using aggregated survey data from 490 QI team members, resulting in a sample size of 122 teams. We assessed model fit and tested significance of standardized parameters, including direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: Learning behavior mediated a positive relationship between psychological safety and QI implementation (__=_0.171, p_=_0.001). Psychological safety mediated a positive relationship between team leadership and learning behavior (__=_0.384, p_=_0.068). Perceived support for teamwork did not have a significant effect on psychological safety or learning behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological safety and learning behavior are key for the success of newly formed QI teams working in lower-income countries. Organizational leaders and implementation facilitators should consider these leverage points as they work to establish an environment where QI and other team-based activities are supported and encouraged.",,,2,,,
1133,"Contribution of medications and risk factors to QTc interval lengthening in the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: Prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The association between QTc interval-prolonging medications (QTPMs) and risk factors with magnitude of QTc interval lengthening is unknown. We examined the contribution of risk factors alone and in combination with QTPMs to QTc interval lengthening. METHOD: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study assessed 15_792 participants with a resting, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and _1 measure of QTc interval over 4 examinations at 3-year intervals (1987-1998). From 54_638 person-visits, we excluded participants with QRS___120_milliseconds (n_=_2333 person-visits). We corrected the QT interval using the Bazett and Framingham formulas. We examined QTc lengthening using linear regression for 36_602 person-visit observations for 14_160 cohort members controlling for age___65 years, female sex, left ventricular hypertrophy, QTc_>_500_milliseconds at the prior visit, and CredibleMeds categorized QTPMs (Known, Possible, or Conditional risk). We corrected standard errors for repeat observations per person. RESULTS: Eighty percent of person-visits had at least one risk factor for QTc lengthening. Use of QTPMs increased over the 4 visits from 8% to 17%. Among persons not using QTPMs, history of prolonged QTc interval and female sex were associated with the greatest QTc lengthening, 39 and 12_milliseconds, respectively. In the absence of risk factors, Known QTPMs and _2 QTPMs were associated with modest but greater QTc lengthening than Possible or Conditional QTPMs. In the presence of risk factors, _2 QTPM further increased QTc lengthening. In combination with risk factors, the association of all QTPM categories with QTc lengthening was greater than QTPMs alone. CONCLUSION: Risk factors, particularly female sex and history of prolonged QTc interval, have stronger associations with QTc interval lengthening than any QTPM category alone. All QTPM categories augmented QTc interval lengthening associated with risk factors. _ 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,3,,,
1134,"Employment status and the association of sociocultural stress with sleep in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) STUDY OBJECTIVES: We examined the association of sociocultural stress severity (i.e. acculturation stress, ethnic discrimination) and chronic stress burden with multiple dimensions of sleep in a population-based sample of US Hispanics/Latinos. We also explored whether employment status modified stress-sleep associations. METHODS: We conducted survey linear regressions to test the cross-sectional association of sociocultural stress severity and stress burden with sleep dimensions using data collected between 2010 and 2013 from individuals who participated in both the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Sue_o and Sociocultural Ancillary studies (N = 1192). RESULTS: Greater acculturation stress (B = 0.75, standard error [SE] = 0.26, p < .01) and chronic psychosocial stress burden (B = 1.04, SE = 0.18, p < .001) were associated with greater insomnia symptoms but were not associated with actigraphic measures of sleep. Ethnic discrimination was not associated with any of the sleep dimensions. The association of acculturation stress with insomnia severity was greater in unemployed (B = 2.06, SE = 0.34) compared to employed (B = 1.01, SE = 0.31) participants (p-interaction = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Acculturation stress severity and chronic stress burden are important and consistent correlates of insomnia, but not actigraphically measured sleep dimensions. If replicated, future research should test whether interventions targeting the resolution of sociocultural stress improve sleep quality in Hispanics/Latinos. _ Sleep Research Society 2019.

A key gap in many efforts is the transformation of community prevention systems to support and sustain local infrastructure for the active implementation, scaling, and continuous improvement of effective prevention strategies. In this paper, we discuss (1) the emergence of applied implementation science as an important type 3-5 translational extension of traditional type 2 translational prevention science, (2) active implementation and scaling functions to support the full and effective use of evidence-based prevention strategies in practice, (3) the organization and alignment of local infrastructure to embed active implementation and scaling functions within community prevention systems, and (4) policy and practice implications for greater social impact and sustainable use of effective prevention strategies.",,,7,,,
1136,"Twin and family studies reveal strong environmental and weaker genetic cues explaining heritability of eosinophilic esophagitis BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-driven allergic inflammatory disease, likely involving the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, yet their respective contributions to heritability are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk associated with genes and environment on familial clustering of EoE. METHODS: Family history was obtained from a hospital-based cohort of 914 EoE probands (n = 2192 first-degree ""Nuclear-Family"" relatives) and an international registry of monozygotic and dizygotic twins/triplets (n = 63 EoE ""Twins"" probands). Frequencies, recurrence risk ratios (RRRs), heritability, and twin concordance were estimated. Environmental exposures were preliminarily examined. RESULTS: Analysis of the Nuclear-Family-based cohort revealed that the rate of EoE, in first-degree relatives of a proband, was 1.8% (unadjusted) and 2.3% (sex-adjusted). RRRs ranged from 10 to 64, depending on the family relationship, and were higher in brothers (64.0; P = .04), fathers (42.9; P = .004), and males (50.7; P < .001) than in sisters, mothers, and females, respectively. The risk of EoE for other siblings was 2.4%. In the Nuclear-Family cohort, combined gene and common environment heritability was 72.0% _ 2.7% (P < .001). In the Twins cohort, genetic heritability was 14.5% _ 4.0% (P < .001), and common family environment contributed 81.0% _ 4% (P < .001) to phenotypic variance. Probandwise concordance in monozygotic co-twins was 57.9% _ 9.5% compared with 36.4% _ 9.3% in dizygotic co-twins (P = .11). Greater birth weight difference between twins (P = .01), breast-feeding (P = .15), and fall birth season (P = .02) were associated with twin discordance in disease status. CONCLUSIONS: EoE RRRs are increased 10- to 64-fold compared with the general population. EoE in relatives is 1.8% to 2.4%, depending on relationship and sex. Nuclear-Family heritability appeared to be high (72.0%). However, the Twins cohort analysis revealed a powerful role for common environment (81.0%) compared with additive genetic heritability (14.5%).

1139,"Associations between implementation of Project Lazarus and opioid analgesic dispensing and buprenorphine utilization in North Carolina, 2009-2014 BACKGROUND: Project Lazarus (PL) is a seven-strategy, community-coalition-based intervention designed to reduce opioid overdose and dependence. The seven strategies include: community education, provider education, hospital emergency department policy change, diversion control, support programs for patients with pain, naloxone policies, and addiction treatment expansion. PL was originally developed in Wilkes County, NC. It was made available to all counties in North Carolina starting in March 2013 with funding of up to $34,400 per county per year. We examined the_association between PL implementation and 1) overall dispensing rate of opioid analgesics, and 2) utilization of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is often used in connection with medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid dependence. METHODS: Observational interrupted time series analysis of 100 counties over 2009-2014 (n_=_7200 county-months) in North Carolina. The intervention period was March 2013-December 2014. 74 of 100 counties implemented the intervention. Exposure data sources comprised process surveys, training records, Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data, and methadone treatment program quality data. Outcomes were PDMP-derived counts of opioid prescriptions and buprenorphine patients. Incidence Rate Ratios were estimated with adjusted GEE Poisson regression models of all seven PL strategies. RESULTS: In adjusted models, diversion control efforts were positively associated with increased dispensing of opioid analgesics (IRR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.09). None of the other PL strategies were associated with reduced prescribing of opioid analgesics. Support programs for patients with pain were associated with a non-significant decrease in buprenorphine utilization (IRR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.02), but addiction treatment expansion efforts were associated with no change in buprenorphine utilization (IRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.06). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of PL strategies did not appreciably reduce opioid dispensing and did not increase buprenorphine utilization. These results are consistent with previous findings of limited impact of PL strategies on overdose morbidity and mortality.

The predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic patients have not been well-described. METHODS: We conducted a time-to-event analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015. Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age, gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing. FINDINGS: Of 4.3 million patients receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48 per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70, 5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Opioid analgesic patients utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use, or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health records to include diagnosis information in analytic models.",,,5,,,
1141,"A statewide evaluation of seven strategies to reduce opioid overdose in North Carolina BACKGROUND: In response to increasing opioid overdoses, US prevention efforts have focused on prescriber education and supply, demand and harm reduction strategies. Limited evidence informs which interventions are effective. We evaluated Project Lazarus, a centralised statewide intervention designed to prevent opioid overdose. METHODS: Observational intervention study of seven strategies. 74 of 100 North Carolina counties implemented the intervention. Dichotomous variables were constructed for each strategy by county-month. Exposure data were: process logs, surveys, addiction treatment interviews, prescription drug monitoring data. Outcomes were: unintentional and undetermined opioid overdose deaths, overdose-related emergency department (ED) visits. Interrupted time-series Poisson regression was used to estimate rates during preintervention (2009-2012) and intervention periods (2013-2014). Adjusted IRR controlled for prescriptions, county health status and time trends. Time-lagged regression models considered delayed impact (0-6 months). RESULTS: In adjusted immediate-impact models, provider education was associated with lower overdose mortality (IRR 0.91; 95%__I 0.81 to 1.02) but little change in overdose-related ED visits. Policies to limit ED opioid dispensing were associated with lower mortality (IRR 0.97; 95%__I 0.87 to 1.07), but higher ED visits (IRR 1.06; 95%__I 1.01 to 1.12). Expansions of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) were associated with increased mortality (IRR 1.22; 95%__I 1.08 to 1.37) but lower ED visits in time-lagged models. CONCLUSIONS: Provider education related to pain management and addiction treatment, and ED policies limiting opioid dispensing showed modest immediate reductions in mortality. MAT expansions showed beneficial effects in reducing ED-related overdose visits in time-lagged models, despite an unexpected adverse association with mortality. _ Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

1144,"Diet and carbohydrate food knowledge of multi-ethnic women: a comparative analysis of pregnant women with and without Gestational Diabetes Mellitus BACKGROUND: Diet therapy is the cornerstone for the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Carbohydrate is the primary nutrient affecting postprandial blood glucose levels. Hence, knowledge of food containing carbohydrates can assist women with GDM optimize glycemic control. Despite that, there is a paucity of research on carbohydrate-related knowledge of women with GDM. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has one of the highest prevalence of diabetes (19.2%) in the world. This study compared diet and knowledge of carbohydrate-containing foods among pregnant women with and without GDM in the UAE. METHODS: The sample consisted of multi-ethnic women with GDM (n_=_94) and a control group of healthy pregnant women (n_=_90) attending prenatal clinics in three hospitals in Al Ain, UAE. Data were collected using a questionnaire and a 24-hour recall. Knowledge of food sources of carbohydrate, dietary patterns, and nutrient intakes of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the mean knowledge score of food sources of carbohydrate between women with GDM and that of pregnant women without GDM. Similarly, there were no significant differences in energy and nutrient intakes between the two groups with the exception of percent energy from protein. Women with GDM reported significantly lower intake of fruits and fruit juices (P_=_0.012) and higher consumption of milk and yogurt (P_=_0.004) compared to that of women without GDM. Twenty-two percent of women with GDM indicated they never visited a dietitian for counseling while 65% reported they visited a dietitian only once or twice during the pregnancy. Predictors of carbohydrate knowledge score were perceived knowledge of diet and GDM and parity among women with GDM and parity and educational level among those without GDM. CONCLUSION: The results of the study highlight the urgent need to provide nutrition education for women with GDM in the UAE.",,,6,,,
1145,"High proportion of 6 to 18-year-old children and adolescents in the United Arab Emirates are not meeting dietary recommendations In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), overweight, obesity, and associated chronic diseases have recently emerged as major public health concerns among all age groups, including children and adolescents. We hypothesized that although energy needs might be met by the majority of Emirati children and adolescents, their diet quality and intakes of certain micronutrients may not meet recommendations. A cross-sectional design was used to assess dietary intakes of 253 children (6-10 years of age) and 276 adolescents (11-18 years of age) in the UAE. Trained dietitians collected a 24-hour food recall in the homes of the participants. Nutrient intakes were compared with the Dietary Reference Intakes, and food group consumption was compared with MyPyramid recommendations. Results showed that 9 to 13-year-old females consumed 206 kcal/d from candy and sweets and nearly 264 cal/d from sugar-sweetened beverages. The proportion of participants with percentage energy from saturated fat greater than the recommendation ranged from 27.6% (males 9-13 years) to 45.9% (males 6-8 years). Mean intakes of vitamins A, D, and E were lower than the Estimated Average Requirements for all the subgroups. Mean calcium intake was lower than recommendations for all age and sex subgroups. The proportions of participants whose intakes were less than the recommended number of servings from the food groups were substantial: more than 90% of each of the 6 subgroups for the milk group and 100% among 9 to 18-year-old males for vegetables. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate the need for interventions targeting 6 to 18-year-old children and adolescents in the UAE to improve their diet quality. Copyright _ 2013.

1146,"Together Eating & Activity Matters (TEAM): results of a pilot randomized-clinical trial of a spousal support weight loss intervention for Black men Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, participation, preliminary efficacy and retention in a couples-based weight loss intervention among Black men. Design setting participants: Two-arm pilot randomized clinical trial in an academic clinical setting. Forty self-identified Black men and their female cohabitating partners (n_=_80) aged 18 to 65_years with body mass index from 25 to 45_kg/m2 were randomized using computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Intervention: Participants were randomized to a standard behavioural weight loss (Standard) programme or the Standard programme plus partner involvement (Enhanced). Both interventions focused on calorie reduction, physical activity and self-monitoring to facilitate weight loss. Enhanced included couples skills training and couple's communication components. Main outcome and measures: Changes in weight from baseline to 3_months among men. Partner weight loss (secondary). Results: Forty Black couples (men mean [SD] age, 47.4[11] years; body mass index, 35.0[6.1]), were recruited. Retention was 100% of the men and 98% of female partners. Attendance at group sessions was 63-73%. Between groups, mean (SD) weight changes among men were -3.4[.04] and -4.7[5.9] kg (p_=_0.57) and among women -0.23[4.46] and -2.47[3.62] kg (p_=_0.09), in the standard and enhanced groups. Conclusions: Weight losses from an intervention enhanced by partner involvement and an intervention with no partner involvement were not different. Treatment choice can be based on preference rather than outcome as both treatments are effective in producing clinically significant percent weight loss.Trial registration Clinical Trials NCT02458053.",,,6,,,
1147,"What is full capacity protocol, and how is it implemented successfully? BACKGROUND: Full capacity protocol (FCP) is an internationally recognized intervention designed to address emergency department (ED) crowding. Despite FCP international recognition and positive effects on hospital performance measures, many hospitals, even the most crowded ones, have not implemented FCP. We conducted this study to identify the core components of FCP, explore the key barriers and facilitators associated with the FCP implementation, and provide practical recommendations on how to overcome those barriers. METHODS: To identify the core components of FCP, we used a non-experimental approach. We conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants (e.g., division chiefs, medical directors) involved in the implementation of FCP. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide data collection and analysis. We used a template analysis approach to determine the relevance of the CFIR constructs to implementing the FCP. We analyzed the responses to the interview questions about FCP definition and FCP key principles, compared different hospitals' FCP official documents, and consulted with the original FCP developer. We then used an adaptation framework to categorize the core components of FCP into three main groups. Finally, we summarized practical recommendations for each barrier based on information provided by the interviewees. RESULTS: A total of 32 interviews were conducted. We observed that FCP has evolved from the idea of transferring boarded patients from ED hallways to inpatient hallways to a practical hospital-wide intervention with several components and multiple levels. The key determinant of successful FCP implementation was collaboration with inpatient nursing staff, as they were often reluctant to have patients boarded in inpatient hallways. Other determinants of successful FCP implementation were reaching consensus about the criteria for activation of each FCP level and actions in each FCP level, modifying the electronic health records system, restructuring the inpatient units to have adequate staffing and resources, complying with external regulations and policies such as fire marshal guidelines, and gaining hospital leaders' support. CONCLUSIONS: The key determinant in implementing FCP is creating a supportive and cooperative hospital culture and encouraging key stakeholders, including inpatient nursing staff, to acknowledge that crowding is a hospital-wide problem that requires a hospital-wide response.",,,7,,,
1148,"Association between adopting emergency department crowding interventions and emergency departments' core performance measures OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between adopting emergency department (ED) crowding interventions and emergency departments' core performance measures. METHODS: We analyzed the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) data from 2007 to 2015. The outcome variables are ED length of stay for discharged and admitted patients, boarding time, wait time and percentage of patients who left ED before being seen (LWBS). The independent variables are whether or not a hospital adopted each of the 20 crowding interventions. Controlling for patient-level, hospital level and temporal confounders we analyze and report results using multivariable logit model. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2015, NHAMCS collected data for 269,721 ED visit encounters, representing a nationwide of about 1.18 billion separate ED visits. Of 20 crowding interventions we tested, using adopting bedside registration (OR_=_0.89, 95% CI_=_0.75-0.98, P_< _.05), electronic dashboard (OR_=_0.86, 95% CI_=_0.76-0.98, P_< _.05), kiosk check-in technology (OR_=_0.56, 95% CI_=_0.41-0.83, P_< _.001), physician based triage (OR_=_0.86, 95% CI_=_0.73-0.99, P_< _.05) full capacity protocol (OR_=_0.91, 95% CI_=_0.79-0.99, P_< _.05) are associated with decrease in the odds of prolonged wait time.

1149,"Medical Care Costs of Breast Cancer in Privately Insured Women Aged 18-44 Years INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer in women aged 18-44 years accounts for approximately 27,000 newly diagnosed cases and 3,000 deaths annually. When tumors are diagnosed, they are usually aggressive, resulting in expensive treatment costs. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalent medical costs attributable to breast cancer treatment among privately insured younger women. METHODS: Data from the 2006 MarketScan database representing claims for privately insured younger women were used. Costs for younger breast cancer patients were compared with a matched sample of younger women without breast cancer, overall and for an active treatment subsample. Analyses were conducted in 2013 with medical care costs expressed in 2012 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: Younger women with breast cancer incurred an estimated $19,435 (SE=$415) in additional direct medical care costs per person per year compared with younger women without breast cancer. Outpatient expenditures comprised 94% of the total estimated costs ($18,344 [SE=$396]). Inpatient costs were $43 (SE=$10) higher and prescription drug costs were $1,048 (SE=$64) higher for younger women with breast cancer than in younger women without breast cancer. For women in active treatment, the burden was more than twice as high ($52,542 [SE=$977]). CONCLUSIONS: These estimates suggest that breast cancer is a costly illness to treat among younger, privately insured women. This underscores the potential financial vulnerability of women in this age group and the importance of health insurance during this time in life.

1150,"Breast cancer treatment costs in younger, privately insured women PURPOSE: Younger women (under age 45_years) diagnosed with breast cancer often face more aggressive tumors, higher treatment intensity, lower survival rates, and greater financial hardship. The purpose of this study was to estimate breast cancer costs by stage at diagnosis during the first 18_months of treatment for privately insured younger women. METHODS: We analyzed North Carolina cancer registry data linked to claims data from private insurers from 2003 to 2010. Breast cancer patients were split into two cohorts: a younger and older group aged 21-44 and 45-64_years, respectively. We conducted a cohort study and matched women with and without breast cancer using age, ZIP, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. We calculated mean excess costs between breast cancer and non-breast cancer patients at 6, 12, and 18_months. RESULTS: For younger women, AJCC 6th edition stage II cancer was the most common at diagnosis (40%), followed by stage I (34%). On the other hand, older women had more stage I (46%) cancer followed by stage II (34%). The excess costs for younger and older women at 12_months were $97,486 (95% confidence interval [CI] $93,631-101,341) and $75,737 (95% CI $73,962-77,512), respectively. Younger breast cancer patients had both a higher prevalence of later-stage disease and higher within-stage costs. CONCLUSIONS: The study reports high costs of treatment for both younger and older women than a non-cancer comparison group; however, the estimated excess cost was significantly higher for younger women. The financial implications of breast cancer treatment costs for younger women need to be explored in future studies.",,,3,,,
1151,"Measuring the impact of a continuing medical education program on patient blood pressure An increased focus on hypertension prevention and control, especially in high-risk populations, may have a substantial impact on cardiovascular health outcomes. A continuing medical education (CME) program trained primary care providers in evidence-based guidelines for hypertension prevention and control. This study evaluated its effectiveness in reducing patients' blood pressure for the sessions occurring from 2003 to 2007. Using the Hypertension Initiative Database, 8183 patients of CME providers (CME patients) were paired with controls and changes in blood pressure, provider visits, prescription months, and the proportion of patients with blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg before and after the intervention date were estimated. In the 2-year period before training and the 2-year period afterwards, CME patients' systolic blood pressure decreased by 1.99 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 1.49 mm Hg. The CME patients displayed an increase in provider visits but no statistically significant change in prescription months. Restricting the analysis to the subsample of patients with uncontrolled hypertension (>140/90 mm Hg), the changes in blood pressure were similar in magnitude to those in the entire population. The CME program, by promoting evidence-based practice, improves patients' blood pressure and could serve as a positive model for future hypertension interventions. _ 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,5,,,

1153,"Enhancing organizational capacity to provide cancer control programs among Latino churches: design and baseline findings of the CRUZA Study BACKGROUND: Faith-based organizations (FBOs) have been successful in delivering health promotion programs for African Americans, though few studies have been conducted among Latinos. Even fewer have focused on organizational change, which is required to sustain community-based initiatives. We hypothesized that FBOs serving Latinos would be more likely to offer evidence-based strategies (EBS) for cancer control after receiving a capacity enhancement intervention to implement health programs, and designed the CRUZA trial to test this hypothesis. This paper describes the CRUZA design and baseline findings. METHODS: We identified Catholic parishes in Massachusetts that provided Spanish-language mass (n = 65). A baseline survey assessed organizational characteristics relevant to adoption of health programs, including readiness for adoption, ""fit"" between innovation and organizational mission, implementation climate, and organizational culture. In the next study phase, parishes that completed the baseline assessment will be recruited to a randomized cluster trial, with the parish as the unit of analysis. Both groups will receive a Program Manual and Toolkit. Capacity Enhancement parishes will also be offered technical support, assistance forming health committees and building inter-institutional partnerships, and skills-based training. RESULTS: Of the 49 parishes surveyed at baseline (75%), one-third (33%) reported having provided at least one health program in the prior year. However, only two program offerings were cancer-specific. Nearly one-fifth (18%) had an active health ministry. There was a high level of organizational readiness to adopt cancer control programs, high congruence between parish missions and CRUZA objectives, moderately conducive implementation climates, and organizational cultures supportive of CRUZA programming. Having an existing health ministry was significantly associated with having offered health programs within the past year. Relationships between health program offerings and other organizational characteristics were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that many parishes do not offer cancer control programs, yet many may be ready to do so. However, the perceptions about existing organizational practices and policies may not be conducive to program initiation. A capacity enhancement intervention may hold promise as a means of increasing health programming. The efficacy of such an intervention will be tested in phase two of this study.",,,7,,,
1154,"Meausures of organizational characteristics associated with adoption and/or implementation of innovations: A systematic review BACKGROUND: This paper identifies and describes measures of constructs relevant to the adoption or implementation of innovations (i.e., new policies, programs or practices) at the organizational-level. This work is intended to advance the field of dissemination and implementation research by aiding scientists in the identification of existing measures and highlighting methodological issues that require additional attention. METHODS: We searched for published studies (1973-2013) in 11 bibliographic databases for quantitative, empirical studies that presented outcome data related to adoption and/or implementation of an innovation. Included studies had to assess latent constructs related to the ""inner setting"" of the organization, as defined by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: Of the 76 studies included, most (86%) were cross sectional and nearly half (49%) were conducted in health care settings. Nearly half (46%) involved implementation of evidence-based or ""best practice"" strategies; roughly a quarter (26%) examined use of new technologies. Primary outcomes most often assessed were innovation implementation (57%) and adoption (34%); while 4% of included studies assessed both outcomes. There was wide variability in conceptual and operational definitions of organizational constructs. The two most frequently assessed constructs included ""organizational climate"" and ""readiness for implementation."" More than half (55%) of the studies did not articulate an organizational theory or conceptual framework guiding the inquiry; about a third (34%) referenced Diffusion of Innovations theory. Overall, only 46% of articles reported psychometric properties of measures assessing latent organizational characteristics. Of these, 94% (33/35) described reliability and 71% (25/35) reported on validity. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of clarity associated with construct definitions, inconsistent use of theory, absence of standardized reporting criteria for implementation research, and the fact that few measures have demonstrated reliability or validity were among the limitations highlighted in our review. Given these findings, we recommend that increased attention be devoted toward the development or refinement of measures using common psychometric standards. In addition, there is a need for measure development and testing across diverse settings, among diverse population samples, and for a variety of types of innovations.",,,7,,,
1155,"Osteoarthritis physical activity care pathway (OA-PCP): results of a feasibility trial BACKGROUND: To obtain information on feasibility and acceptability, as well as preliminary data on efficacy, of an Osteoarthritis Physical activity Care Pathway (OA-PCP). METHODS: This was a single group pilot study involving 60 participants with symptomatic, physician diagnosed knee or hip OA, recruited from primary care clinics. Participants self-reported completing less than 150__in per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at baseline. The 3-month OA-PCP intervention involved 3 physical activity (PA) coaching calls (focused on goal setting), three check-in emails and linkage with community-based or online resources to support PA. Efficacy outcomes were collected at baseline and 4-month follow-up. The primary efficacy outcome was minutes of MVPA, assessed via accelerometer. Secondary outcomes included minutes of light intensity activity, sedentary minutes, step counts, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain and function subscales. Participants were also asked to rate the helpfulness of the OA-PCP intervention on a scale of 0-10. Differences in efficacy outcomes between baseline and 4-month follow-up were assessed using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Among participants beginning the study, 88% completed follow-up assessments and____90% completed each of the intervention calls. Average daily minutes of MVPA was 8.0 at baseline (standard deviation (SD)_=_9.9) and 8.9 at follow-up (SD_=_12.1, p_=_0.515). There were no statistically significant changes in light intensity activity, sedentary time or step counts. The mean WOMAC pain score improved from 8.1 (SD_=_3.6) at baseline to 6.2 (SD_=_3.8) at follow-up (p_< _0.001); the mean WOMAC function score improved from 26.2 (SD_=_13.2) to 20.2 (SD_=_12.5; p_< _0.001). The mean rating of helpfulness was 7.6 (SD_=_2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of the study, and participants reported clinically relevant improvements in pain and function. PA metrics did not improve substantially. Based on these results and participant feedback, modifications including enhanced self-monitoring are being made to increase the impact of the OA-PCP intervention on PA behavior.

1157,"Associations of occupational tasks with knee and hip osteoarthritis: the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study examined associations of occupational tasks with radiographic and symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) in a community-based sample. METHODS: Participants from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (n = 2729) self-reported the frequency of performing 10 specific occupational tasks at the longest job ever held (never/seldom/sometimes vs often/always) and lifetime exposure to jobs that required spending > 50% of their time doing 5 specific tasks or lifting 22, 44, or 110 pounds 10 times weekly. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of each occupational task separately with radiographic and symptomatic knee and hip OA, controlling for age, race, gender, body mass index, prior knee or hip injury, and smoking. RESULTS: Radiographic hip and knee OA were not significantly associated with any occupational tasks, but several occupational tasks were associated with increased odds of both symptomatic knee and hip OA: lifting > 10 pounds, crawling, and doing heavy work while standing (OR 1.4-2.1). More occupational walking and standing and less sitting were also associated with symptomatic knee OA, and more bending/twisting/reaching was associated with symptomatic hip OA. Exposure to a greater number of physically demanding occupational tasks at the longest job was associated with greater odds of both symptomatic knee and hip OA. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm an association of physically demanding occupational tasks with both symptomatic knee and hip OA, including several specific activities that increased the odds of OA in both joint groups. These tasks represent possibilities for identifying and targeting at-risk individuals with preventive interventions.",,,9,,,
1158,"Racial differences in knee osteoarthritis pain: potential contribution of occupational and household tasks OBJECTIVE: We examined whether occupational and household tasks contributed to differences in pain between African Americans and whites with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Participants from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project self-reported the frequency (often/always vs never/seldom/sometimes) of performing 9 occupational tasks involving lower extremity joint loading at their longest job (N = 868) and current job (N = 273), as well as 8 household tasks ever performed (N = 811) and currently being performed (N = 767). The associations of the numbers of occupational or household tasks with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale were first examined in simple linear regression models. If significantly associated with greater pain, each of these was included in adjusted linear regression models to examine whether the association of race with pain remained statistically significant. RESULTS: African Americans reported significantly greater WOMAC pain scores than whites. Exposures to more occupational tasks at the longest job and the current job were associated with greater WOMAC pain scores (p < 0.01). The association of race with greater pain scores remained statistically significant when controlling for occupational tasks at the longest job, but was reduced by 26% and no longer significant when controlling for the number of current occupational tasks. Exposures to an increasing number of household tasks were associated with lower pain scores and were not further analyzed. CONCLUSION: Current performance of physically demanding occupational tasks contributed to racial differences in pain severity among individuals with knee OA. Better workplace policies to accommodate OA-related limitations may help to reduce racial differences in pain.",,,9,,,
1159,"Comparison of pain measures among patients with osteoarthritis UNLABELLED: This study compared recalled average pain, assessed at the end of the day, with the average of real-time pain ratings recorded throughout the day among patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Participants (N = 157) with hand, hip, or knee OA completed electronic pain diaries on 1 weekend day and 1 weekday. Diaries included at least 7 pain ratings per day, immediately after waking and every 2 hours following, using a visual analog scale (VAS) scored as 1 to 100 (scores not seen by participants). At the end of each diary day, participants rated their average pain that day on the same VAS. Pearson correlations examined associations between recalled average pain and the average of real-time pain ratings that day. Mixed models, including interaction terms, examined whether associations between recalled and actual average pain ratings differed according to the following patient characteristics: joint site, age, race, gender, study enrollment site, and pain catastrophizing. Correlations between recalled and actual average pain ratings were r = .88 for weekdays and r = .86 for weekends (P < .0001). In mixed models, there were no significant interaction terms for any patient characteristics. In summary, patients with OA accurately recalled their average pain over a 1-day period, and this did not differ according to any patient characteristics examined. PERSPECTIVE: This study showed that patients with OA accurately recalled their average pain over a single-day period, and this did not differ according to patient characteristics. Results of this study indicate that end-of-day recall is a practical and valid method for assessing patients' average pain during a day. Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,9,,,
1160,"State of the evidence PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on recent studies of osteoarthritis epidemiology, including research on prevalence, incidence, and a broad array of potential risk factors at the person level and joint level. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies continue to illustrate the high impact of osteoarthritis worldwide, with increasing incidence. Person-level risk factors with strong evidence regarding osteoarthritis incidence and/or progression include age, sex, socioeconomic status, family history, and obesity. Joint-level risk factors with strong evidence for incident osteoarthritis risk include injury and occupational joint loading; the associations of injury and joint alignment with osteoarthritis progression are compelling. Moderate levels of physical activity have not been linked to increased osteoarthritis risk. Some topics of high recent interest or emerging evidence for association with osteoarthritis include metabolic pathways, vitamins, joint shape, bone density, limb length inequality, muscle strength and mass, and early structural damage. SUMMARY: Osteoarthritis is a complex, multifactorial disease, and there is still much to learn regarding mechanisms underlying incidence and progression. However, there are several known modifiable and preventable risk factors, including obesity and joint injury; efforts to mitigate these risks can help to lessen the impact of osteoarthritis.",,,9,,,
1161,"Race and sex differences in willingness to undergo total joint replacement: the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project OBJECTIVE: Using data from the community-based Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project, we examined race and sex variations in willingness to undergo, and perceptions regarding, total joint replacement (TJR). METHODS: Analyses were conducted for the total sample who participated in a followup measurement period from 2006-2010 (n = 1,522) and a subsample with symptomatic hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (sOA; n = 445). Participants indicated how willing they would be to have TJR (hip or knee) if their doctor recommended it; responses were categorized as ""definitely"" or ""probably"" willing versus ""unsure,"" ""probably not,"" or ""definitely not"" willing, or ""don't know."" Participants answered 7 questions regarding perceptions of TJR outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression models of willingness included participant characteristics (including socioeconomic status) and TJR perception variables that were associated with willingness at the P < 0.1 level in bivariate analyses. RESULTS: African Americans had lower odds of willingness to undergo TJR than whites in the total sample (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.47 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.31-0.72]) and the sOA subsample (adjusted OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.25-0.69]). There were no sex differences in willingness. African Americans expected poorer TJR outcomes than whites, but sex differences were minimal; perceptions of TJR outcomes were not significantly associated with willingness. CONCLUSION: In this community sample, race differences in TJR willingness and perceptions were substantial, but sex differences were small. Perceptions of TJR did not appear to affect willingness or explain race differences in willingness. Copyright _ 2014 by the American College of Rheumatology.",,,9,,,
1162,"Performance of global assessments of hip, knee, and back symptom change The objective of this study is to compare patients' global assessments of change in knee, hip, and back symptoms with actual changes over time in pain, function, and radiographic severity. The participants (n_=_894, 80% female, mean age_=_66_years) completed two assessments (mean of 4_years apart) as part of a study on the genetics of generalized osteoarthritis. At both assessments, participants completed the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC), and radiographic severity was assessed for knees, hips, and low back. At the second assessment, participants described changes in knee, hip, and low back symptoms as worse, better, same, or never had symptoms. Analysis of covariance models examined mean changes in WOMAC scores and radiographic severity according to categories of the global assessment measures. Statistical significance was examined for linear trend. Mean WOMAC total, pain, and function scores decreased (indicating improvement) among participants who indicated joint symptoms were better, showed little change among those who reported symptoms were the same/never had symptoms, and increased among those who reported symptoms were worse. For all analyses except the comparison of WOMAC pain change according to global assessment of low back symptom change, there was a statistically significant linear trend (p_< _0.05). Patterns were similar for changes in radiographic severity, but the tests of linear trend were not statistically significant. Results support the concordance of these global assessments of joint symptom change with actual changes in self-reported symptoms. These global assessments may be useful for assessing change over time when baseline data are unavailable.",,,9,,,
1163,"Telephone-based self-management of osteoarthritis: A randomized trial BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of pain and disability, and self-management behaviors for osteoarthritis are underutilized. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of a telephone-based self-management intervention for hip or knee osteoarthritis in a primary care setting. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial with equal assignment to osteoarthritis self-management, health education (attention control), and usual care control groups. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00288912) SETTING: Primary care clinics in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PATIENTS: 515 patients with symptomatic hip or knee osteoarthritis. INTERVENTION: The osteoarthritis self-management intervention involved educational materials and 12 monthly telephone calls to support individualized goals and action plans. The health education intervention involved nonosteoarthritis educational materials and 12 monthly telephone calls related to general health screening topics. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was score on the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales-2 pain subscale (range, 0 to 10). Pain was also assessed with a 10-cm visual analog scale. Measurements were collected at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: 461 participants (90%) completed the 12-month assessment. The mean Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales-2 pain score in the osteoarthritis self-management group was 0.4 point lower (95% CI, -0.8 to 0.1 point; P = 0.105) than in the usual care group and 0.6 point lower (CI, -1.0 to -0.2 point; P = 0.007) than in the health education group at 12 months. The mean visual analog scale pain score in the osteoarthritis self-management group was 1.1 points lower (CI, -1.6 to -0.6 point; P < 0.001) than in the usual care group and 1.0 point lower (CI, -1.5 to -0.5 point; P < 0.001) than in the health education group. Health care use did not differ across the groups. LIMITATION: The study was conducted at 1 Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and the sample consisted primarily of men. CONCLUSION: A telephone-based osteoarthritis self-management program produced moderate improvements in pain, particularly compared with a health education control group.

1164,"Antiretroviral therapy provided to HIV-infected Malawian women in a randomized trial diminishes the positive effects of lipid-based nutrient supplements on breast-milk B vitamins BACKGROUND: Little information is available on B vitamin concentrations in human milk or on how they are affected by maternal B vitamin deficiencies, antiretroviral therapy, or maternal supplementation. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effects of antiretroviral therapy and/or lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) on B vitamin concentrations in breast milk from HIV-infected women in Malawi. DESIGN: Breast milk was collected from 537 women recruited within the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition study at 2 or 6 wk and 24 wk postpartum. Women were assigned to receive antiretrovirals and LNSs, antiretrovirals only, LNSs only, or a control. Antiretrovirals and LNSs were given to the mothers from weeks 0 to 28. The antiretrovirals were zidovudine/lamivudine and nelfinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. LNSs provided 93-118% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, and vitamin B-12. Infants were exclusively breastfed. RESULTS: LNSs increased milk concentrations of all vitamins except thiamin, whereas antiretrovirals lowered concentrations of nicotinamide, pyridoxal, and vitamin B-12. Although antiretrovirals alone had no significant effect on riboflavin concentrations, they negatively affected the LNS-induced increase in this vitamin. Thiamin was not influenced by the study interventions. Concentrations of all B vitamins were much lower than usually accepted values. CONCLUSIONS: All B vitamins were low in milk, and all but thiamin were increased by maternal supplementation with LNSs. Antiretrovirals alone decreased concentrations of some B vitamins in milk. When LNS was given in addition to antiretrovirals, the negative effect of antiretrovirals offset the positive effect of LNSs for all vitamins except thiamin.

1165,"Reducing cardiovascular disease in a rural community In this case report, we describe the one-year formative phase of a five-year study to develop, implement, and test a community health worker (CHW)-delivered cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention intervention. The purpose of the formative phase was to engage community partners in the adaptation of an existing evidence-based CVD prevention intervention to fit the needs and preferences of a rural, predominantly African-American community. The formative work was guided by a framework for adapting evidence-based interventions and involved engaging stakeholders in assessing the intervention's fit with the local context and then applying assessment findings to iteratively adapt the intervention's contents, materials, and delivery methods. Findings from the formative work were then applied to develop CHW position descriptions, workflow diagrams, and a training plan. Findings also were applied to adapt intervention materials and protocols to fit the needs of the community. This case report illustrates how community-engaged formative work can be applied to adapt an evidence-based intervention to fit community needs and resources. _ 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,1,,,
1166,"Evaluating the implementation of peer counseling in a church-based dietary intervention for African Americans OBJECTIVE: Body & Soul, an evidence-based nutrition program for African Americans churches, is currently being disseminated nationally and free of charge by the National Cancer Institute. For dissemination feasibility, the peer counseling training is done via DVD rather than by live trainers. We describe implementation and process evaluation of the peer counseling component under real world conditions. METHODS: The study sample included 11 churches (6 early intervention, 5 delayed intervention) in 6 states. Data sources included training observations, post-training debriefing sessions, coordinator interviews, and church participant surveys. Survey data analysis examined associations between exposure to peer counseling and change in dietary intake. Qualitative data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Eight of 11 churches initiated the peer counseling program. Recall of talking with a peer counselor was associated with significantly (p< .02) greater fruit and vegetable intake. Data indicate sub-optimal program execution after peer counselor training. CONCLUSION: Inconsistent implementation of the peer counseling intervention is likely to dilute program effectiveness in changing nutrition behaviors. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Disseminating evidence-based programs may require added resources, training, quality control, and technical assistance for improving program uptake. Similar to earlier research phases, systematic efforts at the dissemination phase are needed for program success. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,4,,,
1167,"Evaluating the dissemination of Body & Soul, an evidence-based fruit and vegetable intake intervention: challenges for dissemination and implementation research OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the evidence-based Body & Soul program, when disseminated and implemented without researcher or agency involvement and support, would achieve results similar to those of earlier efficacy and effectiveness trials. DESIGN: Prospective group randomized trial. SETTING: Churches with predominantly African American membership. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,033 members from the 15 churches completed baseline surveys. Of these participants, 562 (54.4%) completed the follow-up survey 6 months later. INTERVENTION: Church-based nutrition program for African Americans that included pastoral involvement, educational activities, church environmental changes, and peer counseling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Daily fruit and vegetable (FV) intake was assessed at pre- and posttest. ANALYSIS: Mixed-effects linear models. RESULTS: At posttest, there was no statistically significant difference in daily servings of FVs between the early intervention group participants compared to control group participants (4.7 vs 4.4, P = .38). Process evaluation suggested that added resources such as technical assistance could improve program implementation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The disseminated program may not produce improvements in FV intake equal to those in the earlier efficacy and effectiveness trials, primarily because of a lack of program implementation. Program dissemination may not achieve public health impact unless support systems are strengthened for adequate implementation at the church level.

1168,"African American women's perspectives on breast cancer: implications for communicating risk of basal-like breast cancer African American women suffer a disproportionately high burden of basal-like breast cancer, an aggressive subtype that has no targeted therapy. While epidemiologic research has identified key prevention strategies, little is known about how best to communicate risk to this population. This study explored women's knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about breast cancer to learn about risk perceptions. Six focus groups were conducted in North Carolina with 57 women (ages 18-49). Age, race (especially perceptions of cancer as a ""White disease""), and lack of family history of breast cancer were all shown to contribute to women's perceptions of low breast cancer susceptibility. Perceptions of low risk were also attributed to conflicting risk information from family, media, and health providers. Women had little to no knowledge of breast cancer subtypes, and emphasized that health communications should be personally relevant, culturally appropriate, and convenient. These findings will assist in developing health communication tools that encourage prevention.",,,3,,,
1169,"Peer Connect for African American breast cancer survivors and caregivers: a train-the-trainer approach for peer support Racial disparities in breast cancer survivorship are a major concern nationally. How survivors cope with cancer and re-frame their lives is a critical part of survivorship. Community-academic research partnerships may facilitate access to much-needed psychosocial support for African American survivors and caregivers in rural areas, but drivers of successful intervention implementation are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to describe the training and evaluation of Community Coaches and Guides (i.e., peer supporters) using the Peer Connect program for African American breast cancer survivors and caregivers. Community engagement strategies were used to implement the training component of Peer Connect, an evidence-based program grounded in the Diffusion of Innovation Theory utilizing motivational interviewing techniques (MI) and a ""train-the-trainer"" model. Quantitative and qualitative methods examined implementation outcomes of feasibility, MI fidelity, and acceptability-precursor outcomes that must be achieved before examining intervention impact vis-_-vis changes in support care. Training was feasible to implement and replicable by the trained Community Coaches. Beyond feasibility and replicability, success was modest regarding MI fidelity. Benefits (e.g., serving as role models and having safe sources of support) and lessons learned (e.g., need for additional quality control) were identified as both facilitators and barriers to implementation and as factors that could impact the effectiveness of community-engaged programs to improve survivorship outcomes. Peer Connect, like other programs that employ community-engagement strategies, holds promise to meet the psychosocial support needs of diverse rural cancer survivor populations.",,,3,,,
1170,"Pilot weight control intervention among US veterans to promote diets high in fruits and vegetables BACKGROUND: Obesity is a significant problem among US veterans. Diets high in fruits and vegetables (FV) can lower obesity risk. Health communication interventions are promising strategies for promoting healthy eating. We evaluated whether an enhanced intervention with tailored newsletters and motivational interviewing calls would be more effective than the Veterans Affairs (VA) weight management program, MOVE!, at increasing FV intake among overweight/obese veterans. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design, 195 veterans at two clinics participated at baseline and 6-month follow-up from 2005 to 2006. Measures included daily FV intake and information processing of the intervention. The control group (MOVE!) received educational information, group sessions, and standard phone calls about weight. The intervention included MOVE! components plus tailored newsletters and motivational interviewing calls. RESULTS: The intervention group reported a statistically significant increase in FV servings compared to control (1.7 vs. 1.2; p _ 0.05). Veterans who read more of the tailored newsletters (_=0.15, p=0.01) and perceived the messages as important (_=0.12, p< 0.01) and applicable to their lives (_=0.12, p< 0.01) ate more FV than those who did not. However, receiving MI calls and information processing regarding the calls were not associated with FV intake. CONCLUSION: A tailored intervention can impact short term FV intake for obesity prevention. Copyright _ 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,4,,,
1171,"Cuban Americans have the highest rates of peripheral arterial disease in diverse Hispanic/Latino communities OBJECTIVE: Because Hispanic ethnicity in the United States is heterogeneous, the purpose of this study was to determine the epidemiology of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) within U.S. Hispanic/Latino groups defined by national background. METHODS: This analysis included 9648 men and women older than 45 years enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was computed as the higher of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis systolic blood pressures for each leg divided by the higher brachial artery systolic blood pressure. The index ABI was the higher of the two. An ABI _0.90 was the criterion for the presence of PAD. RESULTS: The mean age was 56 years, and 55% were female. Overall, the prevalence of an ABI _0.90 (PAD), 0.90 to 0.99 (borderline), 1.0 to 1.39 (normal), and _1.40 (high) was 5.7%, 19.3%, 72.5%, and 2.6%, respectively. After multivariable adjustment for PAD risk factors and compared with Mexicans, Cubans had a nearly threefold higher odds for PAD (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.4). The odds of PAD for the other Hispanic/Latino groups ranged from 1.2 to 1.8. Although men had a more than threefold higher odds of an ABI _1.40 (3.6; 2.0-6.5), the odds did not differ significantly by Hispanic/Latino background. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Mexican Americans, all other Hispanic/Latino background groups have a significantly higher odds of having PAD, with the odds being nearly threefold higher among Cubans.

1172,"Saturated fat intake and prostate cancer aggressiveness: results from the population-based North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence supports a role for cholesterol in prostate cancer (PC). Dietary saturated fat content impacts serum cholesterol levels. However, epidemiologic associations between saturated fat and PC aggressiveness are inconsistent. We hypothesized that high saturated fat intake would be associated with increased PC aggressiveness, and that statin use would modify this association. METHODS: Of 1854 PC cases in the North Carolina-Louisiana PC Project, 321 (17%) were classified as high aggressive (Gleason sum _8, PSA>20__g__l-1, or Gleason sum _7 and clinical stage T3-4) or low/intermediate aggressive (all other cases). Using low/intermediate aggressive cases as the referent group, we examined the association between tertiles of total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake and high aggressive PC using logistic regression, overall and stratified by race and statin use. We examined total fat-adjusted polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA and MUFA, respectively), trans fat and cholesterol intake in secondary analysis. RESULTS: High total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake was associated with an elevated odds ratio (OR) for aggressive PC (ORT3vsT1 1.51; 95% CI 1.10-2.06; P-trend=0.009), with an attenuated association in statin users (ORT3vsT1 1.16; 95% CI 0.67-2.01; P-trend=0.661) compared with non-users (ORT3vsT1 1.71; 95% CI 1.16-2.51; P-trend=0.053). High total fat-adjusted cholesterol intake was associated with aggressive PC in European Americans (ORT3vsT1 1.62; 95% CI 1.02-2.58; P-trend=0.056), but not African Americans (ORT3vsT1 0.92; 95% CI 0.60-1.42; P-trend=0.750). High total fat-adjusted PUFA was inversely associated with PC aggressiveness (ORT3vsT1 0.75; 95% CI 0.55-1.03), although this was not significant. No associations were found between total fat-adjusted MUFA or trans fat and PC aggressiveness. CONCLUSIONS: High total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake was associated with increased PC aggressiveness, with a suggestion of a stronger effect in men not using statins. The association between total fat-adjusted cholesterol intake and PC aggressiveness was most pronounced in European Americans.",,,4,,,
1173,"Performance of Three-Biomarker Immunohistochemistry for Intrinsic Breast Cancer Subtyping in the AMBER Consortium BACKGROUND: Classification of breast cancer into intrinsic subtypes has clinical and epidemiologic importance. To examine accuracy of IHC-based methods for identifying intrinsic subtypes, a three-biomarker IHC panel was compared with the clinical record and RNA-based intrinsic (PAM50) subtypes. METHODS: Automated scoring of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 was performed on IHC-stained tissue microarrays comprising 1,920 cases from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) consortium. Multiple cores (1-6/case) were collapsed to classify cases, and automated scoring was compared with the clinical record and to RNA-based subtyping. RESULTS: Automated analysis of the three-biomarker IHC panel produced high agreement with the clinical record (93% for ER and HER2, and 88% for PR). Cases with low tumor cellularity and smaller core size had reduced agreement with the clinical record. IHC-based definitions had high agreement with the clinical record regardless of hormone receptor positivity threshold (1% vs. 10%), but a 10% threshold produced highest agreement with RNA-based intrinsic subtypes. Using a 10% threshold, IHC-based definitions identified the basal-like intrinsic subtype with high sensitivity (86%), although sensitivity was lower for luminal A, luminal B, and HER2-enriched subtypes (76%, 40%, and 37%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Three-biomarker IHC-based subtyping has reasonable accuracy for distinguishing basal-like from nonbasal-like, although additional biomarkers are required for accurate classification of luminal A, luminal B, and HER2-enriched cancers. IMPACT: Epidemiologic studies relying on three-biomarker IHC status for subtype classification should use caution when distinguishing luminal A from luminal B and when interpreting findings for HER2-enriched cancers. _2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",,,3,,,
1174,"Statin Use and Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness: Results from the Population-Based North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project BACKGROUND: Although statin use has been associated with reduced prostate cancer aggressiveness, the impact of race and patient characteristics on this association is not well understood. We examined the association between statin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness in Caucasians (CA) and African Americans (AA) and explored effect modification by health-seeking behaviors associated with statin use. METHODS: Of 1,930 cases from The North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project, 344 (18%) were classified as aggressive based on clinical criteria. Utilizing nonaggressive cases as referent, logistic regression was used to examine the association between statin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness, overall and stratified by race. Smoking and prostate cancer screening were examined as effect modifiers of this association. RESULTS: There was an inverse association between statin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness [OR, 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.96], with comparable effect estimates in both races. Although not statistically significant, statin use was associated with reduced ORs for aggressive prostate cancer in never-screened men (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.45-1.39), men screened at low/recommended frequency (_once/year; OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41-1.06), and men screened at high frequency (>once/year; OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53-1.15). Inverse associations between statins and aggressive prostate cancer were strongest in never smokers (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25-0.72), attenuated in former smokers (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59-1.19), and absent in current smokers (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.70-2.64). CONCLUSIONS: Statin use was associated with reduced prostate cancer aggressiveness in CA and AAs, with strongest inverse associations in nonsmokers. IMPACT: Health-seeking behaviors associated with statin use should be considered when examining the impact of statins on prostate cancer aggressiveness.

1175,"Statin use, high cholesterol and prostate cancer progression; results from HCaP-NC BACKGROUND: Statin use is associated with lower advanced prostate cancer risk and reduced prostate cancer-specific mortality, but prior studies were conducted mainly in white men. We examined the effect of statin use on risk of prostate cancer progression in a population-based, minority-enriched cohort. METHODS: We used data from prostate cancer cases (45% African American) diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 who participated in the Health Care Access and Prostate Cancer Treatment in North Carolina cohort (HCaP-NC). We abstracted statin use at diagnosis. Men reported if they had ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine associations between statin use and risk of prostate cancer progression (biochemical recurrence or secondary treatment), overall and by race. In secondary analysis, we examined the association between high cholesterol and risk of progression, overall, and by statin use. RESULTS: Of 669 men, 244 (36%) were statin users at diagnosis. During 3.8 years median follow-up, 138 men experienced prostate cancer progression. There was no association between statin use and risk of progression, either overall (HR 1.03; 95%CI 0.72-1.46) or stratified by race. High cholesterol was inversely associated with risk of progression, particularly among statin users (HR 0.43; 95%CI 0.20-0.94; p-interaction_=_0.22) and in men with higher perceived access to care (HR 0.57; 95%CI 0.36-0.90; p-interaction_=_0.03). Study limitations included a relatively small sample size, short follow-up, and lack of data regarding post diagnosis statin use. CONCLUSIONS: Statin use at diagnosis was not associated with prostate cancer progression in the population-based, minority-enriched HCaP-NC. Greater healthcare engagement, including actively controlling serum cholesterol, may be linked to better prostate cancer-specific outcomes. _ 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,
1176,"Frequency of breast cancer subtypes among African American women in the AMBER consortium BACKGROUND: Breast cancer subtype can be classified using standard clinical markers (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)), supplemented with additional markers. However, automated biomarker scoring and classification schemes have not been standardized. The aim of this study was to optimize tumor classification using automated methods in order to describe subtype frequency in the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) consortium. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we quantified the expression of ER, PR, HER2, the proliferation marker Ki67, and two basal-like biomarkers, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytokeratin (CK)5/6, in 1381 invasive breast tumors from African American women. RNA-based (prediction analysis of microarray 50 (PAM50)) subtype, available for 574 (42%) cases, was used to optimize classification. Subtype frequency was calculated, and associations between subtype and tumor characteristics were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Relative to ER, PR and HER2 from medical records, central IHC staining and the addition of Ki67 or combined tumor grade improved accuracy for classifying PAM50-based luminal subtypes. Few triple negative cases (< _2%) lacked EGFR and CK5/6 expression, thereby providing little improvement in accuracy for identifying basal-like tumors. Relative to luminal A subtype, all other subtypes had higher combined grade and were larger, and ER-/HER2+ tumors were more often lymph node positive and late stage tumors. The frequency of basal-like tumors was 31%, exceeded only slightly by luminal A tumors (37%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that automated IHC-based classification produces tumor subtype frequencies approximating those from PAM50-based classification and highlight high frequency of basal-like and low frequency of luminal A breast cancer in a large study of African American women.",,,3,,,
1177,"Intratumoral heterogeneity as a source of discordance in breast cancer biomarker classification BACKGROUND: Spatial heterogeneity in biomarker expression may impact breast cancer classification. The aims of this study were to estimate the frequency of spatial heterogeneity in biomarker expression within tumors, to identify technical and biological factors contributing to spatial heterogeneity, and to examine the impact of discordant biomarker status within tumors on clinical record agreement. METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using two to four cores (1.0_mm) for each of 1085 invasive breast cancers from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, which is part of the AMBER Consortium. Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was quantified using automated digital imaging analysis. The biomarker status for each core and for each case was assigned using clinical thresholds. Cases with core-to-core biomarker discordance were manually reviewed to distinguish intratumoral biomarker heterogeneity from misclassification of biomarker status by the automated algorithm. The impact of core-to-core biomarker discordance on case-level agreement between TMAs and the clinical record was evaluated. RESULTS: On the basis of automated analysis, discordant biomarker status between TMA cores occurred in 9_%, 16_%, and 18_% of cases for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. Misclassification of benign epithelium and/or ductal carcinoma in situ as invasive carcinoma by the automated algorithm was implicated in discordance among cores. However, manual review of discordant cases confirmed spatial heterogeneity as a source of discordant biomarker status between cores in 2_%, 7_%, and 8_% of cases for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. Overall, agreement between TMA and clinical record was high for ER (94_%), PR (89_%), and HER2 (88_%), but it was reduced in cases with core-to-core discordance (agreement 70_% for ER, 61_% for PR, and 57_% for HER2). CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral biomarker heterogeneity may impact breast cancer classification accuracy, with implications for clinical management. Both manually confirmed biomarker heterogeneity and misclassification of biomarker status by automated image analysis contribute to discordant biomarker status between TMA cores. Given that manually confirmed heterogeneity is uncommon (< 10_% of cases), large studies are needed to study the impact of heterogeneous biomarker expression on breast cancer classification and outcomes.",,,3,,,
1178,"Impact of carbohydrate restriction in the context of obesity on prostate tumor growth in the Hi-Myc transgenic mouse model BACKGROUND: Previously, we showed that carbohydrate restriction with calorie restriction slowed tumor growth in xenograft mouse prostate cancer models. Herein, we examined the impact of carbohydrate restriction without calorie restriction on tumor development within the context of diet-induced obesity in the Hi-Myc transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer. METHODS: Mice were randomized at 5 weeks of age to ad libitum western diet (WD; 40% fat, 42% carbohydrate; n=39) or ad libitum no carbohydrate ketogenic diet (NCKD; 82% fat, 1% carbohydrate; n=44). At age 3 or 6 months, mice were killed, prostates weighed and prostate histology, proliferation, apoptosis and macrophage infiltration evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin, Ki67, TUNEL and F4/80 staining, respectively. Body composition was assessed by DEXA, serum cytokines measured using multiplex, and Akt/mTOR signaling assessed by Western. RESULTS: Caloric intake was higher in the NCKD group, resulting in elevated body weights at 6 months of age, relative to the WD group (45__ vs 38g; P=0.008). Despite elevated body weights, serum monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-1_ levels were lower in NCKD versus WD mice (P=0.046 and P=0.118, respectively), and macrophage infiltration was reduced in prostates of NCKD versus WD mice (P=0.028). Relative Akt phosphorylation and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein levels were reduced in prostates of NCKD versus WD mice. However, while mice randomized to NCKD had smaller prostates after adjustment for body weight at 3 and 6 months (P=0.004 and P=0.002, respectively), NCKD mice had higher rates of adenocarcinoma at 6 months compared to WD mice (100 vs 80%, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher caloric intake and elevated body weights, carbohydrate restriction lowered serum MCP-1 levels, reduced prostate macrophage infiltration, reduced prostate weight, but failed to slow adenocarcinoma development. Together, these data suggest that although carbohydrate restriction within the context of obesity may reduce obesity-associated systemic inflammation and perhaps slow tumor growth, it is not sufficient to counteract obesity-associated tumor development.",,,3,,,
1179,"Bimodal age distribution at diagnosis in breast cancer persists across molecular and genomic classifications PURPOSE: Female breast cancer demonstrates bimodal age frequency distribution patterns at diagnosis, interpretable as two main etiologic subtypes or groupings of tumors with shared risk factors. While RNA-based methods including PAM50 have identified well-established clinical subtypes, age distribution patterns at diagnosis as a proxy for etiologic subtype are not established for molecular and genomic tumor classifications. METHODS: We evaluated smoothed age frequency distributions at diagnosis for Carolina Breast Cancer Study cases within immunohistochemistry-based and RNA-based expression categories. Akaike information criterion (AIC) values compared the fit of single density versus two-component mixture models. Two-component mixture models estimated the proportion of early-onset and late-onset categories by immunohistochemistry-based ER (n_=_2860), and by RNA-based ESR1 and PAM50 subtype (n_=_1965). PAM50 findings were validated using pooled publicly available data (n_=_8103). RESULTS: Breast cancers were best characterized by bimodal age distribution at diagnosis with incidence peaks near 45 and 65_years, regardless of molecular characteristics. However, proportional composition of early-onset and late-onset age distributions varied by molecular and genomic characteristics. Higher ER-protein and ESR1-RNA categories showed a greater proportion of late age-at-onset. Similarly, PAM50 subtypes showed a shifting age-at-onset distribution, with most pronounced early-onset and late-onset peaks found in Basal-like and Luminal A, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Bimodal age distribution at diagnosis was detected in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, similar to national cancer registry data. Our data support two fundamental age-defined etiologic breast cancer subtypes that persist across molecular and genomic characteristics. Better criteria to distinguish etiologic subtypes could improve understanding of breast cancer etiology and contribute to prevention efforts.",,,3,,,
1180,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, hormone receptor status, and breast cancer-specific mortality in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study Epidemiologic studies report a protective association between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer risk, a finding consistent with NSAID-mediated suppression of aromatase-driven estrogen biosynthesis. However, the association between NSAID use and breast cancer-specific mortality is uncertain and it is unknown whether this relationship differs by hormone receptor status. This study comprised 935 invasive breast cancer cases, of which 490 were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, enrolled between 1996 and 2001 in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study. Self-reported NSAID use in the decade prior to diagnosis was categorized by duration and regularity of use. Differences in tumor size, stage, node, and receptor status by NSAID use were examined using Chi-square tests. Associations between NSAID use and breast cancer-specific mortality were examined using age- and race-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis. Tumor characteristics did not differ by NSAID use. Increased duration and regularity of NSAID use was associated with reduced breast cancer-specific mortality in women with ER-positive tumors (long-term regular use (_8_days/month for___3_years) versus no use; hazard ratio (HR) 0.48; 95_% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.98), with a statistically significant trend with increasing duration and regularity (p-trend_=_0.036). There was no association for ER-negative cases (HR 1.19; 95_%CI 0.50-2.81; p-trend_=_0.891). Long-term, regular NSAID use in the decade prior to breast cancer diagnosis was associated with reduced breast cancer-specific mortality in ER-positive cases. If confirmed, these findings support the hypothesis that potential chemopreventive properties of NSAIDs are mediated, at least in part, through suppression of estrogen biosynthesis.",,,3,,,
1181,"Cardiovascular health in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: the SEARCH CVD study OBJECTIVE: In their Strategic Impact Goal Statement, the American Heart Association focused on primordial prevention of cardiovascular risk factors by defining metrics for ideal cardiovascular health (ICH). The prevalence of ICH among youth with type 1 diabetes is unknown. Youth with type 1 diabetes face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as they age. The purpose of this report was to examine the prevalence of ICH in a population of youth with type 1 diabetes and to examine the association of ICH with measures of cardiovascular structure and function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This report is based on SEARCH CVD an ancillary study to the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth. A total of 190 adolescents with type 1 diabetes had complete data on all of the ICH metrics at baseline and had measures of arterial stiffness [pulse wave velocity (PWV), brachial distensibility (BrachD), and augmentation index (AIx)] and carotid intima-media thickness completed at a follow-up visit [on average 5__r after baseline (interquartile range 4-5)]. RESULTS: No subjects met the ICH criteria for all 7 metrics. Meeting an increasing number of ICH metrics was significantly associated with lower arterial stiffness [lower PWV of the trunk (__=_-0.02 _0.01; p_=_0.004) and AIx (__=_-2.2 _0.66; p_=_0.001), and increased BrachD (__=_0.14 _0.07; p_=_0.04)]. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing number of ICH metrics was significantly associated with decreased arterial stiffness, but prevalence of ICH in this population was low. Youth with type 1 diabetes could benefit from improvements in their cardiovascular health. _ 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,4,,,
1182,"Knowledge, attitude and practices of diabetic patients in the United Arab Emirates INTRODUCTION: Diabetes self-management education is a cornerstone of diabetes care. However, many diabetics in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) lack sufficient knowledge about their disease due to illiteracy. Thus, before considering any possible intervention it was imperative to assess present knowledge, attitudes, and practices of patients towards the management of diabetes. METHODS: A random sample of 575 DM patients was selected from diabetes outpatient's clinics of Tawam and Al-Ain hospitals in Al-Ain city (UAE) during 2006-2007, and their knowledge attitude and practice assessed using a questionnaire modified from the Michigan Diabetes Research Training Center instrument. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients had poor knowledge of diabetes. Seventy-two had negative attitudes towards having the disease and 57% had HbA(1c) levels reflecting poor glycemic control. Only seventeen percent reported having adequate blood sugar control, while 10% admitted non-compliance with their medications. Knowledge, practice and attitude scores were all statistically significantly positively, but rather weakly, associated, but none of these scores was significantly correlated with HbA(1c). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed low levels of diabetes awareness but positive attitudes towards the importance of DM care and satisfactory diabetes practices in the UAE. Programs to increase patients' awareness about DM are essential for all diabetics in the UAE in order to improve their understanding, compliance and management and, thereby, their ability to cope with the disease.",,,4,,,
1183,"Effectiveness of a worksite-based weight loss randomized controlled trial: the worksite study OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of an individually targeted Internet-based intervention with monetary incentives (INCENT) at reducing weight of overweight and obese employees when compared with a less-intensive intervention (Livin' My Weigh [LMW]) 6 months after program initiation. METHODS: Twenty-eight worksites were randomly assigned to either INCENT or LMW conditions. Both programs used evidence-based strategies to support weight loss. INCENT was delivered via daily e-mails over 12 months while LMW was delivered quarterly via both newsletters and on-site educational sessions. Generalized linear mixed models were conducted for weight change from baseline to 6 months post-program and using an intention-to-treat analysis to include all participants with baseline weight measurements. RESULTS: Across 28 worksites, 1,790 employees (M = 47 years of age; 79% Caucasian; 74% women) participated. Participants lost an average of 2.27 lbs (P_< _0.001) with a BMI decrease of 0.36 kg/m(2) (P_< _0.001) and 1.30 lbs (P_< _0.01) with a BMI decrease of 0.20 kg/m(2) (P_< _0.01) in INCENT and LMW, respectively. The differences between INCENT and LMW in weight loss and BMI reduction were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that INCENT and a minimal intervention alternative may be effective approaches to help decrease the overall obesity burden within worksites. _ 2015 The Obesity Society.",,,5,,,
1184,"Quality of parental emotional care and calculated risk for coronary heart disease OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between perceived quality of parental emotional care and calculated 10-year risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Little is understood about the role of parental emotional care in contributing to the risk for CHD. METHODS: The study sample was composed of 267 participants from the New England Family Study. Quality of parental emotional care was measured, using a validated short version of the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) as the average care scores for both parents (range = 0-12), with higher scores indicating greater care. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated, using the validated Framingham Risk Algorithm that incorporates the following prevalent CHD risk factors: age, sex, diabetes, smoking, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure. Multiple linear regression assessed associations of PBI with calculated CHD risk after adjusting for childhood socioeconomic status, depressive symptomatology, educational attainment, and body mass index. RESULTS: Among females, a 1-unit increase in the parental emotional care score resulted in a 4.6% (p = .004) decrease in the 10-year CHD risk score, after adjusting for covariates. There was no association between parental emotional care score and calculated CHD risk score in males (p = .22). CONCLUSION: Quality of parental emotional care was inversely associated with calculated 10-year CHD risk in females, and not males. Although the gender differences need further investigation and these findings require replication, these results suggest that the early childhood psychosocial environment may confer risk for CHD in adulthood.",,,8,,,
1185,"Simple risk model predicts incidence of atrial fibrillation in a racially and geographically diverse population: the CHARGE-AF consortium BACKGROUND: Tools for the prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) may identify high-risk individuals more likely to benefit from preventive interventions and serve as a benchmark to test novel putative risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual-level data from 3 large cohorts in the United States (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] study, the Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS], and the Framingham Heart Study [FHS]), including 18 556 men and women aged 46 to 94 years (19% African Americans, 81% whites) were pooled to derive predictive models for AF using clinical variables. Validation of the derived models was performed in 7672 participants from the Age, Gene and Environment-Reykjavik study (AGES) and the Rotterdam Study (RS). The analysis included 1186 incident AF cases in the derivation cohorts and 585 in the validation cohorts. A simple 5-year predictive model including the variables age, race, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes, and history of myocardial infarction and heart failure had good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.765; 95% CI, 0.748 to 0.781). Addition of variables from the electrocardiogram did not improve the overall model discrimination (C-statistic, 0.767; 95% CI, 0.750 to 0.783; categorical net reclassification improvement, -0.0032; 95% CI, -0.0178 to 0.0113). In the validation cohorts, discrimination was acceptable (AGES C-statistic, 0.664; 95% CI, 0.632 to 0.697 and RS C-statistic, 0.705; 95% CI, 0.664 to 0.747) and calibration was adequate. CONCLUSION: A risk model including variables readily available in primary care settings adequately predicted AF in diverse populations from the United States and Europe.",,,3,,,
1186,"Circulating levels of liver enzymes and incidence of atrial fibrillation: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of circulating liver enzymes have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Their possible association with atrial fibrillation (AF) has received little attention. METHODS: We studied 9333 men and women, aged 53-75 years, free of AF, participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study followed-up from 1996 to 2010. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and _ glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were measured in stored plasma samples. Incident AF was ascertained from hospitalisations and death certificates. Associations between liver enzymes and AF incidence were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12__ears, 1021 incident AF events were identified. Levels of AST, and to a lesser extent ALT, showed a U-shaped association with AF risk, with higher AF risk among individuals in the two extremes of the distribution in minimally adjusted models. The associations were weakened after adjustment for potential confounders. By contrast, GGT, modelled as log base 2, was linearly associated with AF risk after multivariable adjustment: a doubling of GGT levels was associated with a 20% increased risk of AF (95% CI 10% to 30%). Additional adjustment for inflammatory markers did not appreciably affect the results. Associations were not different in men and women, in whites and blacks, among never drinkers of alcohol, and among those without prevalent heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based prospective study, higher levels of liver enzymes, mainly GGT, were associated with an increased risk of AF. The mechanisms underlying this association deserve further scrutiny. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

1187,"Metabolomics and incidence of atrial fibrillation in african americans: the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia. Application of metabolomic approaches, which may identify novel pathways and biomarkers of disease risk, to a longitudinal epidemiologic study of AF has been limited. METHODS: We determined the prospective association of 118 serum metabolites identified through untargeted metabolomics profiling with the incidence of newly-diagnosed AF in 1919 African-American men and women from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study without AF at baseline (1987-1989). Incident AF cases through 2011 were ascertained from study electrocardiograms, hospital discharge codes, and death certificates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 22 years, we identified 183 incident AF cases. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes, prevalent heart failure, prevalent coronary heart disease, and kidney function, two conjugated bile acids (glycolithocholate sulfate and glycocholenate sulfate) were significantly associated with AF risk after correcting for multiple comparisons (p< 0.0004). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of AF were 1.22 (1.12-1.32) for glycolithocholate sulfate and 1.22 (1.10-1.35) for glycocholenate sulfate per 1-standard deviation higher levels. Associations were not appreciably different after additional adjustment for alcohol consumption or concentrations of circulating albumin and liver enzymes. CONCLUSION: We found an association of higher levels of two bile acids with an increased risk of AF, pointing to a potential novel pathway in AF pathogenesis. Replication of results in independent studies is warranted.",,,3,,,
1188,"Serum metabolomics and incidence of atrial fibrillation (from the atherosclerosis risk in communities study) We have previously identified associations of 2 circulating secondary bile acids (glycocholenate and glycolithocolate sulfate) with atrial fibrillation (AF) risk in 1,919 blacks in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort. We aimed to replicate these findings in an independent sample of 2,003 white and black Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities participants, and performed a new metabolomic analysis in the combined sample of 3,922 participants, followed between 1987 and 2013. Metabolomic profiling was done in baseline serum samples using gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. AF was ascertained from electrocardiograms, hospitalizations, and death certificates. We used multivariable Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of AF by 1 standard deviation difference of metabolite levels. Over a mean follow-up of 20 years, 608 participants developed AF. Glycocholenate sulfate was associated with AF in the replication and combined samples (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00, 1.21 and HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04, 1.22, respectively). Glycolithocolate sulfate was not related to AF risk in the replication sample (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92, 1.13). An analysis of 245 metabolites in the combined cohort identified 3 additional metabolites associated with AF after multiple-comparison correction: pseudouridine (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10, 1.28), uridine (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79, 0.93) and acisoga (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.09, 1.26). In conclusion, we replicated a prospective association among a previously identified secondary bile acid, glycocholenate sulfate, and AF incidence, and identified new metabolites involved in nucleoside and polyamine metabolism as markers of AF risk.

1189,"Impact of breastfeeding duration on age at menarche The study aims to assess the relation between breastfeeding duration and age at menarche. Analysis was based on a cohort of 994 Filipino girls born in 1983-1984 and followed up from infancy to adulthood by the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. The main outcome was self-reported age at menarche. Cox regression was used to investigate the relation between duration of exclusive and any breastfeeding with age at menarche with adjustment sequentially for specific sets of known socioeconomic, maternal, genetic, and prenatal confounders. The estimated median of age at menarche was 13.08 years. After adjustment for potential confounders of the association of breastfeeding with age at menarche, exclusive breastfeeding duration retained an independent and significant association with age at menarche. An increase in 1 month of exclusive breastfeeding decreases the hazard of attaining earlier menarche by 6% (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.90, 0.98). Any breastfeeding duration was not associated with age at menarche. Although this is the first longitudinal study that reveals a negative association between exclusive breastfeeding and early menarche, the relation is still elusive. Further longitudinal studies within different contexts are warranted to assess the generalizability of these findings.",,,3,,,
1190,"Utility of large consanguineous family-based model for investigating the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus OBJECTIVES: This study examined the utility of a family-based model for replicating the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS AND RESULTS: In a total of 232 members of a large consanguineous Omani Arab pedigree (age: 16-80years), there were 27 diabetics and 50 prediabetics (17 with impaired fasting glucose and 33 with impaired glucose tolerance). All 232 individuals underwent anthropometric and biochemical investigations and genotyped for 14 known common gene variants of modest effect on T2D risk. Power analysis at a LOD score of 3, gave 80% power to locate a single specific locus that accounts for 52% of the total phenotypic variation. Measured genotype analysis (MGA) was used to determine heritability of various quantitative traits (QTs) which ranged 25-56%. Using MGA, some common gene variants were found to have little (< 5%) but significant impact on the heritability of T2D related QTs [KCNJ11 (rs5219), p=0.004]; [IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), p=0.02]; [SLC30A8 (rs13266634), p=0.05]; [CAPN10 (rs2975760), p=0.031]; [FTO (rs8050136), p=0.023]; [FTO (rs9939609), p=0.018] and [SLC30A8 (rs13266634), p=0.05]. Sib-TDT analysis showed that some gene variants were significantly associated with T2D risk but didn't reach the level of significance after Bonferroni correction [KCNJ11 (rs5219), p=0.047] and [CAPN10 (rs41266971), p=0.035]. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that, in principle, a family-based model with minor limitations could be used to replicate some of the results of large GWAS case-control studies. This model could successfully be applied for the future discovery, by deep sequencing, of rare gene variants. Copyright _ 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,8,,,
1191,"U.S. trends in antiretroviral therapy use, HIV RNA plasma viral loads, and CD4 T-lymphocyte cell counts among HIV-infected persons, 2000 to 2008 BACKGROUND: The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy targets for 2015 include ""increasing access to care and improving health outcomes for persons living with HIV in the United States"" (PLWH-US). OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the utility of the NA-ACCORD (North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design) for monitoring trends in the HIV epidemic in the United States and to present trends in HIV treatment and related health outcomes. DESIGN: Trends from annual cross-sectional analyses comparing patients from pooled, multicenter, prospective, clinical HIV cohort studies with PLWH-US, as reported to national surveillance systems in 40 states. SETTING: U.S. HIV outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: HIV-infected adults with 1 or more HIV RNA plasma viral load (HIV VL) or CD4 T-lymphocyte (CD4) cell count measured in any calendar year from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2008. MEASUREMENTS: Annual rates of antiretroviral therapy use, HIV VL, and CD4 cell count at death. RESULTS: 45 529 HIV-infected persons received care in an NA-ACCORD-participating U.S. clinical cohort from 2000 to 2008. In 2008, the 26 030 NA-ACCORD participants in care and the 655 966 PLWH-US had qualitatively similar demographic characteristics. From 2000 to 2008, the proportion of participants prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy increased by 9 percentage points to 83% (P < 0.001), whereas the proportion with suppressed HIV VL (_2.7 log10 copies/mL) increased by 26 percentage points to 72% (P < 0.001). Median CD4 cell count at death more than tripled to 0.209 _ 109 cells/L (P < 0.001). LIMITATION: The usual limitations of observational data apply. CONCLUSION: The NA-ACCORD is the largest cohort of HIV-infected adults in clinical care in the United States that is demographically similar to PLWH-US in 2008. From 2000 to 2008, increases were observed in the percentage of prescribed HAART, the percentage who achieved a suppressed HIV VL, and the median CD4 cell count at death.

1192,"Late presentation for human immunodeficiency virus care in the United States and Canada BACKGROUND. Initiatives to improve early detection and access to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) services have increased over time. We assessed the immune status of patients at initial presentation for HIV care from 1997 to 2007 in 13 US and Canadian clinical cohorts. METHODS. We analyzed data from 44,491 HIV-infected patients enrolled in the North American-AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design. We identified first presentation for HIV care as the time of first CD4(+) T lymphocyte (CD4) count and excluded patients who prior to this date had HIV RNA measurements, evidence of antiretroviral exposure, or a history of AIDS-defining illness. Trends in mean CD4 count (measured as cells/mm(3)) and 95% confidence intervals were determined using linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, HIV transmission risk, and cohort. RESULTS. Median age at first presentation for HIV care increased over time (range, 40-43 years; P < .01), whereas the percentage of patients with injection drug use HIV transmission risk decreased (from 26% to 14%; P < .01) and heterosexual transmission risk increased (from 16% to 23%; P < .01). Median CD4 count at presentation increased from 256 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 96-455 cells/mm(3)) to 317 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 135-517 cells/mm(3)) from 1997 to 2007 (P < .01). The percentage of patients with a CD4 count > or = 350 cells/mm(3) at first presentation also increased from 1997 to 2007 (from 38% to 46%; P < .01). The estimated adjusted mean CD4 count increased at a rate of 6 cells/mm(3) per year (95% confidence interval, 5-7 cells/mm(3) per year). CONCLUSION. CD4 count at first presentation for HIV care has increased annually over the past 11 years but has remained < 350 cells/mm(3), which suggests the urgent need for earlier HIV diagnosis and treatment.",,,5,,,
1193,"CD4 count at presentation for HIV care in the United States and Canada: are those over 50 years more likely to have a delayed presentation? We assessed CD4 count at initial presentation for HIV care among _50-year-olds from 1997-2007 in 13 US and Canadian clinical cohorts and compared to <50-year-olds. 44,491 HIV-infected individuals in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) were included in our study. Trends in mean CD4 count (measured as cells/mm_) and 95% confidence intervals ([,]) were determined using linear regression stratified by age category and adjusted for gender, race/ethnicity, HIV transmission risk and cohort. From 1997-2007, the proportion of individuals presenting for HIV care who were _50-years-old increased from 17% to 27% (p-value < 0.01). The median CD4 count among _50 year-olds was consistently lower than younger adults. The interaction of age group and calendar year was significant (p-value <0.01) with both age groups experiencing modest annual improvements over time (< 50-year-olds: 5 [4 , 6] cells/mm3; _50-year-olds: 7 [5 , 9] cells/mm_), after adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, HIV transmission risk group and cohort; however, increases in the two groups were similar after 2000. A greater proportion of older individuals had an AIDS-defining diagnosis at, or within three months prior to, first presentation for HIV care compared to younger individuals (13% vs. 10%, respectively). Due to the increasing proportion, consistently lower CD4 counts, and more advanced HIV disease in adults _50-year-old at first presentation for HIV care, renewed HIV testing efforts are needed.",,,6,,,
1194,"Contributions of traditional and HIV-related risk factors on non-AIDS-defining cancer, myocardial infarction, and end-stage liver and renal diseases in adults with HIV in the USA and Canada: a collaboration of cohort studies BACKGROUND: Adults with HIV have an increased burden of non-AIDS-defining cancers, myocardial infarction, end-stage liver disease, and end-stage renal disease. The objective of this study was to estimate the population attributable fractions (PAFs) of preventable or modifiable HIV-related and traditional risk factors for non-AIDS-defining cancers, myocardial infarction, end-stage liver disease, and end-stage renal disease outcomes. METHODS: We included participants receiving care in academic and community-based outpatient HIV clinical cohorts in the USA and Canada from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2014, who contributed to the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design and who had validated non-AIDS-defining cancers, myocardial infarction, end-stage liver disease, or end-stage renal disease outcomes. Traditional risk factors were tobacco smoking, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, renal impairment (stage 4 chronic kidney disease), and hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus infections. HIV-related risk factors were low CD4 count (< 200 cells per _L), detectable plasma HIV RNA (>400 copies per mL), and history of a clinical AIDS diagnosis. PAFs and 95% CIs were estimated to quantify the proportion of outcomes that could be avoided if the risk factor was prevented. FINDINGS: In each of the study populations for the four outcomes (1405 of 61_500 had non-AIDS-defining cancer, 347 of 29_515 had myocardial infarctions, 387 of 35_044 had end-stage liver disease events, and 255 of 35_620 had end-stage renal disease events), about 17% were older than 50 years at study entry, about 50% were non-white, and about 80% were men. Preventing smoking would avoid 24% (95% CI 13-35) of these cancers and 37% (7-66) of the myocardial infarctions. Preventing elevated total cholesterol and hypertension would avoid the greatest proportion of myocardial infarctions: 44% (30-58) for cholesterol and 42% (28-56) for hypertension. For liver disease, the PAF was greatest for hepatitis C infection (33%; 95% CI 17-48). For renal disease, the PAF was greatest for hypertension (39%; 26-51) followed by elevated total cholesterol (22%; 13-31), detectable HIV RNA (19; 9-31), and low CD4 cell count (13%; 4-21). INTERPRETATION: The substantial proportion of non-AIDS-defining cancers, myocardial infarction, end-stage liver disease, and end-stage renal disease outcomes that could be prevented with interventions on traditional risk factors elevates the importance of screening for these risk factors, improving the effectiveness of prevention (or modification) of these risk factors, and creating sustainable care models to implement such interventions during the decades of life of adults living with HIV who are receiving care.

1197,"A feasibility study of supply and demand for diabetes prevention programs in north carolina INTRODUCTION: Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPPs) have shown that healthy eating and moderate physical activity are effective ways of delaying and preventing type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance. We assessed willingness to pay for DPPs from the perspective of potential recipients and the cost of providing these programs from the perspective of community health centers and local health departments in North Carolina. METHODS: We used contingent valuation to determine how much potential recipients would be willing to pay to participate in DPPs under 3 different models: delivered by registered professionals (traditional model), by community health workers, or online. By using information on the minimum reimbursement rate at which public health agencies would be prepared to provide the 3 models, we estimated the marginal costs per person of supplying the programs. Matching supply and demand, we estimated the degree of cost sharing between recipients and providers. RESULTS: Potential program recipients (n = 99) were willing to pay more for programs led by registered professionals than by community health workers, and they preferred face-to-face contact to an online format. Socioeconomic status (measured by education and employment) and age played the biggest roles in determining willingness to pay. Leaders of public health agencies (n = 27) reported up to a 40% difference in the cost of providing the DPP, depending on the delivery model. CONCLUSION: By using willingness to pay to understand demand for DPPs and computing the provider's marginal cost of providing these services, we can estimate cost sharing and market coverage of these services and thus compare the viability of alternate approaches to scaling up and sustaining DPPs with available resources.",,,4,,,

Transitions across the following states were modeled: development of radiographic HOA (rHOA; Kellgren-Lawrence grade [KLG] of< _2); development of hip symptoms (self-reported hip pain, aching, or stiffness on most days) or symptomatic HOA (sxHOA; rHOA and symptoms in the same hip), and resolution of symptoms. Obesity (body mass index __30__g/m2) and self-reported DM and CVD were the time-dependent comorbid conditions of interest. Markov multi-state models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals to describe the associations between the conditions and HOA states. RESULTS: The sample included 33% African Americans, 39% men, with a mean (SD) age of 62.2 (9.8) years; the frequencies of the comorbidities increased substantially over time. When considered individually, obesity was associated with incident hip symptoms, while CVD and DM were associated with reduced symptom resolution. For those with >_1 comorbidity, the likelihood of incident sxHOA increased, while that of symptom resolution significantly decreased. When stratified by sex, the association between obesity and incident symptoms was only seen in women; among men with DM versus men without, there was a significant (~_75%) reduction in symptom resolution in those with rHOA. When stratified by race, African Americans with DM, versus those without, were much more likely to develop sxHOA. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid chronic conditions are common in individuals with OA, and these conditions have a significant impact on the persistence and progression of HOA. OA management decisions, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic, should include considerations of the inter-relationships between OA and common comorbidities such as DM and CVD.",,,9,,,
1199,"Patients' confidence in methods of blood pressure assessment and their reported adherence to antihypertensive medications OBJECTIVE: Adherence to antihypertensive medications is often less than optimal. Research suggests that patients have limited confidence regarding whether office blood pressure (BP) assessments represent their 'true' BP, which may further promote poor adherence to BP-lowering medication. We assessed peoples' confidence in the methods of BP assessment and examined the associations between patients' confidence levels and medication adherence comparing office and home BP-monitoring techniques. METHODS: We surveyed US adults aged 30 years or older (N=1010), all of whom had undergone an office BP measurement within the past 6 months. Respondents who indicated being prescribed antihypertensive medication (N=429) were asked to indicate their level of confidence on a 1-9 scale that BP measurements represented their true BP, and their adherence to antihypertensive medication using the eight-item Morisky Medical Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). RESULTS: Respondents had equal confidence that both office BP measurements and home monitoring measurements reflected their true BP (median=7). Respondents indicated that they would have slightly more confidence in ambulatory BP monitoring (median=8). As respondents' confidence in the assessments of BP from office measurements and home monitoring increased from 1 to 9, the mean MMAS-8 score, adjusted for age, race, and education, increased from 5.38 to 6.25 (P=0.053) and from 5.50 to 6.14 (P=0.25), respectively. CONCLUSION: As patients' confidence in a BP assessment method increases, so too does their reported adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications. This finding further supports the incorporation of methods in which patients can feel confident that the measurements are representative of their 'true' BP.",,,4,,,
1200,"Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 2 knockdown leads to decreased fatty acid oxidation in fat body and reduced reproductive capacity in the insect Rhodnius prolixus Long-chain acyl-CoA esters are important intermediates in lipid metabolism and are synthesized from fatty acids by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL). The hematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas' disease, produces glycerolipids in the midgut after a blood meal, which are stored as triacylglycerol in the fat body and eggs. We identified twenty acyl-CoA synthetase genes in R. prolixus, two encoding ACSL isoforms (RhoprAcsl1 and RhoprAcsl2). RhoprAcsl1 transcripts increased in posterior midgut on the second day after feeding, and RhoprAcsl2 was highly transcribed on the tenth day. Both enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant RhoprACSL1 and RhoprACSL2 had broad pH optima (7.5-9.5 and 6.5-9.5, respectively), were inhibited by triacsin C, and were rosiglitazone-insensitive. Both showed similar apparent Km for palmitic and oleic acid (2-6 _M), but different Km for arachidonic acid (0.5 and 6 _M for RhoprACSL1-Flag and RhoprACSL2-Flag, respectively). The knockdown of RhoprAcsl1 did not result in noticeable phenotypes. However, RhoprACSL2 deficient insects exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in triacylglycerol content in the fat body, and 90% decrease in fatty acid _-oxidation. RhoprAcsl2 knockdown also resulted in 20% increase in lifespan, delayed digestion, 30% reduced oviposition, and 50% reduction in egg hatching. Laid eggs and hatched nymphs showed remarkable alterations in morphology. In summary, R. prolixus ACSL isoforms have distinct roles on lipid metabolism. Although RhoprACSL1 functions remain unclear, we propose that RhoprACSL2 is the main contributor for the formation of the intracellular acyl-CoA pool channeled for _-oxidation in the fat body, and is also required for normal reproduction.

1201,"Deficiency of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 decreases triacylglycerol storage and induces fatty acid oxidation in insect fat body Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPAT) catalyze the initial and rate-limiting step for the de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). Four mammalian GPAT isoforms have been identified: the mitochondria-associated GPAT1 and 2, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated GPAT3 and 4. In the insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas' disease, we previously predicted a mitochondrial-like isoform (RhoprGPAT1) from genomic data. In the current study, we clone the RhoprGPAT1 coding sequence and identify an ER-associated GPAT (RhoprGPAT4) as the second isoform in the insect. RhoprGPAT1 contributes 15% of the total GPAT activity in anterior midgut, 50% in posterior midgut and fat body, and 70% in the ovary. The RhoprGpat1 gene is the predominant transcript in the midgut and fat body. To evaluate the physiological relevance of RhoprGPAT1, we generate RhoprGPAT1-deficient insects. The knockdown of RhoprGpat1 results in 50% and 65% decrease in TAG content in the posterior midgut and fat body, respectively. RhoprGpat1-deficient insects also exhibits impaired lipid droplet expansion and a 2-fold increase in fatty acid _-oxidation rates in the fat body. We propose that the RhoprGPAT1 mitochondrial-like isoform is required to channel fatty acyl chains towards TAG synthesis and away from _-oxidation. Such a process is crucial for the insect lipid homeostasis. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
1202,"Trends in Abortion Incidence and Availability in North Carolina, 1980-2013 OBJECTIVES: Abortion incidence has declined nationally during the last decade. In recent years, many states, including North Carolina, have passed legislation related to the provision of abortion services. Despite the changing political environment, there is no comprehensive analysis on past and current trends related to unintended pregnancy and abortion in North Carolina. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of vital registration data made publicly available by the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics. Birth and induced abortion records were obtained for the years 1980 to 2013. We describe abortion incidence and demographic characteristics of women obtaining abortions over time. RESULTS: The number of North Carolina abortions declined 36% between 1980 and 2013. The abortion ratio declined from 26/100 pregnancies (live births and abortions) in 1980 to just 14/100 in 2013. These ratios, however, vary across demographic subgroups. In 2013, the abortion ratio was more than 2 times greater for non-Hispanic black women than non-Hispanic white women (22 and 9, respectively). Among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women, the abortion ratio is greater among women with a previous pregnancy as compared with women in their first pregnancy. For non-Hispanic white women, the abortion ratios are similar for first and higher-order pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in North Carolina are similar to national trends; however, detailed analyses by race/ethnicity, age, and parity demonstrate important distinctions among abortion patients over time in the state. We discuss these trends in relation to policy changes and increased access to effective contraceptives.",,,6,,,
1203,"What Child Oral Health-Related Behaviors Can First-time Mothers Actualize? A Pragmatic Prospective Study INTRODUCTION: First-time pregnant women are considered to be receptive to health information, rendering the prenatal period an opportune time to provide helpful information on the importance of child-related oral health. However, little is known about pregnant women's knowledge of child oral health-related behaviors (COHBs) during pregnancy and their implementation after birth. We sought to address this knowledge gap by a prospective investigation of intended and actualized oral health behaviors among first-time pregnant women. METHODS: We examined relationships between intended and actualized COHBs and their correlations with changes in oral health knowledge, health literacy, general self-efficacy, and dental neglect in a cohort of first-time pregnant clients at Women, Infants, and Children sites in North Carolina-participants of a large community-based study. The COHBs were related to diet (i.e., frequency of fruit juice and sweet snacks consumption and nighttime bottle-feeding) and oral hygiene practices (e.g., performance of daily oral hygiene and use of fluoridated toothpaste). Analyses relied on descriptive statistics and bivariate tests (Student's t and McNemar's). Data were collected from 48 participants (White, 44%; African American, 40%; Native American, 17%) at baseline and again at least 12 months after the birth of their first child. RESULTS: On average, most mothers actualized 3 of 5 COHBs (range, 1 to 4). Significant differences between before and after birth were noted for frequency of sweet snacks consumption and putting the baby in bed with a bottle. No correlation was found between knowledge, literacy, self-efficacy, neglect, and sociodemographic characteristics and COHB actualization. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that first-time mothers in the studied population are likely to implement some but not all positive intended COHBs during pregnancy. Interventions are needed to assist women in implementing these practices. We support that, for prenatal interventional efforts to reap positive benefits, messaging should be personalized and include specific guidance on how to implement these recommendations. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: A knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the relationship between first-time mothers' intended and actualized child oral health behaviors, with implications in the optimal timing of infant and early childhood oral health messaging. Our findings suggest that first-time mothers are likely to implement some but not all positive behaviors that they intended to adopt during pregnancy. Interventions are needed to assist women in implementing these practices.",,,3,,,
1204,"A mobile application to monitor mode, content and duration of health navigation services for people living with HIV in Guatemala Health navigation is increasingly being used to support people living with HIV, but timely monitoring of navigation is challenging due to the burden of reporting a high volume of diverse activities. We designed a mobile application (app) for navigators to report their interactions with men who have sex with men living with HIV (n_=_374), including: (1) mode of support; (2) content; and (3) duration. We assessed sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of the study sample and calculated monitoring system indicators. We also conducted qualitative interviews with navigators (n_=_7) and used thematic analysis to assess app acceptability and usability. From January 2017 to June 2018, 95.3% of participants interacted with their navigator at least one time and 4281 reports were recorded by nine navigators. The median number of interactions per participant was 10 (range: 1-46). The majority of interactions (71.6%) occurred remotely. Most frequently covered topics included: appointment reminders (36.9%), employment (19.9%), and family (15.5%). Navigators indicated that the system was easy to use, but some did not use it in real time as intended. Timely access to navigator data enabled feedback and continuous training. These data can also facilitate analysis of intensity and content of interactions to improve tailoring and sustainability.",,,6,,,
1205,"Important Role of Menarche in Development of Estrogen Receptor-Negative Breast Cancer in African American Women BACKGROUND: Menarche is a critical time point for diverging fates of mammary cells of origin. African American women have young age at menarche, which could be associated with their high rates of estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer. METHODS: In the AMBER Consortium, using harmonized data from 4426 African American women with breast cancer and 17 474 controls, we used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ages at menarche and first live birth (FLB), and the interval between, in relation to ER+ and ER- breast cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Risk of ER- breast cancer was reduced with later age at menarche among both parous and nulliparous women (_15 vs < 11 years OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.81 and OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.29 to 1.10, respectively), with no effect of age at FLB. For ER+ breast cancer, the inverse association was weaker among nulliparous women. While longer intervals between menarche and FLB were associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer in a dose-response fashion (OR for 20 year interval = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.79, P trend = .003), ER- risk was only increased for intervals up to 14 years and not beyond (P trend = .33). CONCLUSIONS: While ER- breast cancer risk was markedly reduced in women with a late age at menarche, there was not a clear pattern of increased risk with longer interval between menarche and FLB, as was observed for ER+ breast cancer. These findings indicate that etiologic pathways involving adolescence and pregnancy may differ for ER- and ER+ breast cancer. _ The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

1206,"The Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research Consortium: Integrating Genomic Sequencing in Diverse and Medically Underserved Populations The Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium, now in its second funding cycle, is investigating the effectiveness of integrating genomic (exome or genome) sequencing into the clinical care of diverse and medically underserved individuals in a variety of healthcare settings and disease states. The consortium comprises a coordinating center, six funded extramural clinical projects, and an ongoing National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intramural project. Collectively, these projects aim to enroll and sequence over 6,100 participants in four years. At least 60% of participants will be of non-European ancestry or from underserved settings, with the goal of diversifying the populations that are providing an evidence base for genomic medicine. Five of the six clinical projects are enrolling pediatric patients with various phenotypes. One of these five projects is also enrolling couples whose fetus has a structural anomaly, and the sixth project is enrolling adults at risk for hereditary cancer. The ongoing NHGRI intramural project has enrolled primarily healthy adults. Goals of the consortium include assessing the clinical utility of genomic sequencing, exploring medical follow up and cascade testing of relatives, and evaluating patient-provider-laboratory level interactions that influence the use of this technology. The findings from the CSER consortium will offer patients, healthcare systems, and policymakers a clearer understanding of the opportunities and challenges of providing genomic medicine in diverse populations and settings, and contribute evidence toward developing best practices for the delivery of clinically useful and cost-effective genomic sequencing in diverse healthcare settings.

1207,"Interpregnancy Care Interpregnancy care aims to maximize a woman's level of wellness not just in between pregnancies and during subsequent pregnancies, but also along her life course. Because the interpregnancy period is a continuum for overall health and wellness, all women of reproductive age who have been pregnant regardless of the outcome of their pregnancies (ie, miscarriage, abortion, preterm, full-term delivery), should receive interpregnancy care as a continuum from postpartum care. The initial components of interpregnancy care should include the components of postpartum care, such as reproductive life planning, screening for depression, vaccination, managing diabetes or hypertension if needed, education about future health, assisting the patient to develop a postpartum care team, and making plans for long-term medical care. In women with chronic medical conditions, interpregnancy care provides an opportunity to optimize health before a subsequent pregnancy. For women who will not have any future pregnancies, the period after pregnancy also affords an opportunity for secondary prevention and improvement of future health.

1208,"Triggered Escalating Real-Time Adherence Intervention to Promote Rapid HIV Viral Suppression Among Youth Living With HIV Failing Antiretroviral Therapy: Protocol for a Triggered Escalating Real-Time Adherence Intervention BACKGROUND: Youth living with HIV (YLWH) are confronted with many self-care challenges that can be experienced as overwhelming in the context of normal developmental processes that characterize adolescence and young adulthood. A sizable minority of YLWH have unsuppressed viral loads in the United States attributable to antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. Interventions to promote sustained viral suppression in YLWH are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Triggered Escalating Real-Time Adherence (TERA) intervention in comparison with standard of care (SOC) in YLWH (aged 13-24 years) failing ART on (1) primary outcome measures-HIV viral suppression (VLS), defined as both < 200 copies/ml and < 50 copies/ml at 12 weeks, and (2) secondary outcome measures-VLS rates and rates of ART adherence at 24, 36, and 48 weeks as well as patterns of adherence over time as measured by an electronic dose monitoring (EDM) device. METHODS: The TERA study is a phase 2, multisite clinical trial conducted with 120 YLWH failing ART (randomized 1:1 to TERA or SOC) at participating clinical sites within the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN). Participants are followed for a total of 48 weeks. For TERA arm participants, the first 12 weeks involve delivery of the intervention. For all participants, clinical outcomes are collected throughout follow-up, and adherence is assessed using EDM over the full 48 weeks. During the 12-week intervention period, TERA arm participants receive 3 remote coaching sessions delivered in clinic via videoconferencing timed to coincide with baseline and follow-up clinical visits, text message reminders when the EDM has not been opened at dose time (which escalate to 2-way theory-informed short message service coaching interactions in response to real-time nonadherence), and review of dosing graphs produced by EDM at follow-up visits. RESULTS: Launch dates for enrollment varied by site. Enrollment began in April 2018 and is expected to be completed by August 2019, with results presented by the second quarter of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Effective, generalizable, and scalable approaches to rapidly assist YLWH failing to achieve and sustain VLS may have a substantial impact on individual health and efforts to curb transmission. Coaching for a brief but intensive period from remote coaches and using communication channels common to youth may offer multiple unique advantages in promoting self-care.

1209,"Effect of medicaid policy changes on medication adherence: differences by baseline adherence BACKGROUND: In 2001, the North Carolina (NC) Medicaid program reduced the number of days prescription supply that enrollees could fill from 100 days to 34 days and increased copayments for brand-name medications. Previous work has shown that a change in these policies led to a decrease in medication adherence from 2.9 to 8.0 percentage points in specific populations with chronic conditions. Studies have also shown that days supply limits and copayment increases have heterogeneous effects based on enrollees' baseline characteristics, including baseline adherence. However, this phenomenon has not been studied in the Medicaid population. We undertook this study to assess the heterogeneous effect of the NC Medicaid policy changes in groups with varying levels of baseline adherence. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether restrictions on days supply had heterogeneous effects in subgroups defined by medication adherence before the policy changes. METHODS: A partial difference-in-difference-in-differences model with fixed effects was used to compare medication adherence before and after the NC Medicaid policy changes among Medicaid enrollees subject to the policy changes because of their use of long prescriptions (> 40 days) as compared with (a) NC Medicaid enrollees using short prescriptions (< 40 days) before policy adoption, as well as (b) Medicaid enrollees in Georgia restricted to a 31 days supply through the study period. Medicaid enrollees were included if they filled a prescription for 1 of the following medication classes: antihypertensives, lipid-lowering drugs, or antipsychotics. The effect of the policy changes on medication adherence, calculated using the proportion of days covered (PDC) each quarter by baseline adherence level and clinical condition group, was studied. Average adherence levels over the 18-month prechange period were used to stratify individuals into 3 baseline adherence groups: fully adherent (PDC _ 80%), partially adherent (50%-79%), and nonadherent (PDC _ 50%). RESULTS: Enrollees fully adherent at baseline observed a 2.0 (P = 0.001) and 1.2 (P < 0.001) percentage-point decline in adherence for the lipid-lowering drug and antihypertensive cohorts, respectively, in the period after the policy changes. The nonadherent and partially adherent cohorts in the statin group observed an increase in adherence by 1.7-2.6 (P < 0.05) percentage points in the post-index period. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence changes after cost containment policies have a heterogeneous effect on individuals with varying baseline adherence in the Medicaid population. Individuals fully adherent at baseline decreased adherence following policy changes, while individuals partially adherent and nonadherent at baseline either had no change or showed increases in adherence, possibly because of increased contact with pharmacists and clinicians required by shorter prescription lengths. Managed care strategies to control costs should take into consideration the heterogeneity of responses by the enrollees to these policies. Furthermore, policies that consider baseline characteristics of enrollees may be more effective in improving adherence.

We investigated differences in sex responses in serum CK activity and renal function measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after an exercise session. Twenty-two healthy and trained volunteers (11 males and 11 females) performed 17 resistance exercises with 3___12 repetitions in a circuit training fashion. Subjects provided blood samples prior to exercise session, and at 24, 48, and 72_h following exercise sessions for creatine kinase and creatinine. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected before and 72_h after the exercise. Estimate (e) GFR was obtained by using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation adjusted for males and females. After the exercise session, males showed greater serum CK activity than females (p_< _0.02), serum creatinine increased 31.3_% for males and 29.8_% for females, and urinary creatinine decreased on average 5.4_% for males and 0.6_% for females, with no significant differences (p_>_0.05) between sex for serum and urinary creatinine. eGFR decreased significantly for males (~10_%) and females (~8_%), but also without a difference between the sexes (p_>_0.05). The correlation between CK and eGFR was significant for males (r_=_-0.794; p_=_0.003), and females (r_=_-0.8875; p_< _0.001).

1216,"Development of a PROMIS item bank to measure pain interference This paper describes the psychometric properties of the PROMIS-pain interference (PROMIS-PI) bank. An initial candidate item pool (n=644) was developed and evaluated based on the review of existing instruments, interviews with patients, and consultation with pain experts. From this pool, a candidate item bank of 56 items was selected and responses to the items were collected from large community and clinical samples. A total of 14,848 participants responded to all or a subset of candidate items. The responses were calibrated using an item response theory (IRT) model. A final 41-item bank was evaluated with respect to IRT assumptions, model fit, differential item function (DIF), precision, and construct and concurrent validity. Items of the revised bank had good fit to the IRT model (CFI and NNFI/TLI ranged from 0.974 to 0.997), and the data were strongly unidimensional (e.g., ratio of first and second eigenvalue=35). Nine items exhibited statistically significant DIF. However, adjusting for DIF had little practical impact on score estimates and the items were retained without modifying scoring. Scores provided substantial information across levels of pain; for scores in the T-score range 50-80, the reliability was equivalent to 0.96-0.99. Patterns of correlations with other health outcomes supported the construct validity of the item bank. The scores discriminated among persons with different numbers of chronic conditions, disabling conditions, levels of self-reported health, and pain intensity (p< 0.0001). The results indicated that the PROMIS-PI items constitute a psychometrically sound bank. Computerized adaptive testing and short forms are available.

1217,"Exploring the spatial relationship between primary road distance to antenatal clinics and HIV prevalence in pregnant females of Lilongwe, Malawi While urbanization in a sub-Saharan African (SSA) context can lead to greater independence in women, various sociological, biological, and geographical factors in urban areas may keep women at a higher risk for HIV than men. Access to major roads during Malawi's transition into rapid urbanization may leave women disproportionately vulnerable to HIV infection. It is not well established whether women who report to health clinics closer to major roads have higher or lower levels of HIV. In this study we explored the spatial heterogeneity of HIV prevalence among pregnant females in Lilongwe District, Malawi. Using Geographic Information Systems, we visually represented patterns of HIV prevalence in relation to primary roads. HIV prevalence data for 2015 were obtained from 44 antenatal clinics (ANC) in Lilongwe District. ANC prevalence data were aggregated to the administrative area and mapped. Euclidean distance between clinics and two primary roads that run through Lilongwe District were measured. A correlation was run to assess the relationship between area-level ANC HIV prevalence and clinic distance to the nearest primary road. ANC HIV prevalence ranged from 0% to 10.3%. Clinic to major road distance ranged from 0.1 to 35 km. Correlation results ( r= -0.622, p_=_0.002) revealed a significant negative relationship between clinic distance to primary road and HIV prevalence, indicating that the farther the clinics stood from primary roads, the lower the reported antenatal HIV prevalence. Overall, the clinic catchments through which the major roads run reported higher ANC HIV prevalence. Antenatal HIV prevalence decreases as ANC distance from primary roads increases in Lilongwe, Malawi. As urbanization continues to grow in this region, road distance may serve as a good indicator of HIV burden and help to guide targeted prevention and treatment efforts.",,,6,,,
1218,"Novel statistical methodology reveals that hip shape is associated with incident radiographic hip osteoarthritis among African American women INTRODUCTION: Hip shape is a risk factor for the development of hip osteoarthritis (OA), and current methods to assess hip shape from radiographs are limited; therefore this study explored current and novel methods to assess hip shape. METHODS: Data from a prior case-control study nested in the Johnston County OA Project were used, including 382 hips (from 342 individuals). Hips were classified by radiographic hip OA (RHOA) status as RHOA cases (baseline Kellgren Lawrence grade [KLG] 0 or 1, follow-up [mean 6 years] KLG___2) or controls (KLG_=_0 or 1_at both baseline and follow-up). Proximal femur shape was assessed using a 60-point model as previously described. The current analysis explored commonly used principal component analysis (PCA), as well as novel statistical methodologies suited to high dimension low sample size settings (Distance Weighted Discrimination [DWD] and Distance Projection Permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing) to assess differences between cases and controls. RESULTS: Using these novel methodologies, we were able to better characterize morphologic differences by sex and race. In particular, the proximal femurs of African American women demonstrated significantly different shapes between cases and controls, implying an important role for sex and race in the development of RHOA. Notably, discrimination was improved with the use of DWD and DiProPerm compared to PCA. CONCLUSIONS: DWD with DiProPerm significance testing provides improved discrimination of variation in hip morphology between groups, and enables subgroup analyses even under small sample sizes.

GERD has high prevalence and is the major risk factor for Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). We conduct a large GERD GWAS meta-analysis (80,265 cases, 305,011 controls), identifying 25 independent genome-wide significant loci for GERD. Several of the implicated genes are existing or putative drug targets. Loci discovery is greatest with a broad GERD definition (including cases defined by self-report or medication data). Further, 91% of the GERD risk-increasing alleles also increase BE and/or EA risk, greatly expanding gene discovery for these traits. Our results map genes for GERD and related traits and uncover potential new drug targets for these conditions.",,,8,,,
1220,"Determinants of health workers intention to use malaria rapid diagnostic test in Kintampo North Municipality, Ghana - a cross-sectional study BACKGROUND: Resistance to antimalarial drugs resulting from overuse of the medication remains a threat to malaria control and elimination in endemic settings including Ghana. Reliance on clinical signs alone results in patients being diagnosed with malaria falsely. The World Health Organization and local guidelines recommend test-based diagnosis with malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) or microscopy before prescription of antimalarial drugs. Despite the scale-up of mRDT through the procurement of mRDT kits and training of health workers on mRDT-led diagnosis of malaria, its use remains low with about 85% health workers reporting satisfaction with the presumptive diagnosis. METHODS: A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the determinants of intention to use mRDT among health workers in Kintampo North Municipality, Ghana. A total of 110 health workers were surveyed from February to April 2017. Intention to use mRDT was measured as the primary outcome with a 5-item scale questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We then tested its association with hypothesized determinants: coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive action informed by the Normalization Process Theory (NPT) as well as health workers' background characteristics using linear regression modeling. RESULTS: The mean intention to use mRDT score was 82% (SD: 12.6). The regression model showed health workers intention to use mRDT was positively associated with coherence (__=_0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.65) and cognitive participation (__=_0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.58). Intention to use mRDT score was 6.85__nits higher among health workers with three or more years of experience compared to those with less than 3 years of experience (__=_6.85 95% CI 0.59-13.12). However, intention to use mRDT score was inversely related to reflexive monitoring and collective action but not significant. CONCLUSION: The study identified that intention to use mRDT was positively influenced by health workers having a proper understanding of the aims and expected benefits (coherence) of the intervention and the availability of experienced staff and intervention champions (cognitive participation) to promote mRDT use among health workers.",,,6,,,
1221,"Food consumption and its impact on cardiovascular disease: importance of solutions focused on the globalized food system: A report from the workshop convened by the world heart federation Major scholars in the field, on the basis of a 3-day consensus, created an in-depth review of current knowledge on the role of diet in cardiovascular disease (CVD), the changing global food system and global dietary patterns, and potential policy solutions. Evidence from different countries and age/race/ethnicity/socioeconomic groups suggesting the health effects studies of foods, macronutrients, and dietary patterns on CVD appear to be far more consistent though regional knowledge gaps is highlighted. Large gaps in knowledge about the association of macronutrients to CVD in low- and middle-income countries particularly linked with dietary patterns are reviewed. Our understanding of foods and macronutrients in relationship to CVD is broadly clear; however, major gaps exist both in dietary pattern research and ways to change diets and food systems. On the basis of the current evidence, the traditional Mediterranean-type diet, including plant foods and emphasis on plant protein sources provides a well-tested healthy dietary pattern to reduce CVD.

1222,"A qualitative study of Thai HIV-positive young men who have sex with men and transgender women demonstrates the need for eHealth interventions to optimize the HIV care continuum In Thailand, young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women (TG) are disproportionately affected by HIV and have suboptimal care continuum outcomes. Although Thai YMSM and young TG are early adopters of emerging technologies and have high Internet and technology access and utilization, the potential of technology has not been harnessed to optimize the HIV treatment cascade. We interviewed 18 behaviorally HIV-infected YMSM and young TG regarding care challenges, identified how eHealth could address care needs, and elicited preferences for eHealth interventions. Participants reported struggling with individual and societal-level stigma which negatively impacted linkage to and retention in care, and antiretroviral therapy adherence. YMSM and young TG described inadequate in-person support services and heavily relied on random online resources to fill information and support gaps, but sometimes viewed them as untrustworthy or inconsistent. Participants universally endorsed the development of eHealth resources and proposed how they could ameliorate individual-level fears over stigma and improve public perceptions about HIV. Personalized and integrated eHealth interventions with interactive, user-driven structures, credible content, rewards for engagement, real-time counseling and reminder support could help overcome barriers YMSM and young TG face in traditional HIV healthcare systems and have the potential to improve care outcomes.",,,6,,,
1223,"Variation in treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases at major referral centers in the United States We performed a prospective study of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to examine variations in treatment among medical centers. In a prospective cohort study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers, controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65).

1224,"The benefit of combination therapy depends on disease phenotype and duration in Crohn's disease BACKGROUND: The impact of combination therapy on disease-related morbidity in patients with established Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) remains to be well-defined. AIM: To examine the effect of combination therapy on disease outcomes in CD and UC. METHODS: Using a multicenter prospective cohort, we classified CD and UC patients as being on monotherapy with anti-TNF or on combination with an immunomodulator. The primary outcome was a composite of new IBD-related surgery, hospitalisations, penetrating complications, need for corticosteroids or new biological at 1 year. Multivariable regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: We included 707 patients with CD (45% combination therapy) and 164 with UC (38% combination therapy). Combination therapy was not associated with reduction in the composite outcome in either CD (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.63-1.22) or UC (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63-3.38). However, while no difference was noted in those with nonstricturing, nonpenetrating CD, a significant reduction in the likelihood of the outcome was seen in those with stricturing or penetrating CD (30% vs 39%, OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.90). A stronger effect was also observed in those with disease duration < 5 years (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14-0.87) compared to those with a longer duration (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.45-1.27). A similar reduction in occurrence of composite outcome was noted with infliximab and with other anti-TNF biologics. CONCLUSION: The benefit of combination immunomodulator-biological therapy is stronger in those with complicated Crohn's disease, particularly early on in their disease course. _ 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,3,,,
1225,"Geographic heterogeneity in the prevalence of human papillomavirus in head and neck cancer Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), although strongly divergent results have been reported regarding the prevalence of HPV16 in different countries, whether this represents important differences in etiology remains unclear. Applying rigorous protocols for sample processing, we centrally evaluated 1,420 head and neck tumors (533 oropharynx, 395 oral cavity and 482 larynx) from studies conducted in the US, Europe and Brazil for mucosal HPV DNA and p16INK4a expression to evaluate regional heterogeneity in the proportion of HPV16-associated OPSCC and other head and neck cancer, and to assess covariates associated with the risk of HPV16-positive OPSCC. While majority of OPSCC in the US (60%) were HPV16-positive, this proportion was 31% in Europe and only 4% in Brazil (p_< _0.01). Similar differences were observed for other head and neck tumors, ranging from 7% in the US and 5% in Europe, to 0% in South America. The odds of HPV16-positive OPSCC declined with increasing pack years of smoking (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64-0.87) and drink years of alcohol use (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54-0.76). These results suggest that while the contribution of HPV16 is substantial for the oropharynx, it remains limited for oral cavity and laryngeal cancers. _ 2017 IARC/WHO.",,,3,,,
1226,"Validity of state cancer registry treatment information for adolescent and young adult women BACKGROUND: Population-based cancer registries collect information on first course of treatment that may be utilized in research on cancer care quality, yet few studies have investigated the validity of this information. We examined the accuracy and completeness of registry-based treatment information in a cohort of adolescent and young adult women. METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, cervical/uterine cancer or ovarian cancer at ages 15-39 during 2003-2014 were identified using data from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (CCR) (N_=_2342). CCR data were linked to Medicaid and private insurance claims data, and claims were reviewed for the 12 months following diagnosis to identify cancer treatments received. Using claims data as the gold standard, we calculated the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of CCR data for receipt of chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapy. We also compared dates of treatment initiation between the two data sources. RESULTS: For all cancer types combined, the sensitivity of the CCR data was high for chemotherapy (86%) and moderate for radiation (74%). PPVs were 82% and 83% for chemotherapy and radiation, respectively. Both the sensitivity (67%) and PPV (70%) were lower for hormone therapy for breast cancer. For all three treatment types, dates of initiation in the registry and the claims differed by _30 days for most women. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of young women, population-based cancer registry data on chemotherapy receipt was reasonably accurate and complete in comparison with insurance claims. Radiation and hormone therapy appeared to be less complete. Copyright _ 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,3,,,
1227,"Acceptability and ease of use of mailed HPV self-collection among infrequently screened women in North Carolina OBJECTIVES: Self-collection of cervico-vaginal samples for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has the potential to make cervical cancer screening more accessible to underscreened women. We evaluated the acceptability and ease of use of home-based HPV self-collection within a diverse population of low-income, infrequently screened women. METHODS: Participants were low-income women from North Carolina who had not received Pap testing in 4 or more years. Eligible women received a self-collection kit containing instructions and a brush for home-based sample collection. A total of 227 women returned a self-collected sample by mail and completed a questionnaire to assess their experiences with HPV self-collection. We described acceptability measures and used logistic regression to identify predictors of overall positive thoughts about the self-collection experience. RESULTS: Nearly all women were willing to perform HPV self-collection again (98%) and were comfortable receiving the self-collection kit in the mail (99%). Overall, 81% of participants reported positive thoughts about home-based self-collection. Women with at least some college education and those who were divorced, separated or widowed were more likely to report overall positive thoughts. Aspects of self-collection that participants most commonly reported liking included convenience (53%), ease of use (32%) and privacy (23%). The most frequently reported difficulties included uncertainty that the self-collection was done correctly (16%) and difficulty inserting the self-collection brush (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Home-based self-collection for HPV was a highly acceptable screening method among low-income, underscreened women and holds the promise to increase access to cervical cancer screening in this high-risk population. _ Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

1228,"Birth rates after radioactive iodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer Treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) for differentiated thyroid cancer has been associated with alterations in gonadal function in women, including changes in menstrual function and an earlier age at menopause. Our objective was to evaluate associations between RAI and postdiagnosis live birth rates among thyroid cancer survivors diagnosed at ages 15-39 years. We identified women diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer between January 2000 and December 2013 in the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (CCR). CCR records were linked to state birth certificate files to identify livebirths to thyroid cancer survivors through December 2014. Person-years of follow-up were accrued from 6 months after diagnosis to first birth, 46th birthday, death, or December 31, 2014, whichever came first. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for first livebirth. Among 2,360 women with a differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosis, 53% received RAI. The cumulative incidence of birth at the end of follow-up (maximum 14.5 years) was 30.0 and 29.3% among those who were and were not treated with RAI, respectively. Overall, first birth rates did not significantly differ between groups (HR_=_1.00; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.23). In our observational cohort, treatment with RAI was not associated with a reduced birth rate. Our findings add to the evidence available for counseling thyroid cancer patients with concerns about future fertility. _ 2017 UICC.",,,3,,,
1229,"Disparities in Mortality from Noncancer Causes among Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined noncancer outcomes among patients diagnosed with cancer as adolescents and young adults (AYA). We examined risk of mortality from noncancer causes after an AYA cancer diagnosis and investigated disparities according to race/ethnicity and other characteristics. METHODS: Patients with a first primary cancer at ages 15 to 39 years diagnosed during 1987 to 2015 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (N = 242,940 women, 158,347 men). Survival months were accrued from diagnosis until death or December 2015. Multivariable-adjusted HRs were used to examine disparities in mortality from all noncancer causes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and infectious diseases (ID) according to race/ethnicity, geographic region, and county-level characteristics. RESULTS: For all cancer types combined, the 10-year cumulative incidence of noncancer-related death after AYA cancer was 2% and 5% among women and men, respectively. With adjustment for cancer type, all noncancer mortality was increased among non-Hispanic Black AYAs [HR vs. non-Hispanic White: HRWomen = 2.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.16-2.47; HRMen = 2.17; 95% CI: 2.05-2.30] and those in the South (HR vs. Northeast: HRWomen = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.29; HRMen = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.31-1.55) or in rural counties (HR vs. metro: HRWomen = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.47-2.07; HRMen = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.33-1.86). Mortality from CVD and ID was also elevated among non-Hispanic Black AYAs. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that noncancer mortality after AYA cancer is highest among survivors who are non-Hispanic Black or live in the South or in rural counties. IMPACT: Our analyses highlight disparities among AYAs with cancer and identify subgroups that may be targeted for increased medical surveillance or behavioral interventions. _2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",,,3,,,
1230,"Noncancer mortality among adolescents and young adults with cancer BACKGROUND: Relative to the general population, cancer patients and survivors may have an elevated risk of mortality from noncancer causes, such as cardiovascular disease and infections, but few studies have examined rates of noncancer mortality among patients diagnosed as adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (ages 15-39_years). METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify AYA patients who were diagnosed with a first malignant cancer between 1973 and 2015. Rates of mortality from noncancer causes among AYAs with cancer were compared with those in the general US population using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), adjusted for age, sex, race, and calendar year. RESULTS: Among 235,541 AYAs with cancer, a total of 12,948 deaths from noncancer causes occurred over 3.1_million total person-years of follow-up. Overall, noncancer mortality was significantly increased among AYAs with cancer relative to the general population (SMR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.80-1.87). SMRs were particularly elevated for infectious diseases (SMR, 5.13; 95% CI, 4.95-5.32), cardiovascular disease (SMR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.50-1.60), and renal diseases (SMR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.12-2.71). These associations persisted for more than 20_years after cancer diagnosis. Cancer types associated with the highest SMRs for all noncancer mortality included leukemias (SMR, 5.26), Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR, 3.12), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR, 6.33), central nervous system tumors (SMR, 3.38), head and neck cancers (SMR, 2.09), and cervical/uterine cancers (SMR, 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: AYAs with cancer have an elevated burden of mortality from noncancer causes that persists many years after cancer diagnosis, highlighting the importance of comprehensive, long-term follow-up care for noncancer conditions throughout survivorship. _ 2019 American Cancer Society.",,,3,,,
1231,"Endocrine Therapy Initiation and Medical Oncologist Utilization Among Women Diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma in Situ BACKGROUND: Though randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a reduction in second breast events with endocrine therapy among women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), use of these therapies remains highly variable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient and treatment-related factors associated with endocrine therapy initiation and medical oncology specialty utilization after DCIS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified women with a DCIS diagnosis during 2006-2010 in the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry with linked public and private insurance claims in the University of North Carolina Integrated Cancer Information Surveillance System data resource. Multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for endocrine therapy initiation in the year following DCIS diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 2,090 women with a DCIS diagnosis, 37% initiated endocrine therapy. Initiation was less common among women aged 75+ at diagnosis (RR_=_0.79; 95% CI: 0.64-0.97 vs. age 45-54) and women treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) who did not receive radiation (RR_=_0.63; 95% CI: 0.50-0.78 vs. BCS plus radiation). Consultation with a medical oncologist was strongly associated with endocrine therapy initiation (RR_=_1.40; 95% CI: 1.23-1.61). Women who saw a medical oncologist more often had private insurance, higher census tract-level income, hormone receptor positive disease, and treatment with BCS and radiation. CONCLUSION: Treatment strategies for DCIS remain controversial. Our data suggest that endocrine therapy is more often used in addition to standard therapies such as BCS plus radiation, rather than as an alternative to radiation. The Oncologist 2017;22:535-541 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Randomized trials have demonstrated a reduction in second breast cancer events with use of endocrine therapy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, notable variation exists in the uptake of these therapies among DCIS patients. In this study, factors associated with endocrine therapy initiation in the year following a DCIS diagnosis included consultation with a medical oncologist and treatment with breast-conserving surgery with radiation. Our findings help to explain the wide variation in endocrine therapy initiation and suggest the need for clear guidelines in the treatment of DCIS. _ AlphaMed Press 2017.",,,3,,,
1232,"Dietary Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load Are Positively Associated with Oxidative Stress among Premenopausal Women Background: Diets with a high glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) have been hypothesized to increase oxidative stress, but the limited human studies are inconsistent. Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate associations between dietary GI, GL, and carbohydrate intake and oxidative stress, as measured by F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs). Methods: Concentrations of F2-IsoP and its metabolite (15-F2t-IsoP-M) were measured in urine samples collected at enrollment from 866 premenopausal women (aged 35-54 y) participating in the Sister Study. Total carbohydrate intake and dietary GI and GL were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Urinary F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations were compared across quintiles of carbohydrate intake, GI, and GL using multivariable linear regression models. Results: Urinary F2-IsoP concentrations were positively associated with dietary GI (P-trend = 0.023), and both F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations were positively associated with GL (F2-IsoP: P-trend < 0.001; 15-F2t-IsoP-M: P-trend < 0.001) and total carbohydrate intake (F2-IsoP: P-trend = 0.012; 15-F2t-IsoP-M: P-trend < 0.001). Stratified analyses suggested that a positive association between GI and urinary 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations was present among women with a body mass index [BMI (in kg/m2)] _30.0, but not among those with a BMI of < 25.0 or 25.0-29.9 (P-interaction = 0.01). Conclusions: Our cross-sectional analyses in a sample of premenopausal women support hypothesized relations between high dietary GI and GL and oxidative stress, as assessed by urinary F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations. Given potential associations between oxidative stress and the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, our findings may have important implications for reducing chronic disease risk.

1233,"Suicide rates among patients with cancers of the digestive system OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that suicide rates are elevated among cancer patients relative to the general population. In this analysis, we comprehensively evaluated characteristics associated with higher suicide rates among patients with cancers of the digestive system. METHODS: Using the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified all patients diagnosed with digestive system cancers during 2000 to 2014. Patients were classified as having died of suicide if their cause of death in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results was listed as ""suicide and self-inflicted injury."" Suicide rates were compared to age-, sex-, and race-adjusted rates in the general population. RESULTS: A total of 881 suicides were identified among 856_293 patients diagnosed with digestive system cancers. The suicide rate in this population was 32.8 per 100_000 person-years and was nearly twice that in the general population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]_=_1.91; 95% CI, 1.79-2.04). Suicide rates were significantly elevated for all cancer sites but were highest for esophageal (SMR_=_5.03), pancreatic (SMR_=_5.28), stomach (SMR_=_2.84), and liver (SMR_=_2.14) cancers. Standardized mortality ratios for suicide were highest within the first 5_years of diagnosis and increased with age at diagnosis for all sites except colon and stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancers of the digestive system have a higher incidence of suicide than the general population. Suicide rates among esophageal and pancreatic cancer patients are more than 5_times general population rates. The involvement of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may be a critical component of cancer care for these high-risk patient subgroups. _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,3,,,
1234,"Age- and treatment-related associations with health behavior change among breast cancer survivors OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify demographic and treatment-related factors associated with health-promoting behavior changes after a breast cancer diagnosis. Changes in health behaviors were also evaluated according to weight, exercise, diet and alcohol consumption patterns before breast cancer diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined self-reported behavior changes among 1415 women diagnosed with breast cancer in the NIEHS Sister Study cohort. Women reported changes in exercising, eating healthy foods, maintaining a healthy body weight, drinking alcohol, smoking, getting enough sleep, spending time with family and friends, and participating in breast cancer awareness events. RESULTS: On average, women were 3.7 years from their breast cancer diagnosis. Overall, 20-36% reported positive changes in exercise, eating healthy foods, maintaining a healthy weight, or alcohol consumption. However, 17% exercised less. With each 5-year increase in diagnosis age, women were 11-16% less likely to report positive change in each of these behaviors (OR_=_0.84-0.89; p_< _0.05), except alcohol consumption (OR_=_0.97; CI: 0.81, 1.17). Women who underwent chemotherapy were more likely to report eating more healthy foods (OR_=_1.47; 95% CI 1.16-1.86), drinking less alcohol (OR_=_2.01; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.06), and sleeping enough (OR_=_1.41; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.91). The majority of women (50-84%) reported no change in exercise, eating healthy foods, efforts to maintain a healthy weight, alcohol consumption, sleep patterns, or time spent with family or friends.

1235,"Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for preterm delivery among adolescent and young adult cancer survivors PURPOSE: A cancer diagnosis in adolescence and young adulthood (AYA, ages 15-39) may affect future pregnancy outcomes. Previous studies have reported an increased risk of preterm delivery (< _37 weeks of gestation) after maternal cancer treatment. In this analysis, we evaluated whether non-cancer characteristics modify the association between an AYA cancer history and preterm birth. METHODS: North Carolina Central Cancer Registry records (2000-2013) were linked to state birth certificate files (2000-2014) to identify births to AYA cancer survivors (n_=_1,980). A comparison cohort of births to women without a cancer diagnosis was selected from birth certificate files (n_=_11,860). Log-binomial regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for preterm delivery. Effect modification by early prenatal care (1st trimester; yes/no), race/ethnicity (white/black/other), previous live births (0/1+), maternal age (< _25/25-29/30-34/35+), smoking during pregnancy (any/none), and education (high school or less/some college/Bachelor's degree or higher) was evaluated using likelihood ratio tests (LRT). RESULTS: Overall, preterm births were more common among AYA survivors than the comparison group (RR_=_1.24, CI 1.07-1.43). The association was stronger among those who did not receive early prenatal care (RR_=_1.73, CI 1.26-2.37) than among those who did (RR_=_1.15, CI 0.98-1.35; LRT p_=_0.03). Maternal age_< _25 was also associated with a greater increase in preterm birth (< _25: RR_=_1.80, CI 1.27-2.54; LRT p_=_0.07). Associations did not vary strongly by other factors evaluated.

1237,"Implementation Lessons Learned From the Benefits of Enhanced Terminal Room (BETR) Disinfection Study: Process and Perceptions of Enhanced Disinfection with Ultraviolet Disinfection Devices OBJECTIVE To summarize and discuss logistic and administrative challenges we encountered during the Benefits of Enhanced Terminal Room (BETR) Disinfection Study and lessons learned that are pertinent to future utilization of ultraviolet (UV) disinfection devices in other hospitals DESIGN Multicenter cluster randomized trial SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Nine hospitals in the southeastern United States METHODS All participating hospitals developed systems to implement 4 different strategies for terminal room disinfection. We measured compliance with disinfection strategy, barriers to implementation, and perceptions from nurse managers and environmental services (EVS) supervisors throughout the 28-month trial. RESULTS Implementation of enhanced terminal disinfection with UV disinfection devices provides unique challenges, including time pressures from bed control personnel, efficient room identification, negative perceptions from nurse managers, and discharge volume. In the course of the BETR Disinfection Study, we utilized several strategies to overcome these barriers: (1) establishing safety as the priority; (2) improving communication between EVS, bed control, and hospital administration; (3) ensuring availability of necessary resources; and (4) tracking and providing feedback on compliance. Using these strategies, we deployed ultraviolet (UV) disinfection devices in 16,220 (88%) of 18,411 eligible rooms during our trial (median per hospital, 89%; IQR, 86%-92%). CONCLUSIONS Implementation of enhanced terminal room disinfection strategies using UV devices requires recognition and mitigation of 2 key barriers: (1) timely and accurate identification of rooms that would benefit from enhanced terminal disinfection and (2) overcoming time constraints to allow EVS cleaning staff sufficient time to properly employ enhanced terminal disinfection methods.

1238,"Identification of novel risk factors for community-acquired Clostridium difficile infection using spatial statistics and geographic information system analyses BACKGROUND: The rate of community-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (CA-CDI) is increasing. While receipt of antibiotics remains an important risk factor for CDI, studies related to acquisition of C. difficile outside of hospitals are lacking. As a result, risk factors for exposure to C. difficile in community settings have been inadequately studied. MAIN OBJECTIVE: To identify novel environmental risk factors for CA-CDI. METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients with CA-CDI from 1/1/2007 through 12/31/2014 in a 10-county area in central North Carolina. 360 Census Tracts in these 10 counties were used as the demographic Geographic Information System (GIS) base-map. Longitude and latitude (X, Y) coordinates were generated from patient home addresses and overlaid to Census Tracts polygons using ArcGIS; ArcView was used to assess ""hot-spots"" or clusters of CA-CDI. We then constructed a mixed hierarchical model to identify environmental variables independently associated with increased rates of CA-CDI. RESULTS: A total of 1,895 unique patients met our criteria for CA-CDI. The mean patient age was 54.5 years; 62% were female and 70% were Caucasian. 402 (21%) patient addresses were located in ""hot spots"" or clusters of CA-CDI (p< 0.001). ""Hot spot"" census tracts were scattered throughout the 10 counties. After adjusting for clustering and population density, age _ 60 years (p = 0.03), race (< 0.001), proximity to a livestock farm (0.01), proximity to farming raw materials services (0.02), and proximity to a nursing home (0.04) were independently associated with increased rates of CA-CDI. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to use spatial statistics and mixed models to identify important environmental risk factors for acquisition of C. difficile and adds to the growing evidence that farm practices may put patients at risk for important drug-resistant infections.",,,3,,,
1239,"Clonal sequences recovered from plasma from patients with residual HIV-1 viremia and on intensified antiretroviral therapy are identical to replicating viral RNAs recovered from circulating resting CD4+ T cells Despite successful antiretroviral therapy (ART), low-level viremia (LLV) may be intermittently detected in most HIV-infected patients. Longitudinal blood plasma and resting CD4(+) T cells were obtained from two patients on suppressive ART to investigate the source of LLV. Single-genome sequencing of HIV-1 env from LLV plasma was performed, and the sequences were compared to sequences recovered from limiting-dilution outgrowth assays of resting CD4(+) T cells. The circulating LLV virus clone was identical to virus recovered from outgrowth assays from pools of millions of resting CD4(+) T cells. Understanding the sources of LLV requires evaluation of all possible reservoirs of persistent HIV infection.",,,5,,,
1240,"HIV-1 Populations in Semen Arise through Multiple Mechanisms HIV-1 is present in anatomical compartments and bodily fluids. Most transmissions occur through sexual acts, making virus in semen the proximal source in male donors. We find three distinct relationships in comparing viral RNA populations between blood and semen in men with chronic HIV-1 infection, and we propose that the viral populations in semen arise by multiple mechanisms including: direct import of virus, oligoclonal amplification within the seminal tract, or compartmentalization. In addition, we find significant enrichment of six out of nineteen cytokines and chemokines in semen of both HIV-infected and uninfected men, and another seven further enriched in infected individuals. The enrichment of cytokines involved in innate immunity in the seminal tract, complemented with chemokines in infected men, creates an environment conducive to T cell activation and viral replication. These studies define different relationships between virus in blood and semen that can significantly alter the composition of the viral population at the source that is most proximal to the transmitted virus.",,,6,,,
1241,"Factors Associated With Shorter Colonoscopy Surveillance Intervals for Patients With Low-Risk Colorectal Adenomas and Effects on Outcome BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopists do not routinely follow guidelines to survey individuals with low-risk adenomas (LRAs; 1-2 small tubular adenomas, < 1 cm) every 5-10 years for colorectal cancer; many recommend shorter surveillance intervals for these individuals. We aimed to identify the reasons that endoscopists recommend shorter surveillance intervals for some individuals with LRAs and determine whether timing affects outcomes at follow-up examinations. METHODS: We collected data from 1560 individuals (45-75 years old) who participated in a prospective chemoprevention trial (of vitamin D and calcium) from 2004 through 2008. Participants in the trial had at least 1 adenoma, detected at their index colonoscopy, and were recommended to receive follow-up colonoscopy examinations at 3 or 5 years after adenoma identification, as recommended by the endoscopist. For this analysis we collected data from only participants with LRAs. These data included characteristics of participants and endoscopists and findings from index and follow-up colonoscopies. Primary endpoints were frequency of recommending shorter (3-year) vs longer (5-year) surveillance intervals, factors associated with these recommendations, and effect on outcome, determined at the follow-up colonoscopy. RESULTS: A 3-year surveillance interval was recommended for 594 of the subjects (38.1%). Factors most significantly associated with recommendation of 3-year vs a 5-year surveillance interval included African American race (relative risk [RR] to white, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.75), Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity (RR to white, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.22-2.43), detection of 2 adenomas at the index examination (RR vs 1 adenoma, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.71), more than 3 serrated polyps at the index examination (RR=2.16, 95% CI, 1.59-2.93), or index examination with fair or poor quality bowel preparation (RR vs excellent quality, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.66-2.83). Other factors that had a significant association with recommendation for a 3-year surveillance interval included family history of colorectal cancer and detection of 1-2 serrated polyps at the index examination. In comparisons of outcomes, we found no significant differences between the 3-year vs 5-year recommendation groups in proportions of subjects found to have 1 or more adenomas (38.8% vs 41.7% respectively; P_=_.27), advanced adenomas (7.7% vs 8.2%; P_=_.73) or clinically significant serrated polyps (10.0% vs 10.3%; P_= .82) at the follow-up colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Possibly influenced by patients' family history, race, quality of bowel preparation, or number or size of polyps, endoscopists frequently recommend 3-year surveillance intervals instead of guideline-recommended intervals of 5 years or longer for individuals with LRAs. However, at the follow-up colonoscopy, similar proportions of participants have 1 or more adenomas, advanced adenomas, or serrated polyps. These findings support the current guideline recommendations of performing follow-up examinations of individuals with LRAs at least 5 years after the index colonoscopy.

1243,"Cognitive interviews to improve a patient-centered contraceptive effectiveness poster OBJECTIVES: To refine the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s contraceptive education poster using patient-centered design. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted cognitive interviews with 26 women aged 18-44 living in North Carolina who spoke and read English and had ever had sex. We interviewed women about both a CDC and a patient-centered poster in alternating order. Participants were contraceptive users and non-users that we selected purposively to have a range of characteristics that might influence their perspective: age, race/ethnicity, previous births and pregnancies, contraceptive method(s) used in the past three months, pregnancy intentions, and numeracy. The initial response rate for participants was 55%. We used cognitive theory to code interviews for comprehension, relevance, and acceptability, as well as design and overall preference. We structured the 26 interviews into four rounds and revised the patient-centered poster after each round to improve these measures. RESULTS: By the final round, 83% of women preferred the patient-centered poster. The majority of women favored this poster's relevance (86%), and design (100%) and ease of comprehension (86%). Women raised few concerns about the acceptability of the final version of the patient-centered poster. Women identified many issues with both posters that the researchers did not anticipate, highlighting the value of patient-centered design approaches to educational materials. CONCLUSIONS: This study refined a patient-centered poster so that its language is clear and it addresses the informational needs of its target audience. IMPLICATIONS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Population Affairs recommend that clinicians educate women about contraception. This study developed a poster that could help clinicians follow this recommendation. Before widespread implementation, more research is needed to evaluate the poster's impact on contraceptive knowledge and behaviors. Copyright _ 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,5,,,
1244,"Effects of two educational posters on contraceptive knowledge and intentions: A randomized controlled trial OBJECTIVE: To compare the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) contraceptive effectiveness poster with a more patient-centered poster on factors affecting the likelihood of using effective contraceptives. METHODS: The posters were tested in a randomized controlled trial. Women were eligible if they were aged 18-44 years, could speak and read English, were not pregnant or trying to conceive, and had engaged in vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months. An online survey administered through Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to collect baseline and immediate follow-up data on three primary outcomes: contraceptive knowledge (measured using the Contraceptive Knowledge Assessment), perceived pregnancy risk, and the effectiveness of the contraceptive the woman intended to use in the next year. Subgroup analyses were conducted in women with prior pregnancy scares, low numeracy, and no current contraceptive. Within- and between-group differences were compared for the two randomized groups. RESULTS: From January 26 to February 13, 2018, 2,930 people were screened and 990 randomized. For the primary outcomes, the only significant result was that the patient-centered poster produced a greater improvement in contraceptive knowledge than the CDC poster (P< .001). Relative to baseline, both posters significantly improved contraceptive knowledge (CDC +3.6, patient-centered +6.4 percentage points, P< .001) and a constructed score measuring the effectiveness of the contraceptive that women intended to use in the next year (CDC and patient-centered +3 percentage points, P< .01). This is equivalent to 1-17 of every 100 women who viewed a poster changing their intentions in favor of a more effective contraceptive. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that both posters educate women about contraception and may reduce unplanned pregnancy risk by improving contraceptive intentions. Of the three primary outcomes, the patient-centered poster performs significantly better than the CDC poster at increasing contraceptive knowledge.

1245,"Obesity and depressed mood associations differ by race/ethnicity in adolescent girls Objectives. To evaluate bidirectional associations between obesity and depressed mood in adolescent girls, and determine if associations differed by racial/ethnic group. Methods. We analyzed data collected from 918 adolescent girls studied in 6(th) and 8(th) grades in the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG). Racial/ethnic group was defined as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic. Height and weight were measured and obesity was defined as a body mass index-for-age _95(th) percentile. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depressive symptoms and depressed mood, defined as CES-D _24. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations between 6(th) grade obesity and 8(th) grade depressed mood, as well as 6(th) grade depressed mood and 8(th) grade obesity. Results. Racial/ethnic group was a statistically significant effect modifier in both directions of association (p< 0.02). Among white girls, 6(th) grade obesity was associated with greater likelihood of depressed mood in 8(th) grade (odds ratio [OR]=2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.85, 3.30), whereas for black and Hispanic girls this association was not observed (OR= 1.16 and 0.82, respectively). Also for white girls, 6(th) grade depressed mood was associated with greater likelihood of obesity in 8(th) grade (OR = 4.47, CI: 1.96, 10.24), whereas for black and Hispanic girls, OR=0.83 and 1.89, respectively. Conclusions. Associations between obesity and depressed mood may be most problematic among adolescent girls in the white racial/ethnic group. Our results are consistent both with depressed mood contributing to obesity and obesity contributing to depressed mood.",,,9,,,
1246,"Variability in objective and subjective measures affects baseline values in studies of patients with COPD RATIONALE: Understanding the reliability and repeatability of clinical measurements used in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of disease progression is of critical importance across all disciplines of clinical practice and in clinical trials to assess therapeutic efficacy and safety. OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to understand normal variability for assessing true changes in health status and to more accurately utilize this data to differentiate disease characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: Our study is the first study designed entirely to establish the repeatability of a large number of instruments utilized for the clinical assessment of COPD in the same subjects over the same period. We utilized SPIROMICS participants (n = 98) that returned to their clinical center within 6 weeks of their baseline visit to repeat complete baseline assessments. Demographics, spirometry, questionnaires, complete blood cell counts (CBC), medical history, and emphysema status by computerized tomography (CT) imaging were obtained. RESULTS: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were highly repeatable (ICC's >0.9) but the 6 minute walk (6MW) was less so (ICC = 0.79). Among questionnaires, the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was most repeatable. Self-reported clinical features, such as exacerbation history, and features of chronic bronchitis, often produced kappa values < 0.6. Reported age at starting smoking and average number of cigarettes smoked were modestly repeatable (kappa = 0.76 and 0.79). Complete blood counts (CBC) variables produced intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) values between 0.6 and 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: PFTs were highly repeatable, while subjective measures and subject recall were more variable. Analyses using features with poor repeatability could lead to misclassification and outcome errors. Hence, care should be taken when interpreting change in clinical features based on measures with low repeatability. Efforts to improve repeatability of key clinical features such as exacerbation history and chronic bronchitis are warranted.",,,1,,,
1247,"Analysis of Individuals from a Dengue-Endemic Region Helps Define the Footprint and Repertoire of Antibodies Targeting Dengue Virus 3 Type-Specific Epitopes The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to 4) cause dengue, a major public health problem worldwide. Individuals exposed to primary DENV infections develop serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, including strongly neutralizing antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes. To date, no studies have measured the levels and kinetics of serum antibodies directed to such epitopes among populations in regions where dengue is endemic. Here, we use a recombinant DENV4 (rDENV4/3-M14) displaying a major DENV3 type-specific quaternary epitope recognized by human monoclonal antibody 5J7 to measure the proportion, magnitude, and kinetics of DENV3 type-specific neutralizing antibody responses targeting this epitope. Primary DENV3 sera from 30 individuals in a dengue hospital-based study in Nicaragua were studied 3, 6, 12, and 18_months post-infection, alongside samples collected annually 1 to 4_years post-primary DENV3 infection from 10 individuals in a cohort study in Nicaragua. We found substantial individual variation in the proportion of DENV3 type-specific neutralizing antibody titers attributed to the 5J7 epitope (range, 0 to 100%), with the mean significantly increasing from 22.6% to 41.4% from 3 to 18_months. We extended the transplanted DENV3 5J7 epitope on the virion (rDENV4/3-M16), resulting in increased recognition in several individuals, helping define the footprint of the epitope. However, 37% and 13% of the subjects still showed little to no recognition of the 5J7 epitope at 3 and 18_months, respectively, indicating that one or more additional DENV3 type-specific epitopes exist. Overall, this study demonstrates how DENV-immune plasma from populations from areas of endemicity, when coupled with structurally guided recombinant viruses, can help characterize the epitope-specific neutralizing antibody response in natural DENV infections, with direct implications for design and evaluation of dengue vaccines.IMPORTANCE The four serotypes of dengue virus cause dengue, a major public health burden worldwide, yet it has been challenging to develop a vaccine that is safe and equally effective against all four serotypes. More in-depth characterization of natural human neutralizing antibody responses is needed to identify determinants of protective antibody responses to all DENV serotypes. Here, we use hospital and cohort studies in a region where dengue is endemic to assess the proportion and kinetics of the DENV3 neutralizing antibody response directed to a quaternary epitope on DENV3 recognized by strongly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 5J7, which was transplanted into a DENV4 backbone. We show that many individuals recognized the 5J7 epitope, but to various degrees over time, suggesting that additional DENV3-specific epitopes likely exist. Thus, characterization of epitope-specific neutralizing antibody responses in natural DENV infections can help define the footprint and repertoire of antibodies directed to DENV3 type-specific epitopes, with implications for dengue vaccine development.

1248,"Drug-induced liver injury Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an adverse reaction to drugs or other xenobiotics that occurs either as a predictable event when an individual is exposed to toxic doses of some compounds or as an unpredictable event with many drugs in common use. Drugs can be harmful to the liver in susceptible individuals owing to genetic and environmental risk factors. These risk factors modify hepatic metabolism and excretion of the DILI-causative agent leading to cellular stress, cell death, activation of an adaptive immune response and a failure to adapt, with progression to overt liver injury. Idiosyncratic DILI is a relative rare hepatic disorder but can be severe and, in some cases, fatal, presenting with a variety of phenotypes, which mimic other hepatic diseases. The diagnosis of DILI relies on the exclusion of other aetiologies of liver disease as specific biomarkers are still lacking. Clinical scales such as CIOMS/RUCAM can support the diagnostic process but need refinement. A number of clinical variables, validated in prospective cohorts, can be used to predict a more severe DILI outcome. Although no pharmacological therapy has been adequately tested in randomized clinical trials, corticosteroids can be useful, particularly in the emergent form of DILI related to immune-checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer.",,,1,,,
1249,"Hyper-Methylated Loci Persisting from Sessile Serrated Polyps to Serrated Cancers Although serrated polyps were historically considered to pose little risk, it is now understood that progression down the serrated pathway could account for as many as 15%-35% of colorectal cancers. The sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P) is the most prevalent pre-invasive serrated lesion. Our objective was to identify the CpG loci that are persistently hyper-methylated during serrated carcinogenesis, from the early SSA/P lesion through the later cancer phases of neoplasia development. We queried the loci hyper-methylated in serrated cancers within our rightsided SSA/Ps from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry, using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 k panel to comprehensively assess the DNA methylation status. We identified CpG loci and regions consistently hyper-methylated throughout the serrated carcinogenesis spectrum, in both our SSA/P specimens and in serrated cancers. Hyper-methylated CpG loci included the known the tumor suppressor gene RET (p = 5.72 x 10-10), as well as loci in differentially methylated regions for GSG1L, MIR4493, NTNG1, MCIDAS, ZNF568, and RERG. The hyper-methylated loci that we identified help characterize the biology of SSA/P development, and could be useful as therapeutic targets, or for future identification of patients who may benefit from shorter surveillance intervals.",,,8,,,

1251,"Ensuring respect for persons in COMPASS: a cluster randomised pragmatic clinical trial Cluster randomised clinical trials present unique challenges in meeting ethical obligations to those who are treated at a randomised site. Obtaining informed consent for research within the context of clinical care is one such challenge. In order to solve this problem it is important that an informed consent process be effective and efficient, and that it does not impede the research or the healthcare. The innovative approach to informed consent employed in the COMPASS study demonstrates the feasibility of upholding ethical standards without imposing undue burden on clinical workflows, staff members or patients who may participate in the research by virtue of their presence in a cluster randomised facility. The COMPASS study included 40 randomised sites and compared the effectiveness of a postacute stroke intervention with standard care. Each site provided either the comprehensive postacute stroke intervention or standard care according to the randomisation assignment. Working together, the study team, institutional review board and members of the community designed an ethically appropriate and operationally reasonable consent process which was carried out successfully at all randomised sites. This achievement is noteworthy because it demonstrates how to effectively conduct appropriate informed consent in cluster randomised trials, and because it provides a model that can easily be adapted for other pragmatic studies. With this innovative approach to informed consent, patients have access to the information they need about research occurring where they are seeking care, and medical researchers can conduct their studies without ethical concerns or unreasonable logistical impediments.

1252,"Feasibility of a Clinic-Community Partnership to Treat Childhood Obesity BACKGROUND: ""Bull City Fit"" is a childhood obesity treatment partnership between Duke Children's pediatric weight management clinic and Durham Department of Parks and Recreation. OBJECTIVES: Report on feasibility and implementation, characteristics of participants, and predictors of attendance. METHODS: Mixed methods study consisting of (1) a retrospective cohort analysis (n = 171) reporting demographic, attendance, and clinical data and (2) structured focus groups among stakeholders to identify implementation facilitators and barriers. RESULTS: Higher attendance was associated with Spanish language ( P = .07), more clinic visits ( P = .03), shorter time to first attendance ( P = .06), lower child z-body mass index (BMI) at baseline ( P = .08), and lower parent BMI ( P = .02). Associations were mitigated after controlling for demographic characteristics. BMI z-score did not differ between low- and moderate/high attenders at 6 months. Family inclusion and community engagement emerged as positive themes during focus groups.

1253,"Expression of paramyxovirus V proteins promotes replication and spread of hepatitis C virus in cultures of primary human fetal liver cells UNLABELLED: Here we demonstrate that primary cultures of human fetal liver cells (HFLC) reliably support infection with laboratory strains of hepatitis C virus (HCV), although levels of virus replication vary significantly between different donor cell preparations and frequently decline in a manner suggestive of active viral clearance. To investigate possible contributions of the interferon (IFN) system to control HCV infection in HFLC, we exploited the well-characterized ability of paramyxovirus (PMV) V proteins to counteract both IFN induction and antiviral signaling. The V proteins of measles virus (MV) and parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) were introduced into HFLC using lentiviral vectors encoding a fluorescent reporter for visualization of HCV-infected cells. V protein-transduced HFLC supported enhanced (10 to 100-fold) levels of HCV infection relative to untransduced or control vector-transduced HFLC. Infection was assessed by measurement of virus-driven luciferase, by assays for infectious HCV and viral RNA, and by direct visualization of HCV-infected hepatocytes. Live cell imaging between 48 and 119 hours postinfection demonstrated little or no spread of infection in the absence of PMV V protein expression. In contrast, V protein-transduced HFLC showed numerous HCV infection events. V protein expression efficiently antagonized the HCV-inhibitory effects of added IFNs in HFLC. In addition, induction of the type III IFN, IL29, following acute HCV infection was inhibited in V protein-transduced cultures. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that the cellular IFN response plays a significant role in limiting the spread of HCV infection in primary hepatocyte cultures. Strategies aimed at dampening this response may be key to further development of robust HCV culture systems, enabling studies of virus pathogenicity and the mechanisms by which HCV spreads in its natural host cell population.

1254,"An estimate of the global burden of anthropogenic ozone and fine particulate matter on premature human mortality using atmospheric modeling BACKGROUND: Ground-level concentrations of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter [< or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)] have increased since preindustrial times in urban and rural regions and are associated with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. OBJECTIVES: We estimated the global burden of mortality due to O3 and PM2.5 from anthropogenic emissions using global atmospheric chemical transport model simulations of preindustrial and present-day (2000) concentrations to derive exposure estimates. METHODS: Attributable mortalities were estimated using health impact functions based on long-term relative risk estimates for O3 and PM2.5 from the epidemiology literature. Using simulated concentrations rather than previous methods based on measurements allows the inclusion of rural areas where measurements are often unavailable and avoids making assumptions for background air pollution. RESULTS: Anthropogenic O3 was associated with an estimated 0.7 +/- 0.3 million respiratory mortalities (6.3 +/- 3.0 million years of life lost) annually. Anthropogenic PM2.5 was associated with 3.5 +/- 0.9 million cardiopulmonary and 220,000 +/- 80,000 lung cancer mortalities (30 +/- 7.6 million years of life lost) annually. Mortality estimates were reduced approximately 30% when we assumed low-concentration thresholds of 33.3 ppb for O3 and 5.8 microg/m3 for PM2.5. These estimates were sensitive to concentration thresholds and concentration-mortality relationships, often by > 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropogenic O3 and PM2.5 contribute substantially to global premature mortality. PM2.5 mortality estimates are about 50% higher than previous measurement-based estimates based on common assumptions, mainly because of methodologic differences. Specifically, we included rural populations, suggesting higher estimates; however, the coarse resolution of the global atmospheric model may underestimate urban PM(2.5) exposures.",,,5,,,
1255,"Impacts of global, regional, and sectoral black carbon emission reductions on surface air quality and human mortality Abstract. As a component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC) is associated with premature human mortality. BC also affects climate by absorbing solar radiation and reducing planetary albedo. Several studies have examined the climate impacts of BC emissions, but the associated health impacts have been studied less extensively. Here, we examine the surface PM2.5 and premature mortality impacts of halving anthropogenic BC emissions globally and individually from eight world regions and three major economic sectors. We use a global chemical transport model, MOZART-4, to simulate PM2.5 concentrations and a health impact function to calculate premature cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths. We estimate that halving global anthropogenic BC emissions reduces outdoor population-weighted average PM2.5 by 542 ng m_3 (1.8 %) and avoids 157 000 (95 % confidence interval, 120 000_194 000) annual premature deaths globally, with the vast majority occurring within the source region. Most of these avoided deaths can be achieved by halving emissions in East Asia (China; 54 %), followed by South Asia (India; 31 %), however South Asian emissions have 50 % greater mortality impacts per unit BC emitted than East Asian emissions. Globally, halving residential, industrial, and transportation emissions contributes 47 %, 35 %, and 15 % to the avoided deaths from halving all anthropogenic BC emissions. These contributions are 1.2, 1.2, and 0.6 times each sector's portion of global BC emissions, owing to the degree of co-location with population globally. We find that reducing BC emissions increases regional SO4 concentrations by up to 28 % of the magnitude of the regional BC concentration reductions, due to reduced absorption of radiation that drives photochemistry. Impacts of residential BC emissions are likely underestimated since indoor PM2.5 exposure is excluded. We estimate _8 times more avoided deaths when BC and organic carbon (OC) emissions are halved together, suggesting that these results greatly underestimate the full air pollution-related mortality benefits of BC mitigation strategies which generally decrease both BC and OC. The choice of concentration-response factor and health effect thresholds affects estimated global avoided deaths by as much as 56 % but does not strongly affect the regional distribution. Confidence in our results would be strengthened by reducing uncertainties in emissions, model parameterization of aerosol processes, grid resolution, and PM2.5 concentration-mortality relationships globally.",,,1,,,
1256,"Reducing Inequity in Urban Health: Have the Intra-urban Differentials in Reproductive Health Service Utilization and Child Nutritional Outcome Narrowed in Bangladesh? Bangladesh is undergoing a rapid urbanization process. About one-third of the population of major cities in the country live in slums, which are areas that exhibit pronounced concentrations of factors that negatively affect health and nutrition. People living in slums face greater challenge to improve their health than other parts of the country, which fuels the growing intra-urban health inequities. Two rounds of the Bangladesh Urban Health Survey (UHS), conducted in 2013 and 2006, were designed to examine the reproductive health status and service utilization between slum and non-slum residents. We applied an adaptation of the difference-in-differences (DID) model to pooled data from the 2006 and 2013 UHS rounds to examine changes over time in intra-urban differences between slums and non-slums in key health outcomes and service utilization and to identify the factors associated with the reduction in intra-urban gaps. In terms of change in intra-urban differentials during 2006-2013, DID regression analysis estimated that the gap between slums and non-slums for skilled birth attendant (SBA) during delivery significantly decreased. DID regression analysis also estimated that the gap between slums and non-slums for use of modern contraceptives among currently married women also narrowed significantly, and the gap reversed in favor of slums. However, the DID estimates indicate a small but not statistically significant reduction in the gap between slums and non-slums for child nutritional status. Results from extended DID regression model indicate that availability of community health workers in urban areas appears to have played a significant role in reducing the gap in SBA. The urban population in Bangladesh is expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades. Wide disparities between urban slums and non-slums can potentially push country performance off track during the post-2015 era, unless the specific health needs of the expanding slum communities are addressed. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic explanation and quantification of the role of various factors for improving intra-urban health equity in Bangladesh using nationally representative data. The findings provide a strong rationale for continuing and expanding community-based reproductive health services in urban areas by the NGOs with a focus on slum populations.",,,1,,,
1257,"Government of Malawi's unconditional cash transfer improves youth mental health We explore the impacts of Malawi's national unconditional cash transfer program targeting ultra-poor households on youth mental health. Experimental findings show that the program significantly improved mental health outcomes. Among girls in particular, the program reduces indications of depression by about 15 percentage points. We investigate the contribution of different possible pathways to the overall program impact, including education, health, consumption, caregiver's stress levels and life satisfaction, perceived social support, and participation in hard and unpleasant work. The pathways explain from 46 to 65 percent of the program impact, advancing our understanding of how economic interventions can affect mental health of youth in resource-poor settings. The findings underline that unconditional cash grants, which are used on an increasingly large scale as part of national social protection systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, have the potential to improve youth mental wellbeing and thus may help break the vicious cycle of poverty and poor mental health.

1258,"Inequalities in the nuclear age: impact of race and gender on radiation exposure at the Savannah River Site (1951-1999) Changes in the workforce during the civil rights movement may have impacted occupational exposures in the United States. We examined Savannah River Site (SRS) employee records (1951-1999) for changes in radiation doses and monitoring practices, by race and sex. Segregation of jobs by race and sex diminished but remained pronounced in recent years. Female workers were less likely than males to be monitored for occupational radiation exposure [odds of being unmonitored = 3.11; 95% CI: (2.79, 3.47)] even after controlling for job and decade of employment. Black workers were more likely than non-black workers to have a detectable radiation dose [OR = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.28, 1.43)]. Female workers have incomplete dose histories that would hinder compensation for illnesses related to occupational exposures. The persistence of job segregation and excess radiation exposures of black workers shows the need for further action to address disparities in occupational opportunities and hazardous exposures in the U. S. South.",,,5,,,
1259,"Management of cardiovascular risk in the usual care of medicaid recipients Uncontrolled risk factors contribute substantially to cardiovascular disease burden. With retrospective chart review, we examined rates of cardiovascular risk factor assessment and intervention during the course of usual care for a representative sample of 3,742 adult North Carolina Medicaid recipients with diagnosed hypertension managed by a primary care provider. Most patients had been established with their provider for at least three years. Ninety-six percent had multiple modifiable risk factors. Blood pressure and cholesterol were above goal for 52.9% and 37.2% of patients, respectively. Among those with uncontrolled blood pressure, only 44.3% had intensification of therapy within the prior year. Half of patients with cholesterol above goal were treated with medication; and half of current smokers had documented advice to quit. Documentation of aspirin use or counseling was rare. Despite Medicaid coverage and access to care, many effective strategies to prevent cardiovascular events were underutilized, even among patients at highest risk. _ Meharry Medical College.",,,3,,,
1260,"Further evidence for bats as the evolutionary source of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown. Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat. Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.IMPORTANCE Global surveillance efforts for undiscovered viruses are an important component of pandemic prevention initiatives. These surveys can be useful for finding novel viruses and for gaining insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors driving viral diversity; however, finding a viral sequence is not sufficient to determine whether it can infect people (i.e., poses a zoonotic threat). Here, we investigated the specific zoonotic risk of a MERS-like coronavirus (PREDICT/PDF-2180) identified in a bat from Uganda and showed that, despite being closely related to MERS-CoV, it is unlikely to pose a threat to humans. We suggest that this approach constitutes an appropriate strategy for beginning to determine the zoonotic potential of wildlife viruses. By showing that PREDICT/PDF-2180 does not infect cells that express the functional receptor for MERS-CoV, we further show that recombination was likely to be the critical step that allowed MERS to emerge in humans.

1262,"Potential effect of physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) labeling on adult fast food ordering and exercise INTRODUCTION: Numeric calorie content labels show limited efficacy in reducing the number of calories ordered from fast food meals. Physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) labels are an alternative that may reduce the number of calories ordered in fast food meals while encouraging patrons to exercise. METHODS: A total of 1000 adults from 47 US states were randomly assigned via internet survey to one of four generic fast food menus: no label, calories only, calories + minutes, or calories + miles necessary to walk to burn off the calories. After completing hypothetical orders participants were asked to rate the likelihood of calorie-only and PACE labels to influence (1) food choice and (2) physical activity. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 823) ordered a median of 1580 calories from the no-label menu, 1200 from the calories-only menu, 1140 from the calories + minutes menu, and 1210 from the calories + miles menu (p = 0.0001). 40% of respondents reported that PACE labels were ""very likely"" to influence food item choice vs. 28% for calorie-only labels (p< 0.0001). 64% of participants reported that PACE labels were ""somewhat likely"" or ""very likely"" to influence their level of physical activity vs. 49% for calorie-only labels (p< 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: PACE labels may be helpful in reducing the number of calories ordered in fast food meals and may have the added benefit of encouraging exercise.",,,9,,,
1263,"A cross-sectional survey of Plasmodium falciparum pfcrt mutant haplotypes in the Democratic Republic of Congo In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), artesunate-amodiaquine is first-line therapy for falciparum malaria; little is known about the prevalence of molecular markers of parasite drug resistance. Across the DRC, we genotyped 166 parasites in Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Of these parasites, 73 (44%) parasites were pure wild-type CVMNK, 55 (31%) parasites were chloroquine-resistant CVIET: , 35 (21.1%) parasites were mixed CVMNK and CVIET: , and 3 parasites were other genotypes. Ninety-two infections (55.4%) harbored the pfcrt K76T: substitution that is highly correlated with chloroquine failure. The amodiaquine-resistant S: VMNT: haplotype was absent. Geographically, pfcrt haplotypes were not clearly clustered. Chloroquine accounted for 19.4% of antimalarial use, and amodiaquine accounted for 15.3% of antimalarial use; there were no associations between drug use and mutant haplotype prevalence. In the DRC, our molecular survey indicates that resistance to chloroquine is substantial but that resistance to amodiaquine is absent. These contrasting findings highlight the need for molecular surveillance of drug resistance to inform malaria control policies. _ The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",,,1,,,
1264,"Tissue factor deficiency increases alveolar hemorrhage and death in influenza A virus-infected mice UNLABELLED: Essentials H1N1 Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a hemostatic challenge for the lung. Tissue factor (TF) on lung epithelial cells maintains lung hemostasis after IAV infection. Reduced TF-dependent activation of coagulation leads to alveolar hemorrhage. Anticoagulation might increase the risk for hemorrhages into the lung during severe IAV infection. SUMMARY: Background Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a common respiratory tract infection that causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Objective To investigate the effect of genetic deficiency of tissue factor (TF) in a mouse model of IAV infection. Methods Wild-type mice, low-TF (LTF) mice and mice with the TF gene deleted in different cell types were infected with a mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 strain of IAV. TF expression was measured in the lungs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to measure extracellular vesicle TF, activation of coagulation, alveolar hemorrhage, and inflammation. Results IAV infection of wild-type mice increased lung TF expression, activation of coagulation and inflammation in BALF, but also led to alveolar hemorrhage. LTF mice and mice with selective deficiency of TF in lung epithelial cells had low basal levels of TF and failed to increase TF expression after infection; these two strains of mice had more alveolar hemorrhage and death than controls. In contrast, deletion of TF in either myeloid cells or endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells did not increase alveolar hemorrhage or death after IAV infection. These results indicate that TF expression in the lung, particularly in epithelial cells, is required to maintain alveolar hemostasis after IAV infection. Conclusion Our study indicates that TF-dependent activation of coagulation is required to limit alveolar hemorrhage and death after IAV infection. _ 2016 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.",,,5,,,
1265,"Carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid levels in relation to prostate cancer aggressiveness among African-American and European-American men in the North Carolina-Louisiana prostate cancer project (PCaP) BACKGROUND: Associations between carotenoid intake and prostate cancer (CaP) incidence have varied across studies. This may result from combining indolent with aggressive disease in most studies. This study examined whether carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid levels were inversely associated with CaP aggressiveness. METHODS: Data on African-American (AA, n_=_1,023) and European-American (EA, n_=_1,079) men with incident CaP from North Carolina and Louisiana were analyzed. Dietary carotenoid intake was assessed using a detailed-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and abdominal adipose tissue samples were analyzed for carotenoid concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography. Multivariable logistic regression was used in race-stratified analyses to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) comparing high aggressive CaP with low/intermediate aggressive CaP. RESULTS: Carotenoid intake differed significantly between AAs and EAs, which included higher intake of lycopene among EAs and higher _-cryptoxanthin intake among AAs. Comparing the highest and lowest tertiles, dietary lycopene was associated inversely with high aggressive CaP among EAs (OR_=_0.55, 95%CI: 0.34-0.89, Ptrend _=_0.02), while an inverse association was observed between dietary _-cryptoxanthin intake and high aggressive CaP among AAs (OR_=_0.56, 95%CI: 0.36-0.87, Ptrend _=_0.01). Adipose tissue _-carotene and lycopene (cis_+__rans) concentrations were higher among EAs than AAs, and marginally significant inverse linear trends were observed for adipose _-carotene (Ptrend _=_0.07) and lycopene (Ptrend _=_0.11), and CaP aggressiveness among EAs only. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that diets high in lycopene and _-cryptoxanthin may protect against aggressive CaP among EAs and AAs, respectively. Differences in dietary behaviors may explain the observed racial differences in associations. Prostate 76:1053-1066, 2016. _ 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. _ 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,4,,,
1266,"Dietary, supplement, and adipose tissue tocopherol levels in relation to prostate cancer aggressiveness among African and European Americans: The North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) BACKGROUND: Controversies remain over the safety and efficacy of vitamin E (i.e., _-tocopherol) supplementation use for the prevention of prostate cancer (CaP); however, associations of different tocopherol forms and CaP aggressiveness have yet to be examined. METHODS: This study examined whether food intake of tocopherols, vitamin E supplement use, and adipose tissue biomarkers of tocopherol were associated with CaP aggressiveness among African-American (AA, n_=_1,023) and European-American (EA, n_=_1,079) men diagnosed with incident CaP. Dietary tocopherols were estimated from a food frequency questionnaire, supplement use from questionnaire/inventory, and biomarkers from abdominal adipose samples measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were estimated from logistic regression comparing high-aggressive CaP to low/intermediate aggressive CaP, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Dietary intakes of _-and _-tocopherol were related inversely to CaP aggressiveness among EAs [OR (95%CI), highest versus lowest quartile: _-tocopherol, 0.34 (0.17-0.69), P(trend) _=_0.006; _-tocopherol, 0.45 (0.21-0.95) P(trend) _=_0.007]. Inverse associations between dietary and supplemental _-tocopherol and CaP aggressiveness were observed among AAs, though these did not reach statistical significance [OR (95%CI), highest versus lowest quartile: dietary _-tocopherol, 0.58 (0.28-1.19), P(trend)_ =_0.20; supplemental _-tocopherol, 0.64 (0.31-1.21) P(trend) _=_0.15]. No significant association was observed between adipose tocopherol levels and CaP aggressiveness [OR (95%CI), highest versus lowest quartiles of _-tocopherol for EAs 1.43 (0.66-3.11) and AAs 0.66 (0.27-1.62)]. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse associations observed between dietary sources of tocopherols and CaP aggressiveness suggests a beneficial role of food sources of these tocopherols in CaP aggressiveness. _ 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,
1267,"National survey of practices to prevent health care-associated infections in Thailand: The role of prevention bundles BACKGROUND: We evaluated the practices used in Thai hospitals to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: From January 1, 2014-November 30, 2014, we surveyed all Thai hospitals with an intensive care unit and at least 250 beds. The use of prevention practices for CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP was assessed. High compliance (_75%) with all components of the CLABSI and VAP prevention bundles were determined. CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP infection rates before and after implementing infection control practices are reported. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between infection prevention bundle compliance and infection rate changes. RESULTS: Out of 245 eligible hospitals, 212 (86.5%) responded. A total of 120 (56.6%) and 115 hospitals (54.2%) reported _75% compliance for all components of the CLABSI and VAP prevention bundles, respectively, and 91 hospitals (42.9%) reported using _ 4 recommended CAUTI-prevention practices. High compliance with all of the CLABSI and VAP bundle components was associated with significant infection rate reductions (CLABSI, 38.3%; P_< _.001; VAP, 32.0%; P_< _.001). Hospitals regularly using _ 4 CAUTI-prevention practices did not have greater reductions in CAUTI (0.02%; P_=_.99).

Methods: From 1 January 2014 to 30 November 2014, we surveyed all Thai hospitals with an intensive care unit and _250 beds. Infection control practices for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) were assessed. Linear regression was used to examine associations between hospital characteristics and prevention bundle compliance and changes in MDRO infection rates. Results: A total of 212 of 245 (86.5%) eligible hospitals responded. Most hospitals regularly used several fundamental infection control practices for MRSA and MDR-AB (ie, contact precautions, private room/cohorting, hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, and antibiotic stewardship); advanced infection control practices (ie, active surveillance, chlorhexidine bathing, decolonization for MRSA, and hydrogen peroxide vaporizer for MDR-AB) were used less commonly. Facilities with _75% compliance with the MRSA prevention bundle experienced a 17.4% reduction in MRSA rates (P = .03). Although the presence of environmental cleaning services (41.3% reduction, P = .01) and a microbiology laboratory (82.8% reduction, P = .02) were among characteristics associated with decreases in MDR-AB rates, greater compliance with the MDR-AB prevention bundle did not lead to reductions in MDR-AB rates. Conclusions: Although fundamental MRSA and MDR-AB control practices are used regularly in most Thai hospitals, compliance with more comprehensive bundled prevention approaches is suboptimal. Improving compliance with bundled infection prevention approaches and promoting the integration of certain hospital factors into infection control efforts may help reduce MDRO infections in Thai hospitals. _ The Author 2017.

1270,"Embracing causal complexity in health disparities: metabolic syndemics and structural prevention in rural minority communities Chronic discrimination and associated socioeconomic inequalities have shaped the health and well-being of Black Americans. As a consequence of the intersection of these factors with rural deprivation, rural Black Americans live and work in particularly pathogenic environments that generate disproportionate and interacting chronic comorbidities (syndemics) compared to their White and/or urban counterparts. Traditional prevention research has been unable to fully capture the underlying complexity of rural minority health and has generated mostly low-leverage interventions that have failed to reverse adverse metabolic outcomes among rural Black Americans. In contrast, novel research approaches-such as system dynamics modeling-that seek to understand holistic system structure and determine complex health outcomes over time provide a robust framework to develop a more accurate understanding of the key factors contributing to type 2 diabetes. This framework can then be used to establish more efficacious interventions to address disparities among minorities in rural areas. This paper advocates for a unified complex systems epistemology and methodology in advancing rural minority health disparities research. Toward this goal, we (1) provide an overview of rural Black American metabolic health research, (2) introduce a complex systems framework in rural minority health disparities research, and (3) demonstrate how community-based system dynamics modeling and simulation can help us plow new ground in rural minority health disparities research and action. We anticipate that this paper can serve as a catalyst for a long-overdue discourse on the relevance of complex systems approaches in minority health research, with practical benefits for numerous disproportionately burdened communities.",,,2,,,
1271,"Adherence to World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research lifestyle recommendations reduces prostate cancer aggressiveness among African and Caucasian Americans The effect of adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) lifestyle recommendations on cancer aggressiveness is unknown. We examined associations between adherence to recommendations and risk of highly aggressive prostate cancer in research subjects enrolled in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). We examined associations between adherence to WCRF recommendations and risk of highly aggressive prostate cancer among 2212 newly diagnosed African Americans (AA) or Caucasian Americans (CA) aged 40-70 years in PCaP. Prostate cancer aggressiveness was based on Gleason scores, serum prostate-specific antigens, and TNM stage. Adherence to WCRF recommendations was based on point scores and odds ratios estimated. Results showed that adherence to recommendations was significantly and negatively associated with risk of a highly aggressive prostate cancer. Each additional point in the total adherence score corresponded to a 13% risk reduction. Total adherence score < 4 predicted increased risk in both AA (OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.01-1.85) and CA (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.01-1.98).

Classification of CaP aggressiveness at diagnosis was based on clinical criteria for 1,049 African-American (AA) and 1,083 Caucasian-American (CA) research subjects. Coffee consumption was measured using a modified NCI Dietary History Questionnaire. No significant associations were found between CaP aggressiveness and consumption of either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee. The OR for high aggressive CaP among consumers of more than 4 cups per day was 0.92 (95%CI = 0.61, 1.39), compared to non-coffee-drinkers. Results stratified by race found no significant associations and no noticeable trends in either AAs (P for trend = 0. 62) or CAs (P for trend = 0.42). In contrast to a recent report on a select population that has less complete information on CaP aggressiveness suggesting that coffee prevents aggressive CaP, this rapid case ascertainment population-based study, in a biracial population with differing risks of CaP did not demonstrate a protective relationship between high coffee consumption and risk of high aggressive CaP.",,,3,,,
1273,"Diversity of T cell epitopes in Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein likely due to protein-protein interactions Circumsporozoite protein (CS) is a leading vaccine antigen for falciparum malaria, but is highly polymorphic in natural parasite populations. The factors driving this diversity are unclear, but non-random assortment of the T cell epitopes TH2 and TH3 has been observed in a Kenyan parasite population. The recent publication of the crystal structure of the variable C terminal region of the protein allows the assessment of the impact of diversity on protein structure and T cell epitope assortment. Using data from the Gambia (55 isolates) and Malawi (235 isolates), we evaluated the patterns of diversity within and between epitopes in these two distantly-separated populations. Only non-synonymous mutations were observed with the vast majority in both populations at similar frequencies suggesting strong selection on this region. A non-random pattern of T cell epitope assortment was seen in Malawi and in the Gambia, but structural analysis indicates no intramolecular spatial interactions. Using the information from these parasite populations, structural analysis reveals that polymorphic amino acids within TH2 and TH3 colocalize to one side of the protein, surround, but do not involve, the hydrophobic pocket in CS, and predominately involve charge switches. In addition, free energy analysis suggests residues forming and behind the novel pocket within CS are tightly constrained and well conserved in all alleles. In addition, free energy analysis shows polymorphic residues tend to be populated by energetically unfavorable amino acids. In combination, these findings suggest the diversity of T cell epitopes in CS may be primarily an evolutionary response to intermolecular interactions at the surface of the protein potentially counteracting antibody-mediated immune recognition or evolving host receptor diversity.",,,1,,,
1274,"Type-specific herpes simplex virus-1 and herpes simplex virus-2 seroprevalence in Romania: comparison of prevalence and risk factors in women and men OBJECTIVE: To determine herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 and HSV-1 seroprevalence in women and men in Romania. METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted between 2004 and 2005 on a total of 1058 women and men representative of the population of Bucharest. All participants were aged 15-44 years and completed a structured questionnaire. A blood sample was collected to detect IgG anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 serum antibodies using the HerpeSelect ELISA (Focus Diagnostics). RESULTS: A total of 761 women (median age 29 years) and 297 men (median age 29 years) were included. Overall, HSV-2 seroprevalence (15.2%) increased with age. Among women, HSV-2 seroprevalence increased from 11.0% in 15-19-year-olds to 38.3% in 40-44-year-olds. Among men, seroprevalence increased from 4.0% in 20-24-year-olds to 27.1% in 40-44-year-olds. HSV-2 seroprevalence was significantly higher among women than men (17.0% vs. 10.8%). HSV-1 seropositivity was high (87.2%) in all age groups, with no clear trend by age or by sex. In addition to older age and female sex, risk factors for HSV-2 included greater number of lifetime sexual partners, lower educational attainment, and history of genital vesicles. Lower educational level and rural residence were associated with a higher risk of HSV-1 seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS: In Romania, HSV-2 seroprevalence was higher in women than men, and was within European limits and lower than that in Africa and the USA. In contrast, HSV-1 seroprevalence was generally higher than that previously recorded in similarly aged populations in Western Europe. Copyright _ 2010 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

1276,"Associations between acculturation, ethnic identity, and diet quality among U.S. Hispanic/Latino Youth: Findings from the HCHS/SOL Youth Study BACKGROUND: Acculturation among Hispanic/Latinos has been linked to deteriorating dietary quality that may contribute to obesity risks. This study examined the relationship between acculturation, ethnic identity, and dietary quality in U.S. Hispanic/Latino youth. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1298 Hispanic/Latino youth ages 8-16 from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latino Youth (HCHS/SOL Youth), an ancillary study of offspring of participants in the adult HCHS/SOL cohort. Multivariable regression analyses assessed relationships between acculturation and ethnic identity with dietary quality as measured by Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores, accounting for covariates, design effects, and sample weights. We also compared HEI scores by immigrant generation and language of interview. RESULTS: Youth were 12__2.5 -years and 49.3% female. They were placed into five acculturation categories-including 48% integrated (bicultural orientation), 32.7% assimilated (high U.S. and low Latino orientation), 5.9% separated (high Latino and low U.S. orientation) or marginalized (neither U.S. nor Latino orientation), and 13.3% unclassified. Mean HEI was 53.8; there were no differences in HEI scores by acculturation category, but integrated youth had higher whole grains scores, lower sodium scores, and lower empty calories scores compared to assimilated youth. There were no differences in HEI scores by ethnic identity scores, and no consistent trend between dietary quality and ethnic identity. First- and second-generation youth had higher HEI scores, compared to third-generation youth, and, Spanish-speaking youth had higher HEI scores compared to English-speaking youth. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that integrated youth in the U.S. may engage in healthier eating behaviors than those who are assimilated. Additional research on Hispanic/Latino youths' acculturation and diet can inform health promotion efforts to improve eating habits and health outcomes among this population.

1277,"Development of a workplace intervention for child care staff: caring and reaching for health's (CARE) healthy lifestyles intervention Child care staff are among the lowest wage workers, a group at increased risk for a wide array of chronic diseases. To date, the health of child care staff has been largely ignored, and there have been very few interventions designed for child care staff. This article describes the development of the Caring and Reaching for Health (CARE) Healthy Lifestyles intervention, a workplace intervention aimed at improving physical activity and health behaviors among child care staff. Theory and evidence-based behavior change techniques informed the development of intervention components with targets at multiple social ecological levels. Final intervention components included an educational workshop held at a kick-off event, followed by three 8-week campaigns. Intervention components within each campaign included (1) an informational magazine, (2) goal setting and weekly behavior self-monitoring, (3) weekly tailored feedback, (4) e-mail/text prompts, (5) center-level displays that encouraged team-based goals and activities, and (6) coaching for center directors. This multilevel, theory-driven intervention is currently being evaluated as part of a larger randomized controlled trial. Process evaluation efforts will assess the extent to which child care staff participated in, engaged with, and were satisfied with the intervention. Lessons learned will guide future intervention research engaging child care workers.",,,9,,,
1278,"Effect of secondary organic aerosol from isoprene-derived hydroxyhydroperoxides on the expression of oxidative stress response genes in human bronchial epithelial cells Isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which comprise a large portion of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5), can be formed through various gaseous precursors, including isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX), methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE), and isoprene hydroxyhydroperoxides (ISOPOOH). The composition of the isoprene-derived SOA affects its reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation potential and its ability to alter oxidative stress-related gene expression. In this study we assess effects of isoprene SOA derived solely from ISOPOOH oxidation on human bronchial epithelial cells by measuring the gene expression changes in 84 oxidative stress-related genes. In addition, the thiol reactivity of ISOPOOH-derived SOA was measured through the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Our findings show that ISOPOOH-derived SOA alter more oxidative-stress related genes than IEPOX-derived SOA but not as many as MAE-derived SOA on a mass basis exposure. More importantly, we found that the different types of SOA derived from the various gaseous precursors (MAE, IEPOX, and ISOPOOH) have unique contributions to changes in oxidative stress-related genes that do not total all gene expression changes seen in exposures to atmospherically relevant compositions of total isoprene-derived SOA mixtures. This study suggests that amongst the different types of known isoprene-derived SOA, MAE-derived SOA are the most potent inducer of oxidative stress-related gene changes but highlights the importance of considering isoprene-derived SOA as a total mixture for pollution controls and exposure studies.",,,1,,,

We estimated the proportion of American adults with optimal cardiometabolic health, using different guidelines. METHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2016 were analyzed (n_=_8721). Using the most recent guidelines, metabolic health was defined as having optimal levels of waist circumference (WC < 102/88__m for men/women), glucose (fasting glucose < 100__g/dL and hemoglobin A1c < 5.7%), blood pressure (systolic < 120 and diastolic < 80__mHg), triglycerides (< 150__g/dL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (_40/50__g/dL for men/women), and not taking any related medication. RESULTS: Changing from ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel III) guidelines to more recent cut points decreased the proportion of metabolically healthy Americans from 19.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.3-21.5) to 12.2% (95% CI: 10.9-13.6). Dropping WC from the definition increased the percentage of adults with optimal metabolic health to 17.6%. Characteristics associated with greater prevalence of metabolic health were female gender, youth, more education, never smoking, practicing vigorous physical activity, and low body mass index. Less than one-third of normal weight adults were metabolically healthy and the prevalence decreased to 8.0% and 0.5% in overweight and obese individuals, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of metabolic health in American adults is alarmingly low, even in normal weight individuals. The large number of people not achieving optimal levels of risk factors, even in low-risk groups, has serious implications for public health.",,,9,,,
1280,"Differences in microbial signatures between rectal mucosal biopsies and rectal swabs There is growing evidence the microbiota of the large bowel may influence the risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as other diseases including type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome. Current sampling methods to obtain microbial specimens, such as feces and mucosal biopsies, are inconvenient and unappealing to patients. Obtaining samples through rectal swabs could prove to be a quicker and relatively easier method, but it is unclear if swabs are an adequate substitute. We compared bacterial diversity and composition from rectal swabs and rectal mucosal biopsies in order to examine the viability of rectal swabs as an alternative to biopsies. Paired rectal swabs and mucosal biopsy samples were collected in un-prepped participants (n = 11) and microbial diversity was characterized by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial community composition from swab samples was different from rectal mucosal biopsies (p = 0.001). Overall the bacterial diversity was higher in swab samples than in biopsies as assessed by diversity indexes such as: richness (p = 0.01), evenness (p = 0.06) and Shannon's diversity (p = 0.04). Analysis of specific bacterial groups by qPCR showed higher copy number of Lactobacillus (p < 0.0001) and Eubacteria (p = 0.0003) in swab samples compared with biopsies. Our findings suggest that rectal swabs and rectal mucosal samples provide different views of the microbiota in the large intestine.",,,1,,,

1282,"Genome-wide meta-analysis identified novel variant associated with hallux valgus in Caucasians BACKGROUND: Hallux valgus, one of the most common structural foot deformities, is highly heritable. However, previous efforts to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of hallux valgus through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in 4409 Caucasians did not identify genome-wide significant associations with hallux valgus in both gender-specific and sex-combined GWAS meta-analyses. In this analysis, we add newly available data and more densely imputed genotypes to identify novel genetic variants associated with hallux valgus. METHODS: A total of 5925 individuals of European Ancestry were categorized into two groups: 'hallux valgus present' (n_=_2314) or 'no deformity' (n_=_3611) as determined by trained examiners or using the Manchester grading scale. Genotyping was performed using commercially available arrays followed by imputation to the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) reference panel version 1.1. We conducted both sex-specific and sex-combined association analyses using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations as appropriate in each cohort. Results were then combined in a fixed-effects inverse-variance meta-analyses. Functional Mapping and Annotation web-based platform (FUMA) was used for positional mapping, gene and gene-set analyses. RESULTS: We identified a novel locus in the intronic region of CLCA2 on chromosome 1, rs55807512 (OR_=_0.48, p_=_2.96E-09), an expression quantitative trait locus for COL24A1, a member of the collagen gene family. CONCLUSION: In this report of the largest GWAS of hallux valgus to date, we identified a novel genome-wide significant locus for hallux valgus. Additional replication and functional follow-up will be needed to determine the functional role of this locus in hallux valgus biology.",,,8,,,
1283,"Impaired adipogenic response to thiazolidinediones in mice expressing human apolipoproteinE4 Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are insulin sensitizers used to treat patients with insulin resistance. To assess potential gene-drug interactions, mice expressing human apolipoprotein E3 or E4 (APOE3 or APOE4) were fed a Western-type high-fat diet for 12 wk, at which time they developed similarly impaired glucose tolerance. Supplementing the diet with rosiglitazone (1.5 mg/g body weight) for an additional 4 wk improved plasma lipid profiles in both APOE3 and APOE4 mice. However, glucose tolerance improved only in APOE3 mice. Induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis was severely blunted in adipose tissues, but not in the livers, of APOE4 mice. Consequently, lipids were channeled to the liver, causing marked steatosis in these mice. Impaired glucose tolerance was not a prerequisite for this adverse effect, and long-term treatment with rosiglitazone altered liver enzymes and caused hepatic fibrosis in APOE4 mice. Finally, TZDs failed to stimulate PPAR_ activation and adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes and embryonic fibroblasts isolated from APOE4 mice compared to those from APOE3 mice. We conclude that the effects of TZDs are APOE isoform dependent, and that the metabolic damage observed in APOE4 mice is rooted in an impaired activation of the adipogenic program in the adipose tissues expressing APOE4.",,,5,,,
1284,"Metabolic shifts toward fatty-acid usage and increased thermogenesis are associated with impaired adipogenesis in mice expressing human APOE4 BACKGROUND: The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene encodes for three isoforms in the human population (APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4). Whereas the role of APOE in lipid metabolism is well characterized, the specific metabolic signatures of the APOE isoforms during metabolic disorders, remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the molecular underpinnings of APOE-directed metabolic alterations, we tested the hypothesis that APOE4 drives a whole-body metabolic shift toward increased lipid oxidation. METHODS: We employed humanized mice in which the Apoe gene has been replaced by the human APOE*3 or APOE*4 allele to produce human APOE3 or APOE4 proteins and characterized several mechanisms of fatty-acid oxidation, lipid storage, substrate utilization and thermogenesis in those mice. RESULTS: We show that, whereas APOE4 mice gained less body weight and mass than their APOE3 counterparts on a Western-type diet (P< 0.001), they displayed elevated insulin and homeostatic model assessment, markers of insulin resistance (P=0.004 and P=0.025, respectively). APOE4 mice also demonstrated a reduced respiratory quotient during the postprandial period (0.95_0.03 versus 1.06_0.03, P< 0.001), indicating increased usage of lipids as opposed to carbohydrates as a fuel source. Finally, APOE4 mice showed increased body temperature (37.30_0.68 versus 36.9_0.58___, P=0.039), augmented cold tolerance and more metabolically active brown adipose tissue compared with APOE3 mice. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that APOE4 mice may resist weight gain via an APOE4-directed global metabolic shift toward lipid oxidation and enhanced thermogenesis, and may represent a critical first step in the development of APOE-directed therapies for a large percentage of the population affected by disorders with established links to APOE and metabolism.",,,1,,,
1285,"Kidney function and cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women: the impact of race and ethnicity in the women's health initiative BACKGROUND: Kidney disease disproportionately affects minority populations, including African Americans and Hispanics; therefore, understanding the relationship of kidney function to cardiovascular (CV) outcomes within different racial/ethnic groups is of considerable interest. We investigated the relationship between kidney function and CV events and assessed effect modification by race/ethnicity in the Women's Health Initiative. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Baseline serum creatinine concentrations (assay traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry standard) of 19,411 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who self-identified as either non-Hispanic white (n=8,921), African American (n=7,436), or Hispanic (n=3,054) were used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs). PREDICTORS: Categories of eGFR (exposure); race/ethnicity (effect modifier). OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the composite of 3 physician-adjudicated CV events: myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV-related death. MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated the multivariable-adjusted associations between categories of eGFR and CV events using proportional hazards regression and formally tested for effect modification by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 7.6 years, 1,424 CV events (653 myocardial infarctions, 627 strokes, and 297 CV-related deaths) were observed. The association between eGFR and CV events was curvilinear; however, the association of eGFR with CV outcomes differed by race (P=0.006). In stratified analyses, we_observed that the U-shaped association was present in non-Hispanic whites, whereas African American participants had a rather curvilinear relationship, with lower eGFR being associated with higher CV risk, and higher eGFR, with reduced CV risk. Analyses among Hispanic women were inconclusive owing to few Hispanic women having very low or high eGFRs and very few events occurring in these categories. LIMITATIONS: Lack of urinary albumin measurements; residual confounding by unmeasured or imprecisely measured characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, the patterns of association between eGFR and CV risk differed between non-Hispanic whites and African American women.

1286,"Cumulative Burden of Colorectal Cancer-Associated Genetic Variants Is More Strongly Associated With Early-Onset vs Late-Onset Cancer BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC, in persons younger than 50 years old) is increasing in incidence; yet, in the absence of a family history of CRC, this population lacks harmonized recommendations for prevention. We aimed to determine whether a polygenic risk score (PRS) developed from 95 CRC-associated common genetic risk variants was associated with risk for early-onset CRC. METHODS: We studied risk for CRC associated with a weighted PRS in 12,197 participants younger than 50 years old vs 95,865 participants 50 years or older. PRS was calculated based on single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CRC in a large-scale genome-wide association study as of January 2019. Participants were pooled from 3 large consortia that provided clinical and genotyping data: the Colon Cancer Family Registry, the Colorectal Transdisciplinary Study, and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and were all of genetically defined European descent. Findings were replicated in an independent cohort of 72,573 participants. RESULTS: Overall associations with CRC per standard deviation of PRS were significant for early-onset cancer, and were stronger compared with late-onset cancer (P for interaction_= .01); when we compared the highest PRS quartile with the lowest, risk increased 3.7-fold for early-onset CRC (95% CI 3.28-4.24) vs 2.9-fold for late-onset CRC (95% CI 2.80-3.04). This association was strongest for participants without a first-degree family history of CRC (P for interaction_= 5.61__ 10-5). When we compared the highest with the lowest quartiles in this group, risk increased 4.3-fold for early-onset CRC (95% CI 3.61-5.01) vs 2.9-fold for late-onset CRC (95% CI 2.70-3.00). Sensitivity analyses were consistent with these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of associations with CRC per standard deviation of PRS, we found the cumulative burden of CRC-associated common genetic variants to associate with early-onset cancer, and to be more strongly associated with early-onset than late-onset cancer, particularly in the absence of CRC family history. Analyses of PRS, along with environmental and lifestyle risk factors, might identify younger individuals who would benefit from preventive measures. Copyright _ 2020 AGA Institute.

1287,"Antiretroviral intensification and valproic acid lack sustained effect on residual HIV-1 viremia or resting CD4+ cell infection BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a daunting problem. Given the limited evidence that resting CD4+ T cell infection (RCI) is affected by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA), we measured the stability of RCI and residual viremia in patients who added VPA with or without raltegravir (RAL), or enfuvirtide (ENF) with or without VPA, to standard ART. METHODS: Patients with plasma HIV RNA< 50 c/mL added sustained-release VPA (Depakote ER) twice daily, RAL 400 mg twice daily, or ENF 90 mcg twice daily. Change in RCI was measured by outgrowth assays. Low-level viremia was quantitated by single-copy plasma HIV RNA assay (SCA). RESULTS: In three patients on standard ART a depletion of RCI was observed after 16 weeks of VPA, but this effect waned over up to 96 weeks of further VPA. In two patients ENF added to stable ART had no effect on RCI. Simultaneous intensification with ENF and addition of VPA had no effect on RCI frequency in one patient, and resulted in a 46% decline in a second. No significant depletion of RCI (>50%) was seen in six volunteers after the addition of RAL and VPA. In 4 of the 6 patients this lack of effect might be attributed to intermittent viremia, low VPA levels, or intermittent study therapy adherence. Overall, there was no effect of the addition of RAL or ENF on low-level viremia measured by SCA. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective addition of VPA and RAL, VPA and ENF, or ENF failed to progressively reduce the frequency of RCI, or ablate intermittent and low-level viremia. New approaches such as more potent HDAC inhibition, alone or in combination with intensified ART or other agents that may disrupt proviral latency must be pursued.",,,5,,,
1288,"Circulating ceruloplasmin, ceruloplasmin-associated genes, and the incidence of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study BACKGROUND: Ceruloplasmin (CP) may promote structural changes in the atrium making it more arrhythmogenic. We assessed the associations between CP, CP-associated genetic variants, and incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 10,059 men and women without prevalent AF aged 53 to 75years in 1996-1998 and followed through 2012. Circulating CP was measured in stored blood samples obtained in 1996-1998. Polymorphisms rs11708215 and rs13072552, previously associated with CP concentrations, were measured in 10,059 and 8829 participants respectively. AF was ascertained from study electrocardiograms, hospital discharge codes, and death certificates. Multivariable Cox models were run to study the association between circulating CP, CP-associated polymorphisms, and the incidence of AF. Over 10.5years of mean follow-up, 1357 cases of AF were identified. After adjusting for traditional risk factors and biomarkers, higher levels of circulating CP were associated with incident AF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11, 1.61 comparing top to bottom quartiles). Both rs11708215 and rs13072552 were significantly associated with CP levels. Presence of the CP-increasing alleles in rs11708215 and rs13072552, however, were significantly associated with lower risk of AF in whites (HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.76, 0.94, p=0.002 and HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.69, 0.99, p=0.043 respectively per CP-increasing allele in the final adjusted model) but not in African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Even though higher CP concentrations were associated with increased AF risk, genetic variants associated with higher CP decreased the risk of AF in whites. Our results suggest that circulating CP levels may not be causally related to risk of incident AF. Copyright _ 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,9,,,
1289,"Denitrification potential of the eastern oyster microbiome using a 16S rRNA gene based metabolic inference approach The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a foundation species providing significant ecosystem services. However, the roles of oyster microbiomes have not been integrated into any of the services, particularly nitrogen removal through denitrification. We investigated the composition and denitrification potential of oyster microbiomes with an approach that combined 16S rRNA gene analysis, metabolic inference, qPCR of the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ), and N2 flux measurements. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive gland, the oyster shell, and sediments adjacent to the oyster reef were examined based on next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Denitrification potentials of the microbiomes were determined by metabolic inferences using a customized denitrification gene and genome database with the paprica (PAthway PRediction by phylogenetIC plAcement) bioinformatics pipeline. Denitrification genes examined included nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), which was further subdivided by genotype into clade I (nosZI) or clade II (nosZII). Continuous flow through experiments measuring N2 fluxes were conducted with the oysters, shells, and sediments to compare denitrification activities. Paprica properly classified the composition of microbiomes, showing similar classification results from Silva, Greengenes and RDP databases. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive glands and shells were quite different from each other and from the sediments. The relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria inferred by paprica was higher in oysters and shells than in sediments suggesting that oysters act as hotspots for denitrification in the marine environment. Similarly, the inferred nosZI gene abundances were also higher in the oyster and shell microbiomes than in the sediment microbiome. Gene abundances for nosZI were verified with qPCR of nosZI genes, which showed a significant positive correlation (F1,7 = 14.7, p = 6.0x10-3, R2 = 0.68). N2 flux rates were significantly higher in the oyster (364.4 _ 23.5 _mol N-N2 m-2 h-1) and oyster shell (355.3 _ 6.4 _mol N-N2 m-2 h-1) compared to the sediment (270.5 _ 20.1 _mol N-N2 m-2 h-1). Thus, bacteria carrying nosZI genes were found to be an important denitrifier, facilitating nitrogen removal in oyster reefs. In addition, this is the first study to validate the use of 16S gene based metabolic inference as a method for determining microbiome function, such as denitrification, by comparing inference results with qPCR gene quantification and rate measurements.",,,1,,,
1290,"Gene-specific differential DNA methylation and chronic arsenic exposure in an epigenome-wide association study of adults in Bangladesh BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic is one of the most common naturally occurring contaminants found in the environment. Arsenic is associated with a number of health outcomes, with epigenetic modification suggested as a potential mechanism of toxicity. OBJECTIVE: Among a sample of 400 adult participants, we evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, as measured by blood and urinary total arsenic concentrations, and epigenome-wide white blood cell DNA methylation. METHODS: We used linear regression models to examine the associations between arsenic exposure and methylation at each CpG site, adjusted for sex, age, and batch. Differentially methylated loci were subsequently examined in relation to corresponding gene expression for functional evidence of gene regulation. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, we observed four differentially methylated CpG sites with urinary total arsenic concentration and three differentially methylated CpG sites with blood arsenic concentration, based on the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of p < 1 _ 10(-7). Methylation of PLA2G2C (probe cg04605617) was the most significantly associated locus in relation to both urinary (p = 3.40 _ 10(-11)) and blood arsenic concentrations (p = 1.48 _ 10(-11)). Three additional novel methylation loci-SQSTM1 (cg01225779), SLC4A4 (cg06121226), and IGH (cg13651690)--were also significantly associated with arsenic exposure. Further, there was evidence of methylation-related gene regulation based on gene expression for a subset of differentially methylated loci. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant associations between arsenic exposure and gene-specific differential white blood cell DNA methylation, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may be an important pathway underlying arsenic toxicity. The specific differentially methylated loci identified may inform potential pathways for future interventions.",,,8,,,
1291,"Baseline comorbidities in a skin cancer prevention trial in Bangladesh BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic research suggests that increased cancer risk due to chronic arsenic exposure persists for several decades even after the exposure has terminated. Observational studies suggest that antioxidants exert a protective effect on arsenical skin lesions and cancers among those chronically exposed to arsenic through drinking water. This study reports on the design, methods and baseline analyses from the Bangladesh Vitamin E and Selenium Trial (BEST), a population-based chemoprevention study conducted among adults in Bangladesh with visible arsenic toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bangladesh Vitamin E and Selenium Trial is a 2 _ 2 full factorial, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 7000 adults having manifest arsenical skin lesions evaluating the efficacy of 6-year supplementation with alpha-tocopherol (100 mg daily) and L-selenomethionine (200 _g daily) for the prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses, we observed significant associations of skin lesion severity with male gender (female prevalence odds ratio (POR) = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.79-0.96), older age (aged 36-45 years, POR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.13-1.42; aged 46-55 years, POR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.27-1.64 and aged 56-65 years, POR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.26-1.78 compared with aged 25-35 years), hypertension (POR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.08-1.55), diabetes (POR = 2.13; 95% CI = 1.32-3.46), asthma (POR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.03-2.32) and peptic ulcer disease (POR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.07-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: We report novel associations between arsenical skin lesions with several common chronic diseases. With the rapidly increasing burden of preventable cancers in developing countries, efficient and feasible chemoprevention study designs and approaches, such as employed in BEST, may prove both timely and potentially beneficial in conceiving cancer chemoprevention trials in Bangladesh and beyond. _ 2013 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

1292,"Characterization of metabolic syndrome among diverse Hispanics/Latinos living in the United States: Latent class analysis from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Empirical investigation of the adequacy of metabolic syndrome (MetS) diagnostic criteria, and whether meaningful subtypes of MetS exist, is needed among Hispanics/Latinos. METHODS: In 15,825 US Hispanics/Latinos from HCHS/SOL, latent class analysis of MetS components (waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and antihypertensive, lipid- and glucose-lowering medication use) was used to investigate (1) whether distinct subtypes of MetS could be identified, and how component levels differed between them, and (2) how identified subtypes related to covariates and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence. RESULTS: Two latent clusters emerged in both men (n=6317) and women (n=9508): one characterized by relatively healthy mean levels (Non-MetS cluster, 77.1% of men and 67.1% of women) and the other by clinically elevated mean levels (MetS cluster, 22.9% of men and 32.9% of women) across most MetS components. These clusters showed expected associations with covariates and CVD prevalence. Notable results suggest that (1) HDL cholesterol may poorly differentiate between US Hispanics/Latinos with and without MetS (mean=45.4 vs. 44.6 mg/dL for men and 51.3 vs. 52.0 mg/dL for women in the MetS vs. Non-MetS clusters, respectively) and (2) the NCEP-ATP III 88 cm waist circumference cutoff for US females may not optimize diagnosis among Hispanic/Latino women (MetS cluster mean waist circumference=102.5 cm). CONCLUSIONS: Beyond classification into having MetS or not, additional subtypes of MetS do not clearly emerge in US Hispanics/Latinos. Current diagnostic cutoffs for some components may not optimize MetS identification among this population. Copyright _ 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
1293,"Redefining racial residential segregation and its association with physical activity among African Americans 50 years and older: a mixed methods approach Physical inactivity is one of the factors contributing to disproportionate disease rates among older African Americans. Previous literature indicates that older African Americans are more likely to live in racially segregated neighborhoods and that racial residential segregation is associated with limited opportunities for physical activity. A cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted guided by the concept of therapeutic landscapes. Multilevel regression analyses demonstrated that racial residential segregation was associated with more minutes of physical activity and greater odds of meeting physical activity recommendations. Qualitative interviews revealed the following physical activity related themes: aging of the neighborhood, knowing your neighbors, feeling of safety, and neighborhood racial identity. Perceptions of social cohesion enhanced participants' physical activity, offering a plausible explanation to the higher rates of physical activity found in this population. Understanding how social cohesion operates within racially segregated neighborhoods can help to inform the design of effective interventions for this population.",,,9,,,
1294,"Linguistic validation of the Spanish version of the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) PURPOSE: The U.S. NCI's PRO-CTCAE is a library of self-report items for assessing symptomatic adverse events in cancer clinical trials from the patient perspective. The aim of this study was to translate and linguistically validate a Spanish version. METHODS: PRO-CTCAE's 124 items were translated from English into Spanish using multiple forward and back translations. Native Spanish speakers undergoing cancer treatment were enrolled at six cancer treatment sites. Participants each completed approximately 50 items and were then interviewed using cognitive probes. The interviews were analyzed at the item level by linguistic themes, and responses were examined for evidence of equivalence to English. Items for which _20_% of participants experienced difficulties were reviewed, and phrasing was revised and then retested in subsequent interviews. Items where < 20_% of respondents experienced difficulties were also reviewed and were considered for rephrasing and retesting. RESULTS: One hundred nine participants from diverse Spanish-speaking countries were enrolled (77 in Round 1 and 32 in Round 2). A majority of items were well comprehended in Round 1. Two items presented difficulties in _20_% of participants and were revised/retested without further difficulties. Two items presented difficulties in < 20_%, and when retested exhibited no further difficulties. Two items presented difficulties in < 20_%, but were not revised due to lack of alternatives. Sixteen items presented difficulties in _12_% and were not revised because difficulties were minor. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish PRO-CTCAE has been developed and refined for use in Spanish-speaking populations, with high levels of comprehension and equivalence to the English PRO-CTCAE.

1295,"Estimates of donated sperm use in the United States: National Survey of Family Growth 1995-2017 OBJECTIVE: To provide national estimates of donor insemination (DI) use in the United States and a description of the population of users. DESIGN: Population estimates were generated from nationally representative data through weighted proportions and count estimates. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Participants were U.S. women of childbearing age (15-44_years) sampled for interview in the National Survey of Family Growth. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Respondents who reported having received artificial insemination were asked the origin of the sperm. Responses could include husband/partner, donor only, or mixed donor and husband/partner. RESULT(S): In 1995, an estimated 170,701 (95% confidence interval 106,577-234,825) women had undergone DI using donor or mixed sperm. In 2015-2017, 440,986 (95% confidence interval 108,458-773,513) women were estimated to have used it. The DI users were mostly white, urban, older, college-educated, and had high family incomes. CONCLUSION(S): The DI use changed over time, from a decrease between 1995 and 2013 to a precipitous growth in 2015 to 2017. In recent years, nearly half a million women may be dealing with personal, relationship, and familial issues born of DI use. The United States does not maintain records on the usage of donor sperm, but better tracking of the use and outcomes of treatment would provide better estimates of the size of the affected population.

1296,"Fifteen-Year Trends in Management and Outcomes of Non-ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Among Black and White Patients: The ARIC Community Surveillance Study, 2000-2014 Background Standardization of evidence-based medical therapies has improved outcomes for patients with non- ST -segment-elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ). Although racial differences in NSTEMI management have previously been reported, it is uncertain whether these differences have been ameliorated over time. Methods and Results The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Community Surveillance study conducts hospital surveillance of acute myocardial infarction in 4 US communities. NSTEMI was classified by physician review, using a validated algorithm. From 2000 to 2014, 17_755 weighted hospitalizations for NSTEMI (patient race: 36% black, 64% white) were sampled by ARIC . Black patients were younger (aged 60 versus 66_years), more often female (45% versus 38%), and less likely to have medical insurance (88% versus 93%) but had more comorbidities. Black patients were less often administered aspirin (85% versus 92%), other antiplatelet therapy (45% versus 60%), _-blockers (85% versus 88%), and lipid-lowering medications (68% versus 76%). After adjustments, black patients had a 24% lower probability of receiving nonaspirin antiplatelets (relative risk: 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.81), a 29% lower probability of angiography (relative risk: 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.76), and a 45% lower probability of revascularization (relative risk: 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.60). No suggestion of a changing trend over time was observed for any NSTEMI therapy ( P values for interaction, all >0.20). Conclusions This longitudinal community surveillance of hospitalized NSTEMI patients suggests black patients have more comorbidities and less likelihood of receiving guideline-based NSTEMI therapies, and these findings persisted across the 15-year period. Focused efforts to reduce comorbidity burden and to more consistently implement guideline-directed treatments in this high-risk population are warranted.",,,5,,,
1297,"Twenty year trends and sex differences in young adults hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction BACKGROUND: Sex differences are known to exist in the management of older patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Few studies have examined the incidence and risk factors of AMI among young patients, or whether clinical management differs by sex. METHODS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Surveillance study conducts hospital surveillance of AMI in 4 US communities (MD, MN, MS, and NC). AMI was classified by physician review, using a validated algorithm. Medications and procedures were abstracted from the medical record. Our study population was limited to young patients aged 35 to 54 years. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2014, 28_732 weighted hospitalizations for AMI were sampled among patients aged 35 to 74 years. Of these, 8737 (30%) were young. The annual incidence of AMI hospitalizations increased for young women but decreased for young men. The overall proportion of AMI admissions attributable to young patients steadily increased, from 27% in 1995 to 1999 to 32% in 2010 to 2014 ( P for trend=0.002), with the largest increase observed in young women. History of hypertension (59% to 73%, P for trend< 0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (25% to 35%, P for trend< 0.0001) also increased among young AMI patients. Compared to young men, young women presenting with AMI were more often black and had a greater comorbidity burden. In adjusted analyses, young women had a lower probability of receiving lipid-lowering therapies (relative risk [RR]=0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.94), nonaspirin antiplatelets (RR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.91), beta blockers (RR=0.96; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99), coronary angiography (RR=0.93; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99) and coronary revascularization (RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.87). However, 1-year all-cause mortality was comparable for women versus men (HR=1.10; 95% CI, 0.83-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of AMI hospitalizations attributable to young patients increased from 1995 to 2014 and was especially pronounced among women. History of hypertension and diabetes among young patients admitted with AMI increased over time as well. Compared with young men, young women presenting with AMI had a lower likelihood of receiving guideline-based AMI therapies. A better understanding of factors underlying these changes is needed to improve care of young patients with AMI.",,,3,,,
1298,"Physical activity levels in U.S. latino/hispanic adults: results from the hispanic community health study/study of latinos INTRODUCTION: Physical activity (PA) prevalence among U.S. Latino/Hispanic adults of diverse backgrounds is not well known. This study describes PA among a representative sample of U.S. Latino/Hispanic adults. METHODS: A population-based cohort of Hispanic/Latino adults (aged 18-74 years) participating in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos from March 2008 to June 2011 (N=16,415) was recruited in four urban areas from Miami, the Bronx, Chicago, and San Diego. Participants wore an Actical hip accelerometer for 1 week (n=12,253) and completed the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (n=15,741). Data were analyzed in 2015. RESULTS: Based on accelerometry, Hispanics/Latinos engaged in 23.8 minutes/day (10.3 minutes/day when only considering minutes from sustained 10-minute bouts) of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Individuals of Puerto Rican and Dominican background had the most minutes/day of MVPA (32.1 and 29.1, respectively), whereas those of Cuban background had the fewest (15.3). Based on the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, 65% of Hispanic/Latinos met the aerobic component of 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Men and individuals of Puerto Rican background had the most minutes/day of leisure-time MVPA (30.3 and 30.2, respectively). Individuals of Puerto Rican and Dominican background had the most minutes/day of transportation-related PA (48.7 and 39.7, respectively). Individuals of Mexican and Central American background had the most minutes/day of work-related MVPA (90.7 and 93.2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among Hispanics/Latinos, self-reported data provided information on the type of PA and helped explain variability identified from accelerometer-assessed PA. These findings highlight variability in PA among Hispanics from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Copyright _ 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1299,"A method for estimating urban background concentrations in support of hybrid air pollution modeling for environmental health studies Exposure studies rely on detailed characterization of air quality, either from sparsely located routine ambient monitors or from central monitoring sites that may lack spatial representativeness. Alternatively, some studies use models of various complexities to characterize local-scale air quality, but often with poor representation of background concentrations. A hybrid approach that addresses this drawback combines a regional-scale model to provide background concentrations and a local-scale model to assess impacts of local sources. However, this approach may double-count sources in the study regions. To address these limitations, we carefully define the background concentration as the concentration that would be measured if local sources were not present, and to estimate these background concentrations we developed a novel technique that combines space-time ordinary kriging (STOK) of observations with outputs from a detailed chemistry-transport model with local sources zeroed out. We applied this technique to support an exposure study in Detroit, Michigan, for several pollutants (including NOx and PM2.5), and evaluated the estimated hybrid concentrations (calculated by combining the background estimates that addresses this issue of double counting with local-scale dispersion model estimates) using observations. Our results demonstrate the strength of this approach specifically by eliminating the problem of double-counting reported in previous hybrid modeling approaches leading to improved estimates of background concentrations, and further highlight the relative importance of NOx vs. PM2.5 in their relative contributions to total concentrations. While a key limitation of this approach is the requirement for another detailed model simulation to avoid double-counting, STOK improves the overall characterization of background concentrations at very fine spatial scales.",,,1,,,
1300,"Effect of hawthorn standardized extract on flow mediated dilation in prehypertensive and mildly hypertensive adults: a randomized, controlled cross-over trial BACKGROUND: Hawthorn extract has been used for cardiovascular diseases for centuries. Recent trials have demonstrated its efficacy for the treatment of heart failure, and the results of several small trials suggest it may lower blood pressure. However, there is little published evidence to guide its dosing. The blood pressure lowering effect of hawthorn has been linked to nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hawthorn extract dose and brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD), an indirect measure of nitric oxide release. METHODS: We used a four-period cross-over design to evaluate brachial artery FMD in response to placebo or hawthorn extract (standardized to 50 mg oligomeric procyanidin per 250 mg extract). Randomly sequenced doses of hawthorn extract (1000 mg, 1500 mg, and 2500 mg) and placebo were assigned to each participant. Doses were taken twice daily for 3 1/2 days followed by FMD and a 4-day washout before proceeding to the next dosing period. RESULTS: Twenty-one prehypertensive or mildly hypertensive adults completed the study. There was no evidence of a dose-response effect for our main outcome (FMD percent) or any of our secondary outcomes (absolute change in brachial artery diameter and blood pressure). Most participants indicated that if given evidence that hawthorn could lower their blood pressure, they would be likely to use it either in conjunction with or instead of lifestyle modification or anti-hypertensive medications. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of a dose-response effect of hawthorn extract on FMD. If hawthorn has a blood pressure lowering effect, it is likely to be mediated via an NO-independent mechanism. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health: NCT01331486.",,,1,,,
1301,"A geographic information system analysis of the impact of a statewide acute stroke emergency medical services routing protocol on community hospital bypass BACKGROUND: Our goal was to determine if a statewide Emergency Medical Services (EMSs) Stroke Triage and Destination Plan (STDP), specifying bypass of hospitals unable to routinely treat stroke patients with thrombolytics (community hospitals), changed bypass frequency of those hospitals. METHODS: Using a statewide EMS database, we identified stroke patients eligible for community hospital bypass and compared bypass frequency 1-year before and after STDP implementation. RESULTS: Symptom onset time was missing for 48% of pre-STDP (n = 2385) and 29% of post-STDP (n = 1612) cases. Of the remaining cases with geocodable scene addresses, 58% (1301) in the pre-STDP group and 61% (2,078) in the post-STDP group were ineligible for bypass, because a community hospital was not the closest hospital to the stroke event location. Because of missing data records for some EMS agencies in 1 or both study periods, we included EMS agencies from only 49 of 100 North Carolina counties in our analysis. Additionally, we found conflicting hospital classifications by different EMS agencies for 35% of all hospitals (n = 38 of 108). Given these limitations, we found similar community hospital bypass rates before and after STDP implementation (64%, n = 332 of 520 vs. 63%, n = 345 of 552; P = .65). CONCLUSIONS: Missing symptom duration time and data records in our state's EMS data system, along with conflicting hospital classifications between EMS agencies limit the ability to study statewide stroke routing protocols. Bypass policies may apply to a minority of patients because a community hospital is not the closest hospital to most stroke events. Given these limitations, we found no difference in community hospital bypass rates after implementation of the STDP. Copyright _ 2014 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1302,"Out-of-hospital stroke screen accuracy in a state with an emergency medical services protocol for routing patients to acute stroke centers STUDY OBJECTIVE: Emergency medical services (EMS) protocols, which route patients with suspected stroke to stroke centers, rely on the use of accurate stroke screening criteria. Our goal is to conduct a statewide EMS agency evaluation of the accuracies of the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) and the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) for identifying acute stroke patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in North Carolina by linking a statewide EMS database to a hospital database, using validated deterministic matching. We compared EMS CPSS or LAPSS results (positive or negative) to the emergency department diagnosis International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for the EMS diagnosis of stroke, using each screening tool. RESULTS: We included 1,217 CPSS patients and 1,225 LAPSS patients evaluated by 117 EMS agencies from 94 North Carolina counties. Most EMS agencies contributing data had high annual patient volumes and were governmental agencies with nonvolunteer, emergency medical technician-paramedic service level providers. The CPSS had a sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77% to 83%) versus 74% (95% CI 71% to 77%) for the LAPSS. Each had a specificity of 48% (CPSS 95% CI 44% to 52%; LAPSS 95% CI 43% to 53%). CONCLUSION: The CPSS and LAPSS had similar test characteristics, with each having only limited specificity. Development of stroke screening scales that optimize both sensitivity and specificity is required if these are to be used to determine transport diversion to acute stroke centers. Copyright _ 2014.

1303,"Associations between biomarkers of joint metabolism, hand osteoarthritis, and hand pain and function: the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations between joint metabolism biomarkers and hand radiographic osteoarthritis [(rOA), based on Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grade _ 2], symptoms, and function. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were available for 663 participants (mean age 63 yrs, 63% white, 49% women). Three definitions of hand rOA were considered: (1) a composite measure involving at least 3 hand joints distributed bilaterally with 2 of 3 in the same joint group, including _ 1 distal interphalangeal joint, without metacarpophalangeal (MCP) swelling; (2) rOA in at least 1 joint of a group; and (3) number of joints with KL _ 2. We assessed hand symptoms and the 15-item Australian Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN; Likert format). We measured serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), hyaluronic acid (sHA), carboxy-terminal propeptide of type II collagen, type II collagen degradation product, urinary C-terminal crosslinked telopeptide of type II collagen, and urinary N-terminal crosslinked telopeptide. Linear regression models were performed to assess associations between each biomarker with hand rOA, AUSCAN, and symptoms, adjusting for age, sex, race, current smoking/drinking status, body mass index, and hip and knee rOA. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, MCP (p < 0.0001) and carpometacarpal rOA (p = 0.003), and a higher number of hand joints with rOA (p = 0.009), were associated with higher levels of sHA. Positive associations were seen between AUSCAN and hand symptoms and levels of sCOMP (p _ 0.003) and sHA (p _ 0.048). CONCLUSION: Hand symptoms and higher AUSCAN scores were independently associated with higher levels of both sCOMP and sHA; hand rOA was associated only with sHA levels.",,,9,,,
1304,"Association of pro-inflammatory high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with clinical and laboratory variables in sickle cell disease Background Although cholesterol levels are known to be decreased in sickle cell disease (SCD), the level of pro-inflammatory high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (proHDL) and its association with clinical complications and laboratory variables has not been evaluated. Design and methods Plasma levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), proHDL, and selected clinical and laboratory variables were ascertained in a cohort of SCD patients and healthy African American control subjects in this single-center, cross-sectional study. Results Although total cholesterol was significantly lower in SCD patients compared with control subjects, HDL and proHDL levels were similar in both the SCD and control groups. In univariate analyses, proHDL was correlated with echocardiography-derived tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity. ProHDL was higher in SCD patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension (PHT) compared to patients without suspected PHT. ProHDL was positively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, prothrombin fragment 1+2, D-dimer, and thrombin-antithrombin complexes. In multivariable analyses, only higher lactate dehydrogenase and direct bilirubin levels were associated with higher levels of proHDL. Conclusions SCD is characterized by hypocholesterolemia. Although proHDL is not increased in SCD patients compared with healthy controls, it is significantly associated with markers of liver disease. In addition, proHDL is associated with tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and markers of coagulation, although these associations are not significant in multivariable analyses.",,,1,,,

1306,"Using an improved phagocytosis assay to evaluate the effect of HIV on specific antibodies to pregnancy-associated malaria BACKGROUND: Pregnant women residing in malaria endemic areas are highly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, particularly during their first pregnancy, resulting in low birth weight babies and maternal anaemia. This susceptibility is associated with placental sequestration of parasitised red blood cells expressing pregnancy-specific variant surface antigens. Acquisition of antibodies against these variant surface antigens may protect women and their offspring. Functions of such antibodies may include prevention of placental sequestration or opsonisation of parasitised cells for phagocytic clearance. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Here we report the development and optimisation of a new high-throughput flow cytometry-based phagocytosis assay using undifferentiated Thp-1 cells to quantitate the amount of opsonizing antibody in patient sera, and apply this assay to measure the impact of HIV on the levels of antibodies to a pregnancy malaria-associated parasite line in a cohort of Malawian primigravid women. The assay showed high reproducibility, with inter-experimental correlation of r(2) = 0.99. In primigravid women, concurrent malaria infection was associated with significantly increased antibodies, whereas HIV decreased the ability to acquire opsonising antibodies (Mann-Whitney ranksum: p = 0.013). This decrease was correlated with HIV-induced immunosuppression, with women with less than 350 x 10(6) CD4+ T- cells/L having less opsonising antibodies (coef: -11.95,P = 0.002). Levels of antibodies were not associated with protection from low birth weight or anaemia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This flow cytometry-based phagocytosis assay proved to be efficient and accurate for the measurement of Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis-inducing antibodies in large cohorts. HIV was found to affect mainly the acquisition of antibodies to pregnancy-specific malaria in primigravidae. Further studies of the relationship between opsonising antibodies to malaria in pregnancy and HIV are indicated.",,,6,,,
1307,"High prevalence of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in women on antiretroviral therapy in Cameroon: Is targeted screening feasible? BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women in low-income countries. Although cervical cancer incidence and mortality is higher in HIV-positive women, resource limitations restrict the implementation of systematic screening programs in these women. We explored the potential for targeted screening by assessing the prevalence, severity and predictors of cervical squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SILs) in HIV-positive women in Cameroon. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of women on antiretroviral therapy in Cameroon. Socio-demographic, behavioral, and clinical information was obtained from eligible women. Cervical exfoliated cells were then collected, a conventional cytology performed and epithelial lesions classified according to the Bethesda 2001 system. A total of 282 women, aged 19-68 years, were enrolled in this study. The median CD4 count was 179 cells/microliter (interquartile range: 100-271). SILs were detected in 43.5% of the 276 women with satisfactory samples: including atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS) 0.7%, low-grade SIL (LSIL) 25.0%, atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade lesions (ASC-H) 14.5%, and high-grade SIL (HSIL) 3.3%. None of the demographic or clinical characteristics considered significantly predicted the presence of any SILs or the presence of severe lesions requiring colposcopy. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SIL in women on antiretroviral therapy in Cameroon was high underscoring the need for screening and care in this population. In the absence of any accurate demographic or clinical predictor of SIL, targeted screening does not seem feasible. Alternative affordable screening options need to be explored.

1309,"Bridging the dental-medical divide: Case studies integrating oral health care and primary health care BACKGROUND: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine commissioned an environmental scan describing the status of health care integration of oral health and primary care services. METHODS: The authors conducted an environmental scan of US integration activities with publications from January 2000 through August 2017. They categorized services as preventive oral health services (POHS) provided by medical care providers, POHS provided by dental providers in nondental settings, preventive health services provided by dental providers, or care coordination using dedicated personnel and technology. The authors chose 4 programs as case studies and interviewed key personnel in each program. One case study illustrates each category of integrated services; additional examples describe category variation. RESULTS: The case study involving Into the Mouth of Babes illustrates medical professionals delivering POHS to children. The case study involving Grace Health presents dental hygienists embedded in the obstetrics-gynecology clinic to provide oral screening, prophylaxis, and education to pregnant women. At HealthPartners, medical care providers refer patients with diabetes to dentists and waive copays for periodontal care. The InterCommunity Health Network Coordinated Care Organization uses dedicated patient coordinators, technology, and coordinated payment and referral mechanisms to facilitate care. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of dental and medical care increased access to and coordination of patient care by means of offering health care services traditionally provided by the other profession. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Integration models demonstrate the incorporation of POHS by primary care professionals, the embedding of dental professionals into primary care clinics, and the incorporation of care coordination to increase the delivery of oral health care. Similarly, dentists identify and refer patients with medical needs or preventive gaps to medical homes. Copyright _ 2018 American Dental Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1310,"Delivering maternal mental health through peer volunteers: a 5-year report Background: Maternal depression affects one in five_women in low-and middle income countries (LMIC) and has significant economic and social impacts. Evidence-based psychosocial interventions delivered by non-specialist health workers are recommended as first-line management of the condition, and recent studies on such interventions from LMIC show promising results. However, lack of human resource to deliver the interventions is a major bottle-neck to scale-up, and much research attention has been devoted to 'task-sharing' initiatives. A peer-delivered version of the World Health Organization's Thinking Healthy Programme for perinatal depression in Pakistan and India showed clinical, functional and social benefits to women at 3_months postpartum. The programme has been iteratively adapted and continually delivered for 5_years in Pakistan. In this report, we describe the extended intervention and factors contributing to the peers' continued motivation and retention, and suggest future directions to address scale-up challenges. Methods: The study was conducted in rural Rawalpindi. We used mixed methods to evaluate the programme 5_years since its initiation. The competency of the peers in delivering the intervention was evaluated using a specially developed Quality and Competency Checklist, an observational tool used by trainers to rate a group session on key areas of competencies. In-depth interviews explored factors contributing to the peer volunteers' continued motivation and retention, as well as the key challenges faced. Results: Our key findings are that about 70% of the peer volunteers inducted 5_years ago continued to be part of the programme, retaining their competency in delivering the intervention, with only token financial incentives. Factors contributing to sustained motivation included altruistic aspirations, enhanced social standing in the community, personal benefits to their own mental health, and the possibility for other avenues of employment. Long-term challenges included demotivation due to lack of certainty about the programme's future, increased requirement for financial incentivisation, the logistics of organising groups in the community, and resistance from some families to the need for ongoing care. Conclusions: The programme, given the sustained motivation and competence of peer volunteers in delivering the intervention, has the potential for long-term sustainability in under-resourced settings and a candidate for scale-up.",,,2,,,
1311,"The level of association between functional performance status measures and patient-reported outcomes in cancer patients: a systematic review PURPOSE: The process of assessing patient symptoms and functionality using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and functional performance status (FPS) is an essential aspect of patient-centered oncology research and care. However, PRO and FPS measures are often employed separately or inconsistently combined. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the level of association between PRO and FPS measures to determine their differential or combined utility. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using five databases (1966 to February 2014) to identify studies that described an association between PRO and FPS. Studies were excluded if they were non-cancer specific, did not include adults aged 18 or older, or were review articles. Publications were selected for review by consensus among two authors, with a third author arbitrating as needed. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies met inclusion criteria. FPS was primarily assessed by clinicians using the ECOG Performance Status or Karnofsky Performance Status measures. PROs were captured using a variety of measures, with numerous domains assessed (e.g., pain, fatigue, and general health status). Concordance between PROs and FPS measures was widely variable, falling in the low to moderate range (0.09-0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Despite consistency in the method of capture of PROs or FPS, domain capture varied considerably across reviewed studies. Irrespective of the method of capturing PROs or FPS, the quantified level of association between these two areas was moderate at best, providing evidence that FPS and PRO assessments offer unique information to assist clinicians in their decision-making.",,,1,,,
1312,"Measurement of affective and activity pain interference using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): Cancer and Leukemia Group B 70903 OBJECTIVE: The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was designed to yield separate scores for pain intensity and interference. It has been proposed that the pain interference factor can be further broken down into unique factors of affective (e.g., mood) and activity (e.g., work) interference. The purpose of this analysis was to confirm this affective/activity interference dichotomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective confirmatory factor analysis was completed for a sample of 184 individuals diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (age 40-86, mean_=_65.46, 77% White non-Hispanic) who had been administered the BPI as part of Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 9480. A one-factor model was compared against two-factor and three-factor models that were developed based on the design of the instrument. RESULTS: Root mean squared error of approximation (0.075), comparative fit index (0.971), and change in chi-square, given the corresponding change in degrees of freedom (13.33, P_< _0.05) values for the three-factor model (i.e., pain intensity, activity interference, and affective interference), were statistically superior in comparison with the one- and two-factor models. This three-factor structure was found to be invariant across age, mean prostate-specific antigen, and hemoglobin levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that the BPI can be used to quantify the degree to which pain separately interferes with affective and activity aspects of a patient's everyday life. These findings will provide clinical trialists, pharmaceutical sponsors, and regulators with confidence in the flexibility of the BPI as they consider the use of this instrument to assist with understanding the patient experience as it relates to treatment.

1313,"Using confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate construct validity of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) CONTEXT: The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a frequently used instrument designed to assess the patient-reported outcome of pain. The majority of factor analytic studies have found a two-factor (i.e., pain intensity and pain interference) structure for this instrument; however, because the BPI was developed with an a priori hypothesis of the relationship among its items, it follows that construct validity investigations should use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to establish the construct validity of the BPI using a CFA framework and demonstrate factorial invariance using a range of demographic variables. METHODS: A retrospective CFA was completed in a sample of individuals diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and cancer (n=364; 63% male; age 21-92 years, M=51.80). A baseline one-factor model was compared against two-factor and three-factor models (i.e., pain intensity, activity interference, and affective interference) that were developed based on the hypothetical design of the instrument. RESULTS: Fit indices for the three-factor model were statistically superior when compared with the one-factor model and marginally better when compared with the two-factor model. This three-factor structure was found to be invariant across disease, age, and ethnicity groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence to support a three-factor representation of the BPI, and the originally hypothesized two-factor structure. Such findings will begin to provide clinical trialists, pharmaceutical sponsors, and regulators with confidence in the psychometric properties of this instrument when considering its inclusion in clinical research.

1314,"Patient-Reported Physical Function Measures in Cancer Clinical Trials Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly used to monitor treatment-related symptoms and physical function decrements in cancer clinical trials. As more patients enter survivorship, it is important to capture PRO physical function throughout trials to help restore pretreatment levels of function. We completed a systematic review of PRO physical function measures used in cancer clinical trials and evaluated their psychometric properties on the basis of guidelines from the US Food and Drug Administration. Five databases were searched through October 2015: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Health and Psychosocial Instruments, and Cochrane. From an initial total of 10,233 articles, we identified 108 trials that captured PRO physical function. Within these trials, approximately 67% used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and 25% used the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. Both the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 instruments generically satisfy most Food and Drug Administration requirements, although neither sought direct patient input as part of item development. The newer Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function short form may be a brief, viable alternative. Clinicians should carefully consider the psychometric properties of these measures when incorporating PRO instrumentation into clinical trial design to provide a more comprehensive understanding of patient function. _ The Author 2017.

1315,"Multilevel examination of diabetes in modernising China: what elements of urbanisation are most associated with diabetes? AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between urbanisation-related factors and diabetes prevalence in China. METHODS: Anthropometry, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and community-level data were collected for 7,741 adults (18-90_years) across 217 communities and nine provinces in the 2009 China Health and Nutrition Survey to examine diabetes (FBG _7.0_mmol/l or doctor diagnosis). Sex-stratified multilevel models, clustered at the community and province levels and controlling for individual-level age and household income were used to examine the association between diabetes and: (1) a multicomponent urbanisation measure reflecting overall modernisation and (2) 12 separate components of urbanisation (e.g., population density, employment, markets, infrastructure and social factors). RESULTS: Prevalent diabetes was higher in more-urbanised (men 12%; women 9%) vs less-urbanised (men 6%; women 5%) areas. In sex-stratified multilevel models adjusting for residential community and province, age and household income, there was a twofold higher diabetes prevalence in urban vs rural areas (men OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.47, 2.78; women, OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.35, 2.79). All urbanisation components were positively associated with diabetes, with variation across components (e.g. men, economic and income diversity, OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20, 1.66; women, transportation infrastructure, OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06, 1.32). Community-level variation in diabetes was comparatively greater for women (intraclass correlation [ICC] 0.03-0.05) vs men (ICC _0.01); province-level variation was greater for men (men 0.03-0.04; women 0.02). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes prevention and treatment efforts are needed particularly in urbanised areas of China. Community economic factors, modern markets, communications and transportation infrastructure might present opportunities for such efforts.",,,4,,,
1316,"Implications of iron deficiency/anemia on the classification of diabetes using HbA1c BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nonglycemic factors like iron deficiency (ID) or anemia may interfere with classification of diabetes and prediabetes using hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). However, few population-based studies of diabetes in areas with endemic ID/anemia have been conducted. We aimed to determine how mutually exclusive categories of ID alone, anemia alone and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) were each associated with prediabetes and diabetes prevalence using fasting blood glucose (FBG) versus HbA1c in a population-based study of adults with endemic ID/anemia. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We used data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a longitudinal, population-based study across 228 communities within nine provinces of China. This analysis included 7308 adults seen in the 2009 survey aged 18-75 years. We used descriptive and covariate-adjusted models to examine relative risk of prediabetes and diabetes using FBG alone, HbA1c alone, HbA1c and FBG, or neither (normoglycemia) by anemia alone, ID alone, IDA or normal iron/hemoglobin. RESULTS: Approximately 65% of individuals with diabetes in our sample were concordantly classified with diabetes using both FBG and HbA1c, while 35% had a discordant diabetes classification: they were classified using either FBG or HbA1c, but not both. Fewer participants with ID alone versus normal iron/hemoglobin were classified with diabetes using HbA1c only. From covariate-adjusted, multinomial regression analyses, the adjusted prevalence of prediabetes using HbA1c only was 22% for men with anemia alone, but 13% for men with normal iron/hemoglobin. In contrast, the predicted prevalence of prediabetes using HbA1c only was 8% for women with ID alone, compared with 13% for women with normal iron/hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest potential misclassification of diabetes using HbA1c in areas of endemic ID/anemia. Estimating diabetes prevalence using HbA1c may result in under-diagnosis in women with ID and over-diagnosis in men with anemia.",,,4,,,
1317,"Associations between age, cohort, and urbanization with SBP and DBP in China: a population-based study across 18 years OBJECTIVE: Little is known about whether large-scale environmental changes, such as those seen with urbanization, are differentially associated with SBP versus DBP, and whether those changes vary by birth cohort. METHODS: We used data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a population-based cohort study of Chinese adults (n_=_18_754 aged 18-70 years), seen a maximum of seven times from 1991 to 2009. We used hierarchical multivariable linear models to simultaneously estimate SBP and DBP as correlated outcomes over time, accounting for their physiologic, time-varying correlation. Main exposure variables were urbanicity, age, and birth cohort. Over 18 years of modernization, median SBP and DBP increased by 10 and 7__mHg, respectively. RESULTS: Our hierarchical model results suggest greater temporal increases in SBP and particularly DBP at lower versus higher urbanicity. At the same chronological age, for a 10-year difference in birth cohort (i.e. born in 1980s versus 1970s), the adjusted mean DBP was approximately 3__mHg higher for the later birth cohort (P_< _0.001). Pulse pressure (calculated as model-predicted SBP minus DBP) was also higher at low versus high urbanicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest increased susceptibility of DBP (and thus peripheral vascular resistance) to environmental change, particularly in younger Chinese adults. Because DBP more strongly predicts cardiovascular disease risk in younger adulthood, hypertension-related health burden in China may increase over time.",,,3,,,
1318,"Differential associations of urbanicity and income with physical activity in adults in urbanizing China: findings from the population-based China Health and Nutrition Survey 1991-2009 BACKGROUND: High urbanicity and income are risk factors for cardiovascular-related chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries, perhaps due to low physical activity (PA) in urban, high income areas. Few studies have examined differences in PA over time according to income and urbanicity in a country experiencing rapid urbanization. METHODS: We used data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a population-based cohort of Chinese adults (n_=_20,083; ages 18-75y) seen a maximum of 7 times from 1991-2009. We used sex-stratified, zero-inflated negative binomial regression models to examine occupational, domestic, leisure, travel, and total PA in Chinese adults according to year, urbanicity, income, and the interactions among urbanicity, income, and year, controlling for age and region of China. RESULTS: We showed larger mean temporal PA declines for individuals living in relatively low urbanicity areas (1991: 500 MET-hours/week; 2009: 300 MET-hours/week) compared to high urbanicity areas (1991: 200 MET-hours/week; 2009: 125 MET-hours/week). In low urbanicity areas, the association between income and total PA went from negative in 1991 (p_< _0.05) to positive by 2000 (p_< _0.05). In relatively high urbanicity areas, the income-PA relationship was positive at all time points and was statistically significant at most time points after 1997 (p_< _0.05). Leisure PA was the only domain of PA that increased over time, but >95% of individuals in low urbanicity areas reported zero leisure PA at each time point. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show changing associations for income and urbanicity with PA over 18 years of urbanization. Total PA was lower for individuals living in more versus less urban areas at all time points. However, these differences narrowed over time, which may relate to increases in individual-level income in less urban areas of China with urbanization. Low-income individuals in higher urbanicity areas are a particularly critical group to target to increase PA in China.",,,9,,,
1319,"Plasma levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) predict radiographic progression of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis OBJECTIVE: Pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1_ and IL1Ra, are produced by joint tissues in osteoarthritis (OA), where they may contribute to pathogenesis. We examined whether inflammatory events occurring within joints are reflected in plasma of patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (SKOA). DESIGN: 111 SKOA subjects with medial disease completed a 24-month prospective study of clinical and radiographic progression, with clinical assessment and specimen collection at 6-month intervals. The plasma biochemical marker IL1Ra was assessed at baseline and 18 months; other plasma biochemical markers were assessed only at 18 months, including IL-1_, TNF_, VEGF, IL-6, IL-6R_, IL-17A, IL-17A/F, IL-17F, CRP, sTNF-RII, and MMP-2. RESULTS: In cross-sectional studies, WOMAC (total, pain, function) and plasma IL1Ra were modestly associated with radiographic severity after adjustment for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). In addition, elevation of plasma IL1Ra predicted joint space narrowing (JSN) at 24 months. BMI did associate with progression in some but not all analyses. Causal graph analysis indicated a positive association of IL1Ra with JSN; an interaction between IL1Ra and BMI suggested either that BMI influences IL1Ra or that a hidden confounder influences both BMI and IL1Ra. Other protein biomarkers examined in this study did not associate with radiographic progression or severity. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of IL1Ra were modestly associated with the severity and progression of SKOA in a causal fashion, independent of other risk factors. The findings may be useful in the search for prognostic biomarkers and development of disease-modifying OA drugs. Copyright _ 2015 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

1320,"Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) gene variants predict radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis and risk of incident disease OBJECTIVE: In these studies, we examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL1RN gene with radiographic severity of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (SKOA) and the risk of incident OA. We also explored these genetic polymorphisms in patients with new onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Over 1000 subjects who met American College of Rheumatology criteria for tibiofemoral OA were selected from three independent, National Institute of Health (NIH)-funded cohorts. CTA and TTG haplotypes formed from three SNPs of the IL1RN gene (rs419598, rs315952, rs9005) were assessed for association with radiographic severity, and risk for incident radiographic OA (rOA) in a nested case-control cohort. These IL1RN haplotypes were also assessed for association with disease activity (DAS28) and plasma inflammatory markers in patients with RA. RESULTS: Carriage of the IL1RN TTG haplotype was associated with increased odds of more severe rOA compared with age-matched, sex-matched and body mass index-matched individuals. Examination of the osteoarthritis initiative Incidence Subcohort demonstrated that carriage of the TTG haplotype was associated with 4.1-fold (p=0.001) increased odds of incident rOA. Plasma IL-1Ra levels were lower in TTG carriers, while chondrocytes from TTG carriers exhibited decreased secretion of IL-1Ra. In patients with RA, the TTG haplotype was associated with increased DAS28, decreased plasma IL-1Ra and elevations of plasma inflammatory markers (hsCRP, interleukin 6 (IL-6)). CONCLUSION: Carriage of the IL1RN TTG haplotype is associated with more severe rOA, increased risk for incident OA, and increased evidence of inflammation in RA. These data suggest that the IL1RN TTG risk haplotype, associated with decreased IL-1Ra plasma levels, impairs endogenous 'anti-inflammatory' mechanisms. _ Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

1321,"Imputation of exome sequence variants into population- based samples and blood-cell-trait-associated loci in African Americans: NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project Researchers have successfully applied exome sequencing to discover causal variants in selected individuals with familial, highly penetrant disorders. We demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing followed by imputation for discovering low-frequency variants associated with complex quantitative traits. We performed exome sequencing in a reference panel of 761 African Americans and then imputed newly discovered variants into a larger sample of more than 13,000 African Americans for association testing with the blood cell traits hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood count, and platelet count. First, we illustrate the feasibility of our approach by demonstrating genome-wide-significant associations for variants that are not covered by conventional genotyping arrays; for example, one such association is that between higher platelet count and an MPL c.117G>T (p.Lys39Asn) variant encoding a p.Lys39Asn amino acid substitution of the thrombopoietin receptor gene (p = 1.5 _ 10(-11)). Second, we identified an association between missense variants of LCT and higher white blood count (p = 4 _ 10(-13)). Third, we identified low-frequency coding variants that might account for allelic heterogeneity at several known blood cell-associated loci: MPL c.754T>C (p.Tyr252His) was associated with higher platelet count; CD36 c.975T>G (p.Tyr325(_)) was associated with lower platelet count; and several missense variants at the _-globin gene locus were associated with lower hemoglobin. By identifying low-frequency missense variants associated with blood cell traits not previously reported by genome-wide association studies, we establish that exome sequencing followed by imputation is a powerful approach to dissecting complex, genetically heterogeneous traits in large population-based studies.

1322,"Puberty-specific promotion of mammary tumorigenesis by a high animal fat diet INTRODUCTION: Increased animal fat consumption is associated with increased premenopausal breast cancer risk in normal weight, but not overweight, women. This agrees with our previous findings in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice, in which exposure to a high saturated animal fat diet (HFD) from peripuberty through adulthood promoted mammary tumorigenesis. Epidemiologic and animal studies support the importance of puberty as a life stage when diet and environmental exposures affect adult breast cancer risk. In this study, we identified the effects of peripubertal exposure to HFD and investigated its mechanism of enhancing tumorigenesis. METHODS: Three-week-old BALB/c mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD were subjected to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced carcinogenesis. At 9_weeks of age, half the mice on LFD were switched to HFD (LFD-HFD group) and half the mice on HFD were switched to LFD (HFD-LFD group). Tumor gene expression was evaluated in association with diet and tumor latency. RESULTS: The peripubertal HFD reduced the latency of DMBA-induced mammary tumors and was associated with tumor characteristics similar to those in mice fed a continuous HFD. Notably, short-latency tumors in both groups shared gene expression characteristics and were more likely to have adenosquamous histology. Both HFD-LFD and continuous HFD tumors showed similar gene expression patterns and early latency. Adult switch from HFD to LFD did not reverse peripubertal HFD tumor promotion. Increased proliferation, hyperplasia, and macrophages were present in mammary glands before tumor development, implicating these as possible effectors of tumor promotion. Despite a significant interaction between pubertal diet and carcinogens in tumor promotion, peripubertal HFD by itself produced persistent macrophage recruitment to mammary glands. CONCLUSIONS: In obesity-resistant mice, peripubertal HFD is sufficient to irreversibly promote carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. Increased macrophage recruitment is likely a contributing factor. These results underscore the importance of early life exposures to increased adult cancer risk and are consistent with findings that an HFD in normal weight premenopausal women leads to increased breast cancer risk. Notably, short-latency tumors occurring after peripubertal HFD had characteristics similar to human basal-like breast cancers that predominantly develop in younger women.",,,3,,,
1323,"Tumor expression of environmental chemical-responsive genes and breast cancer mortality Environmental phenols and phthalates are common ingredients in personal care products and some have been implicated in breast cancer progression. We have previously identified genes differentially expressed in response to low-dose exposure to diethyl phthalate (DEP) and methyl paraben (MPB) in a rat model. Herein we explore if these genes are associated with breast cancer mortality in humans. We profiled MPB- and DEP-responsive genes in tumors by NanoString_ from a population-based cohort of 606 women with first primary breast cancer among whom 119 breast cancer-specific deaths occurred within 15+ years of follow-up. For each gene, Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results were validated in two publicly available datasets. The following results were obtained. From 107 DEP- and 77 MPB-responsive genes profiled, 44 and 30 genes, respectively, were significantly associated with breast cancer-specific mortality. Some top DEP-responsive genes are novel for breast cancer mortality, such as ABHD14B (for high-vs-low expression, HR 0.36, 95% CI: 0.2-0.5) and TMC4 (HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.3-0.5); top hits for MPB (SLC40A1 (HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.3-0.5) and NTN4 (HR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6)) are well-known predictors of breast cancer survival. PLEKHA6 was another novel survival predictor, sensitive to hormonal receptor status (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9 for hormonal receptor-positive and HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.7-6.2 for -negative group). In conclusion, tumor expression of DEP- and MPB-responsive genes is associated with breast cancer mortality, supporting that exposure to these chemicals may influence the progression of breast cancer.",,,3,,,
1324,"Novel Predictors of Breast Cancer Survival Derived from miRNA Activity Analysis Purpose: Breast cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related death; discovery of novel prognostic markers is needed to improve outcomes. Combining systems biology and epidemiology, we investigated miRNA-associated genes and breast cancer survival in a well-characterized population-based study.Experimental Design: A recently developed algorithm, ActMiR, was used to identify key miRNA ""activities"" corresponding to target gene degradation, which were predictive of breast cancer mortality in published databases. We profiled miRNA-associated genes in tumors from our well-characterized population-based cohort of 606 women with first primary breast cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI), after 15+ years of follow-up with 119 breast cancer-specific deaths.Results: miR-500a activity was identified as a key miRNA for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer mortality using public databases. From a panel of 161 miR-500a-associated genes profiled, 73 were significantly associated with breast cancer-specific mortality (FDR < 0.05) in our population, among which two clusters were observed to have opposing directions of association. For example, high level of SUSD3 was associated with reduced breast cancer-specific mortality (HR = 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.4), whereas the opposite was observed for TPX2 (HR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.9). Most importantly, we identified set of genes for which associations with breast cancer-specific mortality were independent of known prognostic factors, including hormone receptor status and PAM50-derived risk-of-recurrence scores. These results are validated in independent datasets.Conclusions: We identified novel markers that may improve prognostic efficiency while shedding light on molecular mechanisms of breast cancer progression.

1325,"Incidence of injury, maltreatment, and developmental disorders among substance exposed infants Recent changes to federal legislation created a requirement for states to address the needs of infants with prenatal substance exposure. Understanding clinical outcomes among substance exposed infants prior to these changes is important for establishing a baseline of risk and informing systems-level responses. Using North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas Medicaid data, we examined the incidence of inpatient and outpatient diagnoses for injury, maltreatment, and developmental disorders prior to age 12 months and compared types of diagnoses among substance exposed and unexposed infants. The cumulative incidence of maltreatment (1.2% vs. 0.2%) and developmental disorder (10.7% vs. 1.5%) diagnoses prior to age 12 months was significantly higher among substance exposed compared to unexposed infants. The incidence of injury diagnoses was similar (3.7% vs. 3.4%). We observed differences in types of maltreatment and injury diagnoses. For example, diagnoses for neglect were more common among substance exposed infants while diagnoses for physical abuse were more common among unexposed infants. Results provide insight for informing monitoring and intervention by medical and public health professionals.",,,3,,,

1327,"Heterogeneity in Risk and Protection Among Alaska Native/American Indian and Non-Native Children Currently, little is known about patterns of co-occurring risk and protective factors among young children. Understanding variations in co-occurring risk and protective factors among children in Alaska is important as experiences of collective trauma may contribute to differences in the intersection of risk and protective factors between Alaska Native/American Indian (AN/AI) and non-Native children. Using data from the Alaska Longitudinal Child Abuse and Neglect Linkage (ALCANLink) project, a linkage of the 2009-2011 Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey and administrative data sources, and the 2012-2014 Childhood Understanding Behaviors Survey, we conducted latent class analysis to identify classes of AN/AI (N_=_593) and non-Native (N_=_1018) children in terms of seven risk factors (poverty, maternal depression, maternal binge drinking, parental incarceration, intimate partner violence exposure, other violence exposure, child maltreatment) and four protective factors (father figure involvement, reading by adults, family meals, peer interactions) experienced prior to age 3_years. We identified two classes among AN/AI children: (1) high risk-moderate protection (29.1%) and (2) low socioeconomic status-high protection (70.9%). We identified two classes among non-Native children: (1) moderate risk-high protection (32.9%) and (2) low risk-high protection (67.1%). A test of invariance revealed that risk and protective factor probabilities differed significantly for corresponding classes of AN/AI and non-Native children. Overall, results demonstrate heterogeneity within and between AN/AI and non-Native children in early experiences of risk and protection and suggest that interventions will be more effective if tailored to the experiences and developmental needs of specific groups of Alaska children.",,,3,,,

Alaska children are an important population for understanding patterns of CPS contact given high rates of contact overall and among specific demographic groups. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify longitudinal trajectory classes of CPS contact among Alaska Native/American Indian (AN/AI) and non-Native children and examine preconception and prenatal risk factors associated with identified classes. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: We used data from the Alaska Longitudinal Child Abuse and Neglect Linkage (ALCANLink) project, a linkage of 2009-2011 Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) births with administrative data including CPS records. METHODS: We conducted growth mixture modeling to identify trajectory classes of CPS contact from birth to age five years. We used Vermunt's three-step approach to examine associations with preconception and prenatal risk factors. RESULTS: Among AN/AI children, we identified three classes: 1) no/low CPS contact (75.4%); 2) continuous CPS contact (19.6%), and 3) early, decreasing CPS contact (5.0%). Among non-Native children, we identified four classes: 1) no CPS contact (81.3%); 2) low, increasing CPS contact (9.5%); 3) early, rapid decline CPS contact (5.8%); and 4) high, decreasing CPS contact (3.3%). Maternal substance use had the largest impact on probabilities of class membership, increasing the probability of membership in classes characterized by CPS contact, among both AN/AI and non-Native children.

We examined the incidence CPS contact using the Kaplan-Meier method and predictors of CPS contact using Cox proportional hazards regression. Using data from the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend and Child Death Review, we censored children who emigrated out-of-state or died during the study period. Significant predictors included low socioeconomic status (HR_=_2.23, 95% CI 1.68, 2.96), maternal smoking during pregnancy (HR_=_1.87, 95% CI 1.55, 2.24), unmarried maternal marital status (HR_=_1.62, 95% CI 1.31, 1.99), urban residence (HR_=_1.59, 95% CI 1.32, 1.92), lower maternal education (HR_=_1.54, 95% CI 1.24, 1.92), maternal experience of intimate partner violence in the 12 months before childbirth(HR_=_1.32, 95% CI 1.01, 1.74), Alaska Native/American Indian race (HR_=_1.40, 95% CI 1.15, 1.71), a greater number of living children (HR_=_1.20, 95% CI 1.13, 1.29), a greater number of stressful life eventsin the 12 months before childbirth (HR_=_1.16, 95% CI 1.11, 1.21), and younger maternal age at childbirth (HR_=_0.95, 95% CI 0.93, 0.97). Use of multiple linked data sources and time-to-event analysis methods adds to the growing literature regarding predictors of CPS contact. Results suggest that assessing for and addressing clinical, social, and environmental indicators during the prenatal period may aid prevention efforts in mitigating family need for involvement with CPS.

1331,"Association of childhood abuse and neglect with prescription opioid misuse: Examination of mediation by adolescent depressive symptoms and pain Previous research has demonstrated an association between childhood abuse and neglect and prescription opioid misuse in adulthood. However, potential mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Based on the self-medication hypothesis and the existing research literature, we hypothesized that pain and depressive symptoms would mediate this association. Data were from Waves I (1994_1995) and III (2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health; N_=_14,322). We conducted structural equation modeling to examine the association of childhood abuse and neglect with prescription opioid misuse in early adulthood and to assess for mediation by depressive symptoms and pain in adolescence.

1332,"Association of childhood abuse and prescription opioid use in early adulthood INTRODUCTION: Previous research has examined the association of childhood abuse with opioid misuse and dependence in adulthood. However, little research has focused specifically on prescription opioids, and no studies have examined associations with prescription opioid use, a potential pathway to later opioid misuse and dependence. The aim of the present study was to examine the association of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse with prescription opioid use in early adulthood. METHODS: We used data from Waves I (12-18years) and IV (24-32years) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. At Wave IV, respondents reported experiences of childhood abuse occurring prior to age 18years and prescription opioid use in the last four weeks. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to examine associations of childhood abuse with recent prescription opioid use. RESULTS: In multivariable models adjusted for respondent sex, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status, childhood emotional abuse (OR=1.57, 95% CI 1.29, 1.90), physical abuse (OR=1.46, 95% CI 1.14, 1.87), and any childhood abuse (OR=1.51, 95% CI 1.24, 1.82) were significantly associated with recent prescription opioid use. CONCLUSIONS: Given continued increases in prescription opioid use and opioid-related morbidity and mortality in the U.S., understanding upstream social and environmental factors associated with prescription opioid use is important to strengthening and expanding current prevention and intervention strategies. Future research is needed to examine factors potentially mediating the association between childhood abuse and prescription opioid use in order to provide additional insights for prevention and intervention efforts.

1333,"Association between physical activity and risk of stroke subtypes: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study BACKGROUND: The relationship between stroke subtypes and physical activity is unclear. METHODS: Using data from 13,069 men and women aged 45-64 years who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, physical activity was assessed by self-report using the Baecke questionnaire at baseline (1987-1989). The American Heart Association's ideal cardiovascular health guidelines served as a basis for the calculation of three physical activity categories: poor, intermediate, and ideal. Stroke and its subtypes were ascertained from physician review of medical records. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 18.8 years, a total of 648 incident ischemic strokes occurred. Significant inverse associations were found between physical activity categories and total, total ischemic, and nonlacunar stroke in adjusted models (age, sex, race-center, education, cigarette-years). Compared with poor physical activity, the adjusted HR (95% CI) for ideal physical activity were 0.78 (0.62-0.97) for total, 0.76 (0.59-0.96) for total ischemic, 0.85 (0.51-1.40) for lacunar, 0.77 (0.47-1.27) for cardioembolic, and 0.71 (0.51-0.99) for nonlacunar stroke. Additional adjustments for waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy and laboratory parameters attenuated the HR. Further sex- and race-specific analyses revealed that the association was predominantly observed among males and among African-Americans. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a tendency toward a reduced risk of total, total ischemic, and nonlacunar stroke with higher levels of physical activity. Copyright _ 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.",,,9,,,
1334,"Comparison of study designs used to detect and characterize pharmacogenomic interactions in nonexperimental studies: a simulation study OBJECTIVES: Adverse drug reactions are common, serious, difficult to predict, and may be influenced by genetics, prompting the increasing popularity of pharmacogenomic studies. Many pharmacogenomic studies are conducted in nonexperimental settings, yet little is known about the influence of confounding by contraindication. We, therefore, compared the two designs [the overall population (OPD) and the treated-only (TOD) design] by simulating a pharmacogenomic study of the ECG QT interval (QT). METHODS: Simulations were informed by data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and a literature review examining QT, QT-prolonging drug use, and modification by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Drug treatment was assigned on the basis of age, sex, and QTlong, representing confounding by contraindication. QT was simulated as a function of drug treatment, one SNP, the drug-SNP interaction, and clinical covariates. RESULTS: Failure to adjust for confounding by contraindication produced a varying degree of bias in the OPD, whereas the TOD was biased by the SNP main effect. For example, in the OPD, the false-positive proportion for the drug-SNP interaction was 5% across the range of SNP main effects (0-10 ms), but increased to 19% without adjusting for confounding by contraindication. In the TOD, the false-positive proportion increased to 89% with SNP main effects greater than 4 ms, although bias was reduced by 39% with adjustment for covariates affected by the SNP. CONCLUSION: The potential for bias from confounding by contraindication (OPD) should be weighed against bias from SNP main effects (TOD) when selecting the study design that best suits the given context.",,,8,,,
1335,"A phenomics-based strategy identifies loci on APOC1, BRAP, and PLCG1 associated with metabolic syndrome phenotype domains Despite evidence of the clustering of metabolic syndrome components, current approaches for identifying unifying genetic mechanisms typically evaluate clinical categories that do not provide adequate etiological information. Here, we used data from 19,486 European American and 6,287 African American Candidate Gene Association Resource Consortium participants to identify loci associated with the clustering of metabolic phenotypes. Six phenotype domains (atherogenic dyslipidemia, vascular dysfunction, vascular inflammation, pro-thrombotic state, central obesity, and elevated plasma glucose) encompassing 19 quantitative traits were examined. Principal components analysis was used to reduce the dimension of each domain such that >55% of the trait variance was represented within each domain. We then applied a statistically efficient and computational feasible multivariate approach that related eight principal components from the six domains to 250,000 imputed SNPs using an additive genetic model and including demographic covariates. In European Americans, we identified 606 genome-wide significant SNPs representing 19 loci. Many of these loci were associated with only one trait domain, were consistent with results in African Americans, and overlapped with published findings, for instance central obesity and FTO. However, our approach, which is applicable to any set of interval scale traits that is heritable and exhibits evidence of phenotypic clustering, identified three new loci in or near APOC1, BRAP, and PLCG1, which were associated with multiple phenotype domains. These pleiotropic loci may help characterize metabolic dysregulation and identify targets for intervention.",,,8,,,
1336,"Disparities in Early Transitions to Obesity in Contemporary Multi-Ethnic U.S. Populations BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined weight transitions in contemporary multi-ethnic populations spanning early childhood through adulthood despite the ability of such research to inform obesity prevention, control, and disparities reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized the ages at which African American, Caucasian, and Mexican American populations transitioned to overweight and obesity using contemporary and nationally representative cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (n = 21,220; aged 2-80 years). Age-, sex-, and race/ethnic-specific one-year net transition probabilities between body mass index-classified normal weight, overweight, and obesity were estimated using calibrated and validated Markov-type models that accommodated complex sampling. At age two, the obesity prevalence ranged from 7.3% in Caucasian males to 16.1% in Mexican American males. For all populations, estimated one-year overweight to obesity net transition probabilities peaked at age two and were highest for Mexican American males and African American females, for whom a net 12.3% (95% CI: 7.6%-17.0%) and 11.9% (95% CI: 8.5%-15.3%) of the overweight populations transitioned to obesity by age three, respectively. However, extrapolation to the 2010 U.S. population demonstrated that Mexican American males were the only population for whom net increases in obesity peaked during early childhood; age-specific net increases in obesity were approximately constant through the second decade of life for African Americans and Mexican American females and peaked at age 20 for Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: African American and Mexican American populations shoulder elevated rates of many obesity-associated chronic diseases and disparities in early transitions to obesity could further increase these inequalities if left unaddressed.",,,3,,,
1337,"The population burden of heart failure attributable to modifiable risk factors: the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to estimate the population burden of heart failure and the influence of modifiable risk factors. BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a common, costly, and fatal disorder, yet few studies have evaluated the population-level influence of modifiable risk factors. METHODS: From 14,709 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants, we estimated incidence rate differences (IRD) for the association between 5 modifiable risk factors (cigarette smoking, diabetes, elevated low-density lipoproteins, hypertension, and obesity) and heart failure. Potential impact fractions were used to measure expected changes in the heart failure incidence assuming achievement of a 5% proportional decrement in the prevalence of each risk factor. RESULTS: Over an average of 17.6 years of follow-up, 1 in 3 African American and 1 in 4 Caucasian participants were hospitalized with heart failure, defined as the first hospitalization with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision discharge codes of 428.x. Of the 5 modifiable risk factors, the largest IRD was observed for diabetes, which was associated with 1,058 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 787 to 1,329) and 660 (95% CI: 514 to 805) incident hospitalizations of heart failure/100,000 person-years among African-American and Caucasian participants, respectively. A 5% proportional reduction in the prevalence of diabetes would result in approximately 53 and 33 fewer incident heart failure hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years in African-American and Caucasian ARIC participants, respectively. When applied to U.S. populations, this reduction may prevent approximately 30,000 incident cases of heart failure annually. CONCLUSIONS: Modest decrements in the prevalence of modifiable heart failure risk factors such as diabetes may substantially decrease the incidence of this major disease.

1338,"Long-term association between self-reported signs and symptoms and heart failure hospitalizations: the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) Study AIMS: Although studies of the accuracy of heart failure (HF) classification scoring systems are available, few have examined their performance when restricted to self-reported items. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the association between a simplified version of the Gothenburg score, a validated HF score comprised of cardiac and pulmonary signs and symptoms and medication use, and incident HF hospitalizations in 15,430 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants. Gothenburg scores (range: 0-3) were constructed using self-reported items obtained at study baseline (1987-89). Incident HF hospitalization over 14.7 years of follow-up was defined as the first identified hospitalization with an ICD-9 discharge code of 428 (n = 1,668). Self-reported Gothenburg scores demonstrated very high agreement with the original metric comprised of self-reported and clinical measures and were directly associated with incident HF hospitalizations: [score = 1: hazard rate ratio (HRR) = 1.23 (1.07-1.42); score = 2: HRR = 2.17 (1.92-2.43); score = 3: HRR = 3.98 (3.37-4.70)]. CONCLUSION: In a population-based cohort, self-reported Gothenburg criteria items were associated with hospitalized HF over a prolonged follow-up time. The association was also consistent across groups defined by sex and race, suggesting that this simple score deserves further study as a screening tool for the identification of individuals at high risk of HF in resource-limited settings.",,,9,,,
1339,"Fine-mapping and initial characterization of QT interval loci in African Americans The QT interval (QT) is heritable and its prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. Most genetic studies of QT have examined European ancestral populations; however, the increased genetic diversity in African Americans provides opportunities to narrow association signals and identify population-specific variants. We therefore evaluated 6,670 SNPs spanning eleven previously identified QT loci in 8,644 African American participants from two Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) studies: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trial. Of the fifteen known independent QT variants at the eleven previously identified loci, six were significantly associated with QT in African American populations (P_1.20_10(-4)): ATP1B1, PLN1, KCNQ1, NDRG4, and two NOS1AP independent signals. We also identified three population-specific signals significantly associated with QT in African Americans (P_1.37_10(-5)): one at NOS1AP and two at ATP1B1. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in African Americans assisted in narrowing the region likely to contain the functional variants for several loci. For example, African American LD patterns showed that 0 SNPs were in LD with NOS1AP signal rs12143842, compared with European LD patterns that indicated 87 SNPs, which spanned 114.2 Kb, were in LD with rs12143842. Finally, bioinformatic-based characterization of the nine African American signals pointed to functional candidates located exclusively within non-coding regions, including predicted binding sites for transcription factors such as TBX5, which has been implicated in cardiac structure and conductance. In this detailed evaluation of QT loci, we identified several African Americans SNPs that better define the association with QT and successfully narrowed intervals surrounding established loci. These results demonstrate that the same loci influence variation in QT across multiple populations, that novel signals exist in African Americans, and that the SNPs identified as strong candidates for functional evaluation implicate gene regulatory dysfunction in QT prolongation.",,,8,,,
1340,"Drug-gene interactions and the search for missing heritability: a cross-sectional pharmacogenomics study of the QT interval Variability in response to drug use is common and heritable, suggesting that genome-wide pharmacogenomics studies may help explain the 'missing heritability' of complex traits. Here, we describe four independent analyses in 33_781 participants of European ancestry from 10 cohorts that were designed to identify genetic variants modifying the effects of drugs on QT interval duration (QT). Each analysis cross-sectionally examined four therapeutic classes: thiazide diuretics (prevalence of use=13.0%), tri/tetracyclic antidepressants (2.6%), sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents (2.9%) and QT-prolonging drugs as classified by the University of Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (4.4%). Drug-gene interactions were estimated using covariable-adjusted linear regression and results were combined with fixed-effects meta-analysis. Although drug-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions were biologically plausible and variables were well-measured, findings from the four cross-sectional meta-analyses were null (Pinteraction>5.0 _ 10(-8)). Simulations suggested that additional efforts, including longitudinal modeling to increase statistical power, are likely needed to identify potentially important pharmacogenomic effects.",,,8,,,
1341,"Fine mapping of QT interval regions in global populations refines previously identified QT interval loci and identifies signals unique to African and Hispanic descent populations BACKGROUND: The electrocardiographically measured QT interval (QT) is heritable and its prolongation is an established risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. Yet, most QT genetic studies have been performed in European ancestral populations, possibly reducing their global relevance. OBJECTIVE: To leverage diversity and improve biological insight, we fine mapped 16 of the 35 previously identified QT loci (46%) in populations of African American (n = 12,410) and Hispanic/Latino (n = 14,837) ancestry. METHODS: Racial/ethnic-specific multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for heart rate and clinical covariates were examined separately and in combination after inverse-variance weighted trans-ethnic meta-analysis. RESULTS: The 16 fine-mapped QT loci included on the Illumina Metabochip represented 21 independent signals, of which 16 (76%) were significantly (P-value_9.1_10-5) associated with QT. Through sequential conditional analysis we also identified three trans-ethnic novel SNPs at ATP1B1, SCN5A-SCN10A, and KCNQ1 and three Hispanic/Latino-specific novel SNPs at NOS1AP and SCN5A-SCN10A (two novel SNPs) with evidence of associations with QT independent of previous identified GWAS lead SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium patterns helped to narrow the region likely to contain the functional variants at several loci, including NOS1AP, USP50-TRPM7, and PRKCA, although intervals surrounding SLC35F1-PLN and CNOT1 remained broad in size (>100 kb). Finally, bioinformatics-based functional characterization suggested a regulatory function in cardiac tissues for the majority of independent signals that generalized and the novel SNPs. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a majority of identified SNPs implicate gene regulatory dysfunction in QT prolongation, that the same loci influence variation in QT across global populations, and that additional, novel, population-specific QT signals exist.

1342,"Differences in Hemoglobin A1c Between Hispanics/Latinos and Non-Hispanic Whites: An Analysis of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos and the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey OBJECTIVE: To determine whether, after adjustment for glycemia and other selected covariates, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) differed among adults from six Hispanic/Latino heritage groups (Central American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and South American) and between Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic white adults without self-reported diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from 13,083 individuals without self-reported diabetes from six Hispanic/Latino heritage groups, enrolled from 2008 to 2011 in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, and 2,242 non-Hispanic white adults enrolled during the 2007-2012 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We compared HbA1c levels among Hispanics/Latinos and between Hispanics/Latinos and non-Hispanic whites before and after adjustment for age, sex, fasting (FPG) and 2-h post-oral glucose tolerance test (2hPG) glucose, anthropometric measurements, and selected biochemical and hematologic variables and after stratification by diabetes status: unrecognized diabetes (FPG _7.1 mmol/L or 2hPG _11.2 mmol/L), prediabetes (FPG 5.6-7.0 mmol/L or 2hPG 7.8-11.1 mmol/L), and normal glucose tolerance (FPG < 5.6 mmol/L and 2hPG < 7.8 mmol/L). RESULTS: Adjusted mean HbA1c differed significantly across all seven groups (P < 0.001). Non-Hispanic whites had significantly lower HbA1c (P < 0.05) than each individual Hispanic/Latino heritage group. Upon stratification by diabetes status, statistically significant differences (P < 0.001) in adjusted mean HbA1c persisted across all seven groups. CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c differs among Hispanics/Latinos of diverse heritage groups and between non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics/Latinos after adjustment for glycemia and other covariates. The clinical significance of these differences is unknown. _ 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

1343,"Detecting prediabetes among Hispanics/Latinos from diverse heritage groups: Does the test matter? Findings from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos The objectives of this analysis were to compare the ability of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post oral load plasma glucose (2hPG), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to identify U.S. Hispanic/Latino individuals with prediabetes, and to assess its cardiovascular risk factor correlates. This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from 15,507 adults without self-reported diabetes mellitus from six Hispanic/Latino heritage groups, enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, which takes place in four U.S. communities. The prevalence of prediabetes was determined according to individual or combinations of ADA-defined cut points: FPG=5.6-7.0mmol/L, 2hPG=7.8-11.1mmol/L, and HbA1c=5.7%-6.4% (39-46mmol/mol). The sensitivity of these criteria to detect prediabetes was estimated. The prevalence ratios (PRs) for selected cardiovascular risk factors were compared among alternative categories of prediabetes versus normoglycemia [FPG< 5.6mmol/L and 2hPG< 7.8mmol/L and HbA1c< 5.7% (39mmol/mol)]. Approximately 36% of individuals met any of the ADA prediabetes criteria. Using 2hPG as the gold standard, the sensitivity of FPG was 40.1%, HbA1c was 45.6%, and that of HbA1c+FPG was 62.2%. The number of significant PRs for cardiovascular risk factors was higher among individuals with isolated 2hPG=7.8-11.1mmol/L, FPG=5.6-7.0mmol/L+HbA1c=5.7%-6.4%, or those who met the three prediabetes criteria. Assessing FPG, HbA1c, and cardiovascular risk factors in Hispanics/Latinos at risk might enhance the early prevention of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular complications in this young and growing population, independent of their heritage group.

1344,"Identifying probable diabetes mellitus among hispanics/latinos from four u.s. cities: findings from the hispanic community health study/study of latinos OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the ability of American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria to identify U.S. Hispanics/Latinos from diverse heritage groups with probable diabetes mellitus and assess cardiovascular risk factor correlates of those criteria. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data from 15,507 adults from 6 Hispanic/Latino heritage groups, enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. The prevalence of probable diabetes mellitus was estimated using individual or combinations of ADA-defined cut points. The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria at identifying diabetes mellitus from ADA-defined prediabetes and normoglycemia were evaluated. Prevalence ratios of hypertension, abnormal lipids, and elevated urinary albumin-creatinine ratio for unrecognized diabetes mellitus-versus prediabetes and normoglycemia-were calculated. RESULTS: Among Hispanics/Latinos (mean age, 43 years) with diabetes mellitus, 39.4% met laboratory test criteria for probable diabetes, and the prevalence varied by heritage group. Using the oral glucose tolerance test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c-alone or in combination-was low (18, 23, and 33%, respectively) at identifying probable diabetes mellitus. Individuals who met any criterion for probable diabetes mellitus had significantly higher (P< .05) prevalence of most cardiovascular risk factors than those with normoglycemia or prediabetes, and this association was not modified by Hispanic/Latino heritage group. CONCLUSION: FPG and hemoglobin A1c are not sensitive (but are highly specific) at detecting probable diabetes mellitus among Hispanics/Latinos, independent of heritage group. Assessing cardiovascular risk factors at diagnosis might prompt multitarget interventions and reduce health complications in this young population.

1345,"Setting realistic health goals: antecedents and consequences BACKGROUND: People often fail to translate their intentions into health behaviors. PURPOSE: The present research examined a new potential moderator of intention-behavior relations, namely, how realistic or unrealistic are respective goal intentions. Goal realism was defined as the degree to which intentions are aligned with expectations (i.e., predicted performance). METHODS: A validation study (N = 81) examined our novel goal realism measure. Study 1 (N = 246) tested goal importance, fantasy proneness, and pathways thinking as predictors of realistic goal setting using a cross-sectional questionnaire design. Moderation of the intention-behavior relation was tested in prospective surveys of cervical cancer screening (Study 2, N = 854), physical activity (Study 3, N = 237), and performance of a suite of 15 health behaviors (Study 4, N = 378). RESULTS: The validation study offered preliminary evidence concerning the convergent and predictive validity of the goal realism measure. Study 1 showed that goal importance, fantasy proneness, and pathways thinking interacted to predict how realistic were intentions to perform 11 health behaviors. In Study 2, realistic intentions better predicted women's attendance for cervical cancer screening compared with unrealistic intentions. Study 3 confirmed this finding for a frequently performed behavior (physical activity). In Study 4, multilevel modeling of longitudinal data for 15 health behaviors again revealed a significant goal realism _ intention interaction. Greater realism was associated with improved prediction of behavior by intention. The interaction term remained significant even when past behavior, perceived behavioral control, and other predictors were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings offer new insights into the factors that lead to more realistic intentions and demonstrate that goal realism influences how effectively intentions are translated into action. _ Society of Behavioral Medicine 2019.

1346,"Sustaining attendance at a mental health service: A randomized controlled trial OBJECTIVE: A substantial proportion of psychotherapeutic treatments are prematurely terminated because the client discontinues attendance. Interventions have been developed to reduce premature termination, but these are only moderately effective and often place considerable burden on clients and services. This research evaluated a brief, low-cost self-regulation intervention (i.e., implementation intentions) designed to sustain attendance at a group psychoeducation program. METHOD: Clients (N = 82) who had been referred for a psychological intervention due to anxiety or depression were sent a questionnaire concerning their views of attendance. Participants were randomly assigned to form an implementation intention as part of the questionnaire or not (controls). Attendance was then monitored over the 5 scheduled sessions of an evidence-based psychoeducational intervention. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that forming implementation intentions led to attendance at a greater number of sessions (M = 2.84 vs. 1.62), p < .01, and higher rates of completing the full course of treatment compared to controls (35% vs. 11%), p < .02. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention rooted in basic research on the psychology of action increased and sustained attendance at a mental health service.

1347,"Efficacy of a store-based environmental change intervention compared with a delayed treatment control condition on store customers' intake of fruits and vegetables OBJECTIVE: The present store-based intervention was designed to promote sales of fruits and vegetables (F&V) to increase intake among store customers--specifically customers of tiendas, small-to-medium-sized Latino food stores. DESIGN: Four tiendas were randomized to a 2-month environmental change intervention or a delayed treatment control condition. Employees and managers were trained to promote F&V sales, including how to implement a food marketing campaign and installing store equipment to promote fresh fruits and vegetables. The primary outcome was self-reported daily intake of F&V among a convenience sample of customers (at least forty per store) collected at baseline prior to randomization and then 4 months later. In addition, changes in availability of F&V in the tiendas, using unobtrusive observational methods, provided evidence of intervention fidelity. SETTING: Tiendas in central North Carolina. SUBJECTS: Participants included 179 customers who were recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America. RESULTS: A group-by-time interaction approached significance on daily servings of F&V; intervention customers reported an increase in F&V intake over time and as a function of the intervention (P < or = 0.06). Unexpectedly, self-efficacy for consuming more fruits (P < or = 0.01) and more vegetables (P < or = 0.06) decreased. In our store-level analyses, a group-by-time interaction was observed for availability of fresh and canned vegetables; the intervention increased availability of vegetables but not fruit. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental change strategies to promote healthy eating are needed given the rates of obesity and diabetes in the Latino population. A store-based intervention was moderately effective at increasing customers_ reported F&V intake. Such strategies can have a public health impact on underserved populations.",,,4,,,
1348,"A store-based intervention to increase fruit and vegetable consumption: The El Valor de Nuestra Salud cluster randomized controlled trial INTRODUCTION: Most evidence-based interventions to improve fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption target individual behaviors and family systems; however, these changes are difficult to sustain without environmental support. This paper describes an innovative social and structural food store-based intervention to increase availability and accessibility of FVs in tiendas (small- to medium-sized Latino food stores) and purchasing and consumption of FVs among tienda customers.METHODS: Using a cluster randomized controlled trial with 16 tiendas pair-matched and randomized to an intervention or wait-list control condition, this study will evaluate a 2-month intervention directed at tiendas, managers, and employees followed by a 4-month customer-directed food marketing campaign. The intervention involves social (e.g., employee trainings) and structural (e.g., infrastructure) environmental changes. Three hundred sixty-nine customers (approximately 23 per tienda) serve on an evaluation cohort and complete assessments (interviews and measurements of weight) at 3 time points: baseline, 6-months post-baseline, and 12-months post-baseline. The primary study outcome is customer-reported daily consumption of FVs. Manager interviews and monthly tienda audits and collection of sales data will provide evidence of tienda-level intervention effects, our secondary outcomes. Process evaluation methods assess dose delivered, dose received, and fidelity.RESULTS: Recruitment of tiendas, managers, employees, and customers is complete. Demographic data shows that 30% of the customers are males, thus providing a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a tienda-based intervention on Latino men.CONCLUSIONS: Determining whether a tienda-based intervention can improve customers' FV purchasing and consumption will provide key evidence for how to create healthier consumer food environments.Copyright _ 2015 Elsevier Inc.

1349,"Who is behind the stocking of energy-dense foods and beverages in small stores? The importance of food and beverage distributors OBJECTIVE: The present study examined food and beverage distributors' sourcing, placement and promotion of obesogenic (energy-dense, nutrient-poor) product categories from the perspective of small food store owners/managers. The obesogenic product categories of interest were savoury snacks, sugary beverages, sweet snacks, confectionery and frozen treats. Specifically, we examined how frequently distributors sourced these products, and the types of agreements and expectations they had for their placement and promotion. Differences were explored by store size and ethnicity. Fresh produce was used as a comparison when examining differences in frequency of sourcing only, with implications for healthy food access. DESIGN: Survey research involving in-person interviews. SETTING: Four urban areas in the USA: Baltimore, MD; Durham, NC; Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN; and San Diego, CA. SUBJECTS: Seventy-two small food store owners/managers, 65 % consent rate. RESULTS: Most distributors sourced obesogenic products weekly. Agreements to place products were predominantly informal (e.g. handshake) with sweet snack, confectionery and frozen treat distributors, and formal (e.g. contract) with savoury snack and sugary beverage distributors. Free-standing displays were the most common incentive provided by distributors and they expected some control over their placement and pricing. Free/discounted products and signage were also common incentives but slotting fees were not. Smaller stores and ethnic stores were less likely to receive various incentives, but among sweet snack distributors, they were more likely to control the price in ethnic v. non-ethnic stores. CONCLUSIONS: Obesogenic products are ubiquitous. Influencing what is made available to consumers in the retail food environment needs to consider the distributor.",,,7,,,
1350,"Drug-Resistance and Population Structure of Plasmodium falciparum Across the Democratic Republic of Congo Using High-Throughput Molecular Inversion Probes A better understanding of the drivers of the spread of malaria parasites and drug resistance across space and time is needed. These drivers can be elucidated using genetic tools. Here, a novel molecular inversion probe (MIP) panel targeting all major drug-resistance mutations and a set of microsatellites was used to genotype Plasmodium falciparum infections of 552 children from the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Microsatellite-based analysis of population structure suggests that parasites within the DRC form a homogeneous population. In contrast, sulfadoxine-resistance markers in dihydropteroate synthase show marked spatial structure with ongoing spread of double and triple mutants compared with 2007. These findings suggest that parasites in the DRC remain panmictic despite rapidly spreading antimalarial-resistance mutations. Moreover, highly multiplexed targeted sequencing using MIPs emerges as a cost-effective method for elucidating pathogen genetics in complex infections in large cohorts.",,,1,,,
1351,"Digital detection for tobacco control: online reactions to the 2009 U.S. cigarette excise tax increase INTRODUCTION: The Internet is revolutionizing tobacco control, but few have harnessed the Web for surveillance. We demonstrate for the first time an approach for analyzing aggregate Internet search queries that captures precise changes in population considerations about tobacco. METHODS: We compared tobacco-related Google queries originating in the United States during the week of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) 2009 cigarette excise tax increase with a historic baseline. Specific queries were then ranked according to their relative increases while also considering approximations of changes in absolute search volume. RESULTS: Individual queries with the largest relative increases the week of the SCHIP tax were ""cigarettes Indian reservations"" 640% (95% CI, 472-918), ""free cigarettes online"" 557% (95% CI, 432-756), and ""Indian reservations cigarettes"" 542% (95% CI, 414-733), amounting to about 7,500 excess searches. By themes, the largest relative increases were tribal cigarettes 246% (95% CI, 228-265), ""free"" cigarettes 215% (95% CI, 191-242), and cigarette stores 176% (95% CI, 160-193), accounting for 21,000, 27,000, and 90,000 excess queries. All avoidance queries, including those aforementioned themes, relatively increased 150% (95% CI, 144-155) or 550,000 from their baseline. All cessation queries increased 46% (95% CI, 44-48), or 175,000, around SCHIP; including themes for ""cold turkey"" 19% (95% CI, 11-27) or 2,600, cessation products 47% (95% CI, 44-50) or 78,000, and dubious cessation approaches (e.g., hypnosis) 40% (95% CI, 33-47) or 2,300. CONCLUSIONS: The SCHIP tax motivated specific changes in population considerations. Our strategy can support evaluations that temporally link tobacco control measures with instantaneous population reactions, as well as serve as a springboard for traditional studies, for example, including survey questionnaire design.",,,5,,,
1352,"Melanocortin 4 receptor pathway dysfunction in obesity: patient stratification aimed at MC4R agonist treatment Context: The hypothalamic melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) pathway serves a critical role in regulating body weight. Loss of function (LoF) mutations in the MC4R pathway, including mutations in the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), prohormone convertase 1 (PCSK1), leptin receptor (LEPR), or MC4R genes, have been shown to cause early-onset severe obesity. Methods: Through a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of known and predicted LoF variants in the POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR genes, we sought to estimate the number of US individuals with biallelic MC4R pathway LoF variants. Results: We predict ~650 _-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)/POMC, 8500 PCSK1, and 3600 LEPR homozygous and compound heterozygous individuals in the United States, cumulatively enumerating >12,800 MC4R pathway-deficient obese patients. Few of these variants have been genetically diagnosed to date. These estimates increase when we include a small subset of less rare variants: _-MSH/POMC,PCSK1 N221D, and a PCSK1 LoF variant (T640A). To further define the MC4R pathway and its potential impact on obesity, we tested associations between body mass index (BMI) and LoF mutation burden in the POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR genes in various populations. We show that the cumulative allele burden in individuals with two or more LoF alleles in one or more genes in the MC4R pathway are predisposed to a higher BMI than noncarriers or heterozygous LoF carriers with a defect in only one gene. Conclusions: Our analysis represents a genetically rationalized study of the hypothalamic MC4R pathway aimed at genetic patient stratification to determine which obese subpopulations should be studied to elucidate MC4R agonist (e.g., setmelanotide) treatment responsiveness.",,,8,,,
1353,"Genetic analysis of complex traits in the emerging Collaborative Cross The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a mouse recombinant inbred strain panel that is being developed as a resource for mammalian systems genetics. Here we describe an experiment that uses partially inbred CC lines to evaluate the genetic properties and utility of this emerging resource. Genome-wide analysis of the incipient strains reveals high genetic diversity, balanced allele frequencies, and dense, evenly distributed recombination sites-all ideal qualities for a systems genetics resource. We map discrete, complex, and biomolecular traits and contrast two quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approaches. Analysis based on inferred haplotypes improves power, reduces false discovery, and provides information to identify and prioritize candidate genes that is unique to multifounder crosses like the CC. The number of expression QTLs discovered here exceeds all previous efforts at eQTL mapping in mice, and we map local eQTL at 1-Mb resolution. We demonstrate that the genetic diversity of the CC, which derives from random mixing of eight founder strains, results in high phenotypic diversity and enhances our ability to map causative loci underlying complex disease-related traits.",,,1,,,
1354,"Measuring physical activity in outdoor community recreational environments: implications for research, policy, and practice Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) are major contributors to escalating health care costs in the USA. Physical activity is an important protective factor against CVD, and the National Prevention Strategy recognizes active living (defined as a way of life that integrates physical activity into everyday routines) as a priority for improving the nation's health. This paper focuses on developing more inclusive measures of physical activity in outdoor community recreational environments, specifically parks and trails, to enhance their usability for at-risk populations such as persons with mobility limitations. We develop an integrated conceptual framework for measuring physical activity in outdoor community recreational environments, describe examples of evidence-based tools for measuring physical activity in these settings, and discuss strategies to improve measurement of physical activity for persons with mobility limitations. Addressing these measurement issues is critically important to making progress towards national CVD goals pertaining to active community environments.",,,9,,,

In North Carolina, pedestrian/bicycle plans are becoming more prevalent. However, no studies have examined the spatial and temporal diffusion of pedestrian/bicycle plans. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed (a) temporal trends associated with municipal pedestrian/bicycle planning from 1974 to 2011 and (b) spatial patterns associated with municipal plans, specifically, whether the publication of a pedestrian/bicycle plan in a given year was associated with the number of neighboring municipalities with plans. SETTING: North Carolina from 1974 to 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was date of publication of all North Carolina municipal pedestrian and bicycle plans (1974-2011). We calculated Euclidean distances from each municipality center to all other municipality centers to derive whether municipalities were within 20 and 50 miles of each other. Sociodemographic covariates (eg, education, grant funding status, poverty, urbanicity, racial composition, population size, population growth) were collected from the US Census of Population (1980-2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010). Time series models fitted by generalized estimating equations were used to assess relationships between plan presence and the temporal and spatial predictor variables. RESULTS: The number of pedestrian and bicycle plans significantly increased over time, especially after 2006 when a state grant funding program was initiated. Unadjusted models indicated that municipalities were significantly more likely to have a pedestrian plan if higher numbers of neighboring municipalities had pedestrian plans. After adjustment for sociodemographic covariates and funding source, this relationship was attenuated but remained statistically significant. For bicycle plans, no significant associations were observed between plan presence and the number of neighboring municipalities with bicycle plans in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study can be used to generate hypotheses to test theories about diffusion of innovation and social contagion processes in pedestrian/bicycle planning.",,,2,,,
1356,"Pedestrian and bicycle planning in rural communities: tools for active living Pedestrian and bicycle planning has traditionally been viewed from an urban design perspective, rather than a rural or regional planning perspective. This study examined the prevalence and quality of pedestrian and bicycle plans in North Carolina according to geography, regional planning, and sociodemographics. Plan prevalence was lower, but plan quality tended to be higher, in rural areas compared with urban areas. Correlations between plan prevalence and active commuting were strongest in lower-income rural areas. By engaging in the planning process, rural residents and other stakeholders can support active living.",,,2,,,

1358,"Factors affecting the achievement of fertility intentions in urban Nigeria: analysis of longitudinal data BACKGROUND: Maternal mortality ratio in Nigeria is among the highest in the world with an estimated 160 women dying every day of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. In addition to appropriate management of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, preventing unwanted pregnancies is an effective way to reduce maternal deaths. Identifying potentially modifiable factors associated with the achievement of fertility intentions is critical for developing behavior change interventions that will contribute to reducing maternal mortality. METHODS: The data analyzed came from a longitudinal design with data collected in 2010/2011 and 2014 from the same group of women of reproductive age in six Nigerian cities. The data were collected as part of efforts to evaluate the effects of the Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI). A total of 10,672 women were interviewed at the two points in time but the analyses in this manuscript were limited to 1921 in-union women who reported that they desired no more children at baseline in 2010/2011. The principal analytic method was multivariable regression adjusted for clustering at the enumeration area level. The analysis controlled for socio-demographic and household variables, ideational characteristics, and contraceptive use at baseline. RESULTS: About two thirds of the women who desired no more children at baseline have neither had any children nor were pregnant at endline. The strongest predictors of the achievement of fertility intentions include parity, age, religion, residence, spousal communication about family size, perceived severity of another pregnancy, and spousal agreement about family size. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive strategy to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies should include efforts to increase women's understanding about effective ways to prevent unplanned pregnancies and strengthen self-efficacy for contraceptive use. Promoting spousal communication about reproductive issues, engaging men, promoting smaller family sizes and changing pronatalist attitudes should also be part of such a strategy.",,,6,,,

1360,"Predictors of response to insulin therapy in youth with poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes in the TODAY trial OBJECTIVE: To understand the factors associated with glycemic control after starting insulin in youth with type 2 diabetes following glycemic failure (persistent HbA1c _8%) with metformin alone, metformin_+__osiglitazone or metformin_+__ifestyle in the TODAY study. METHODS: Change in HbA1c after add-on insulin therapy and the factors predictive of glycemic response were evaluated. At 1-year postinsulin initiation, 253 youth had a mean of 3.9___1.0 visits since the time of insulin initiation. Participants were divided into three groups according to glycemic control: consistent decrease in HbA1c by _0.5%, change < 0.5%, or consistent increase in HbA1c _0.5%, at 75% or more of the visits. RESULTS: Within 1-year postinsulin initiation, 33.2% of participants had a consistent HbA1c decrease of _0.5%, 46.2% changed HbA1c < 0.5%, and 20.6% had an increase _0.5%. At randomization into TODAY and at time of insulin initiation, the three glycemia groups were similar in age, sex, race-ethnicity, pubertal stage, BMI z-score, diabetes duration, and insulin secretion indices. Consistent HbA1c improvement was associated with higher insulin sensitivity (1/fasting insulin) at randomization and at time of failure, higher adiponectin at randomization, and was not associated with indices of _-cell function. CONCLUSIONS: Response to add-on insulin was highly variable among youth in TODAY. Greater insulin sensitivity and higher adiponectin concentrations at randomization were associated with improved glycemic control after initiation of insulin. Due to limited information on adherence to insulin injections, the roles of adherence to the prescribed insulin regimen or psychosocial factors are unknown. _ 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1361,"Protective role of interleukin-10 in ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying ozone (O_)-induced pulmonary inflammation remain unclear. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is known to inhibit inflammatory mediators. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying interleuken-10 (IL-10)-mediated attenuation of O_-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. METHODS: Il10-deficient (Il10(-/-)) and wild-type (Il10(+/+)) mice were exposed to 0.3 ppm O_ or filtered air for 24, 48, or 72 hr. Immediately after exposure, differential cell counts and total protein (a marker of lung permeability) were assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). mRNA and protein levels of cellular mediators were determined from lung homogenates. We also used global mRNA expression analyses of lung tissue with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify patterns of gene expression through which IL-10 modifies O_-induced inflammation. RESULTS: Mean numbers of BALF polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were significantly greater in Il10(-/-) mice than in Il10(+/+) mice after exposure to O_ at all time points tested. O_-enhanced nuclear NF-_B translocation was elevated in the lungs of Il10(-/-) compared with Il10(+/+) mice. Gene expression analyses revealed several IL-10-dependent and O_-dependent mediators, including macrophage inflammatory protein 2, cathepsin E, and serum amyloid A3. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that IL-10 protects against O_-induced pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation and cell proliferation. Moreover, gene expression analyses identified three response pathways and several genetic targets through which IL-10 may modulate the innate and adaptive immune response. These novel mechanisms of protection against the pathogenesis of O_-induced pulmonary inflammation may also provide potential therapeutic targets to protect susceptible individuals.",,,1,,,
1362,"Correlates of treatment patterns among youth with type 2 diabetes OBJECTIVE To describe treatment regimens in youth with type 2 diabetes and examine associations between regimens, demographic and clinical characteristics, and glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This report includes 474 youth with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who completed a SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study visit. Diabetes treatment regimen was categorized as lifestyle alone, metformin monotherapy, any oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) other than metformin or two or more OHAs, insulin monotherapy, and insulin plus any OHA(s). Association of treatment with demographic and clinical characteristics (fasting C-peptide [FCP], diabetes duration, and self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG]), and A1C was assessed by _(2) and ANOVA. Multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate independent associations of treatment regimens and A1C, adjusting for demographics, diabetes duration, FCP, and SMBG. RESULTS Over 50% of participants reported treatment with metformin alone or lifestyle. Of the autoantibody-negative youth, 40% were on metformin alone, while 33% were on insulin-containing regimens. Participants on metformin alone had a lower A1C (7.0 _ 2.0%, 53 _ 22 mmol/mol) than those on insulin alone (9.2 _ 2.7%, 77 _ 30 mmol/mol) or insulin plus OHA (8.6 _ 2.6%, 70 _ 28 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001). These differences remained significant after adjustment (7.5 _ 0.3%, 58 _ 3 mmol/mol; 9.1 _ 0.4%, 76 _ 4 mmol/mol; and 8.6 _ 0.4%, 70 _ 4 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001) and were more striking in those with diabetes for _2 years (7.9 _ 2.8, 9.9 _ 2.8, and 9.8 _ 2.6%). Over one-half of those on insulin-containing therapies still experience treatment failure (A1C _8%, 64 mmol/mol). CONCLUSIONS Approximately half of youth with type 2 diabetes were managed with lifestyle or metformin alone and had better glycemic control than individuals using other therapies. Those with longer diabetes duration in particular commonly experienced treatment failures, and more effective management strategies are needed.",,,4,,,
1363,"Danish Translation and Linguistic Validation of the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) CONTEXT: The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is the basis for standardized clinician-based grading and reporting of adverse events in cancer clinical trials. The U.S. National Cancer Institute has developed the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE) to incorporate patient self-reporting of symptomatic adverse events. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to translate and linguistically validate a Danish language version of PRO-CTCAE. METHODS: The U.S. English language PRO-CTCAE was translated into Danish using forward and backward procedures with reconciliation. The linguistic validity of the PRO-CTCAE Danish was examined in two successive rounds of semistructured cognitive interviews in a sample of 56 patients equally distributed by gender and cancer type (prostate, head and neck, lung, breast, gynecological, gastrointestinal, and hematological cancer), and who were currently undergoing cancer treatment. RESULTS: In the first round of linguistic validation (n_=_42), the phrasing of five symptomatic toxicities was adjusted, and the refined phrasing was retested in a second round of interviews (n_=_14). Agreement about phrasing that was both culturally acceptable and semantically comprehensible was achieved in the second round. Statements from participants describing the meaning of the PRO-CTCAE symptomatic toxicities support conceptual equivalence to the U.S. English language version. CONCLUSION: Availability of the NCI PRO-CTCAE in languages beyond English will support international congruence in self-reporting of side effects of cancer treatment. A rigorous methodology was used to develop the Danish language version of PRO-CTCAE. Results provide preliminary support for the use of PRO-CTCAE in cancer clinical trials that include Danish speakers. Copyright _ 2016 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

1365,"Risks of Lynch syndrome cancers for MSH6 mutation carriers BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in MSH6 account for 10%-20% of Lynch syndrome colorectal cancers caused by hereditary DNA mismatch repair gene mutations. Because there have been only a few studies of mutation carriers, their cancer risks are uncertain. METHODS: We identified 113 families of MSH6 mutation carriers from five countries that we ascertained through family cancer clinics and population-based cancer registries. Mutation status, sex, age, and histories of cancer, polypectomy, and hysterectomy were sought from 3104 of their relatives. Age-specific cumulative risks for carriers and hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer risks of carriers, compared with those of the general population of the same country, were estimated by use of a modified segregation analysis with appropriate conditioning depending on ascertainment. RESULTS: For MSH6 mutation carriers, the estimated cumulative risks to ages 70 and 80 years, respectively, were as follows: for colorectal cancer, 22% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14% to 32%) and 44% (95% CI = 28% to 62%) for men and 10% (95% CI = 5% to 17%) and 20% (95% CI = 11% to 35%) for women; for endometrial cancer, 26% (95% CI = 18% to 36%) and 44% (95% CI = 30% to 58%); and for any cancer associated with Lynch syndrome, 24% (95% CI = 16% to 37%) and 47% (95% CI = 32% to 66%) for men and 40% (95% CI = 32% to 52%) and 65% (95% CI = 53% to 78%) for women. Compared with incidence for the general population, MSH6 mutation carriers had an eightfold increased incidence of colorectal cancer (HR = 7.6, 95% CI = 5.4 to 10.8), which was independent of sex and age. Women who were MSH6 mutation carriers had a 26-fold increased incidence of endometrial cancer (HR = 25.5, 95% CI = 16.8 to 38.7) and a sixfold increased incidence of other cancers associated with Lynch syndrome (HR = 6.0, 95% CI = 3.4 to 10.7). CONCLUSION: We have obtained precise and accurate estimates of both absolute and relative cancer risks for MSH6 mutation carriers.",,,3,,,
1366,"Parental Self-Efficacy in New Mothers Predicts Infant Growth Trajectories The purpose of this study was to examine whether parental self-efficacy (PSE) is associated with change in infant weight-for-length z score (WLZ) from age 3 to 12 months. Data were drawn from the Infant Care, Feeding, and Risk of Obesity study, conducted with low-income, African American mother-infant dyads (n = 127). PSE was measured at infant age of 3 months. Infant anthropometrics were measured at infant age of 3 and 12 months, WLZ change between these time points was calculated, and infants stratified into WLZ change categories (expected, excessive, or slow). To analyze the data, ANCOVA, multiple regression, and post hoc techniques were used. Controlling for infant birthweight, PSE at 3 months was associated with infant WLZ change (_2 = 0.05, p = .04). Mothers of infants who exhibited excessive growth had higher PSE than mothers of infants who exhibited slow growth (Tukey-adjusted p = .03). This finding suggests that infants of mothers with high PSE may have increased obesity risk, but more research is needed.",,,3,,,
1367,"Blood pressure-associated polymorphism controls ARHGAP42 expression via serum response factor DNA binding We recently demonstrated that selective expression of the Rho GTPase-activating protein ARHGAP42 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) controls blood pressure by inhibiting RhoA-dependent contractility, providing a mechanism for the blood pressure-associated locus within the ARHGAP42 gene. The goals of the current study were to identify polymorphisms that affect ARHGAP42 expression and to better assess ARHGAP42's role in the development of hypertension. Using DNase I hypersensitivity methods and ENCODE data, we have identified a regulatory element encompassing the ARHGAP42 SNP rs604723 that exhibits strong SMC-selective, allele-specific activity. Importantly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of this element in cultured human SMCs markedly reduced endogenous ARHGAP42 expression. DNA binding and transcription assays demonstrated that the minor T allele variation at rs604723 increased the activity of this fragment by promoting serum response transcription factor binding to a cryptic cis-element. ARHGAP42 expression was increased by cell stretch and sphingosine 1-phosphate in a RhoA-dependent manner, and deletion of ARHGAP42 enhanced the progression of hypertension in mice treated with DOCA-salt. Our analysis of a well-characterized cohort of untreated borderline hypertensive patients suggested that ARHGAP42 genotype has important implications in regard to hypertension risk. Taken together, our data add insight into the genetic mechanisms that control blood pressure and provide a potential target for individualized antihypertensive therapies.",,,1,,,
1368,"""Organic,"" ""natural,"" and ""additive-free"" cigarettes: Comparing the effects of advertising claims and disclaimers on perceptions of harm Introduction: The U.S. Tobacco Control Act restricts advertising or labeling that suggests one tobacco product is less harmful than another. We sought to examine how ""organic,"" ""natural,"" and ""additive-free"" advertising claims and corresponding disclaimers affect perceptions of cigarettes' harm. Methods: Participants were a national probability sample of adults in the U.S. (n = 1,114, including 344 smokers). We conducted a 5 (claim) _ 2 (disclaimer) between-subjects factorial experiment. Participants viewed a Natural American Spirit cigarettes ad claiming they were ""organic,"" ""natural,"" ""additive-free,"" ""light,"" or ""regular;"" and with or without a corresponding disclaimer. The outcome was perceived harm of the advertised cigarettes. Among smokers, we also assessed interest in switching within their current brand to cigarettes with this characteristic (e.g., ""additive-free""). Results: Claims in the ad had a large effect on perceived harm (Cohen's d = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.47-1.29). Claims of cigarettes being ""organic,"" ""natural,"" or ""additive-free"" reduced perceived harm from the advertised cigarettes, as compared to ""regular"" and ""light"" claims. Disclaimers had a small effect, increasing perceived harm (d = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.08-0.41). The problematic claims also increased smokers' interest in switching. Disclaimers had no effect on smokers' interest in switching. Conclusions: ""Organic,"" ""natural,"" and ""additive-free"" claims may mislead people into thinking that the advertised cigarettes are less harmful than other cigarettes. Disclaimers did not offset misperceptions of harm created by false claims. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration should restrict the use of these misleading claims in tobacco advertising.",,,0,,,
1369,"UNC perceived message effectiveness: validation of a brief scale BACKGROUND: Interventionists commonly identify promising messages for health communication efforts based on audience members' ratings of perceived message effectiveness (PME). PURPOSE: We sought to validate a new PME measure that improved on existing scales by focusing on the behavior and respondent, being brief, and having strong psychometric properties. METHODS: Participants were a national convenience sample of 999 adults and national probability samples of 1,692 adults and 869 adolescents recruited in 2015. Smokers and nonsmokers rated up to six brief messages about the chemicals in cigarette smoke on two PME scales. The first was the new three-item University of North Carolina (UNC) PME Scale that assessed effects perceptions. The second was an established six-item PME scale that assessed message perceptions. We examined the UNC PME Scale's psychometric properties and compared both scales using item factor analysis. RESULTS: The UNC PME Scale measured the same construct across multiple chemical messages (all factor loadings _ 0.86). It exhibited high reliability (>0.85) over very low to moderate levels of PME (z = -2.5 to 0.2), a range that is useful for identifying more promising messages. Samples of adults and adolescents showed a similar pattern of results. As expected, the UNC PME Scale was strongly positively correlated with message perceptions (r = .84). It also exhibited strong psychometric properties among participants regardless of education, reactance, sex, and smoking status. DISCUSSION: The UNC PME Scale reliably and validly measured PME among adults and adolescents from diverse groups. This brief scale may be used to efficiently evaluate candidate antismoking messages and may be suitable for adaptation to other health risk behaviors. _ Society of Behavioral Medicine 2018.

1370,"Social identity and support for counteracting tobacco company marketing that targets vulnerable populations RATIONALE: Tobacco companies use advertising to target vulnerable populations, including youth, racial/ethnic minorities, and sexual minorities. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine how personal identity affects support for population-specific anti-smoking advertisements that could serve as countermeasures to industry marketing practices. METHODS: In 2014-2015, we surveyed probability phone samples of adults and adolescents (n_=_6,139) and an online convenience sample of adults (n_=_4,137) in the United States. We experimentally varied the description of tobacco industry marketing practices (no description, general, or specific to a target group). The four prevention target groups were teens; African Americans; Latinos; and gays, lesbians, and bisexuals (GLBs). Participants were either members or non-members of their prevention target group. RESULTS: Support was highest for anti-smoking advertisements targeting teens, moderate for Latinos and African Americans, and lowest for GLBs. In-group members expressed higher support than out-group members when anti-smoking advertisements targeted African Americans, Latinos, and GLBs (all p_< _0.05). However, when teens were the target prevention group, in-group members expressed lower support than out-group members (p_< _0.05). The description of industry marketing practices did not have an effect. Results were similar across the phone and online studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the public strongly supports advertisements to prevent smoking among teens, but support for similar efforts among other vulnerable populations is comparatively low. Anti-smoking campaigns for vulnerable populations may benefit from a greater understanding of the role of social identity in shaping public support for such campaigns. Copyright _ 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

DESIGN: Mixed methods. METHODS: Semistructured interviews and sorting of 12 a priori hypothesized drivers into categories of always, sometimes, and never influencing food choice. SETTING: Delhi, India. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight women aged 20-35 years selected from the roster of a prospective cohort study. PHENOMENON OF INTEREST: Drivers of food choice. ANALYSIS: Interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated, then analyzed using an iterative, constant comparative process. Differences in pile sort rankings across tertiles of body mass index and wealth index were tested using Fisher exact tests. RESULT: Four primary themes emerged: (1) family influence; (2) cultural perceptions, with 3 subthemes of beliefs relating to (a) outside food and less healthful food, (b) seasonality, and (c) hometown food; (3) convenience, with 3 subthemes of (a) decisions regarding procurement of food, (b) not having time to cook, resulting in eating out or purchasing premade foods, and (c) eating whatever is available at home or is left over from previous meals; and (4) habit, with 2 subthemes of (a) subconscious decisions and (b) food roots. Responses from the pile sort activity revealed perceptions that food safety and health most influence food choice whereas marketing and advertisements least influence it. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Young adult women in Delhi seem to rely on preferences of their families, habits and perceptions established in childhood, convenience, and food safety and health when making choices about food. These aspects of decision-making should be targeted in future interventions aimed at improving dietary intake in this population. Copyright _ 2018 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.

1373,"E. coli CB390: An alternative E. coli host for simultaneous detection of somatic and F+ coliphage viruses in reclaimed and other waters Somatic and F+ coliphages have been identified and validated as virus indicators of fecal contamination in ground water by US EPA and more recently they are being considered for use in managing both marine and fresh recreational water and wastewater discharges. Studies documenting their usefulness as viral indicator in reclaimed water sources in the USA are limited. However, simultaneous detection of both somatic and F+ coliphages on a single E. coli host is preferred over their separate analysis because both are abundant in wastewater, they may respond differently to wastewater reclamation treatment processes, and separate analysis for each group in separate host bacteria adds complexity and cost. In this study, a new total coliphage host (E. coli CB390, CECT9198) was evaluated for its ability to detect somatic, F+ coliphages, and total coliphages by US EPA Methods 1601 and 1602.

1374,"Use of massively parallel pyrosequencing to evaluate the diversity of and selection on Plasmodium falciparum csp T-cell epitopes in Lilongwe, Malawi The development of an effective malaria vaccine has been hampered by the genetic diversity of commonly used target antigens. This diversity has led to concerns about allele-specific immunity limiting the effectiveness of vaccines. Despite extensive genetic diversity of circumsporozoite protein (CS), the most successful malaria vaccine is RTS/S, a monovalent CS vaccine. By use of massively parallel pyrosequencing, we evaluated the diversity of CS haplotypes across the T-cell epitopes in parasites from Lilongwe, Malawi. We identified 57 unique parasite haplotypes from 100 participants. By use of ecological and molecular indexes of diversity, we saw no difference in the diversity of CS haplotypes between adults and children. We saw evidence of weak variant-specific selection within this region of CS, suggesting naturally acquired immunity does induce variant-specific selection on CS. Therefore, the impact of CS vaccines on variant frequencies with widespread implementation of vaccination requires further study.",,,1,,,

1378,"Arsenic-Associated Changes to the Epigenome: What Are the Functional Consequences? Inorganic arsenic (iAs) poses a major threat to worldwide human health, and yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxic effects associated with iAs exposure are not well understood. There is increasing experimental evidence indicating that epigenetic modifications may play a major role in the development of diseases associated with exposure to environmental toxicants. Research in the field has firmly established that iAs exposure is associated with epigenetic alterations including changes in DNA methylation, miRNA abundance, and post-translational histone modifications. Here, we summarize recent studies that have expanded the current knowledge of these relationships. These studies have pinpointed specific regions of the genome and genes that are targets of arsenical-induced epigenetic changes, including those associated with in utero iAs exposure. The recent literature indicates that iAs biotransformation likely plays an important role in the relationship between iAs exposure and the epigenome, in addition to the sex and genetic background of individuals. The research also shows that relatively low to moderate exposure to iAs is associated with epigenetic effects. However, while it is well established that arsenicals can alter components of the epigenome, in many cases, the biological significance of these alterations remains unknown. The manner by which these and future studies may help inform the role of epigenetic modifications in the development of iAs-associated disease is evaluated and the need for functional validation emphasized.",,,7,,,
1379,"Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early-Life Arsenic Exposure: Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in their drinking water. Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects, including those that are evident in adulthood. There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer. OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early-life iAs exposure. DISCUSSION: Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is mounting that relates early-life iAs exposure and cancer development later in life. Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early-life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease outcomes.",,,3,,,
1380,"Arsenic and the epigenome: interindividual differences in arsenic metabolism related to distinct patterns of DNA methylation Biotransformation of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is one of the factors that determines the character and magnitude of the diverse detrimental health effects associated with chronic iAs exposure, but it is unknown how iAs biotransformation may impact the epigenome. Here, we integrated analyses of genome-wide, gene-specific promoter DNA methylation levels of peripheral blood leukocytes with urinary arsenical concentrations of subjects from a region of Mexico with high levels of iAs in drinking water. These analyses revealed dramatic differences in DNA methylation profiles associated with concentrations of specific urinary metabolites of arsenic (As). The majority of individuals in this study had positive indicators of As-related disease, namely pre-diabetes mellitus or diabetes mellitus (DM). Methylation patterns of genes with known associations with DM were associated with urinary concentrations of specific iAs metabolites. Future studies will determine whether these DNA methylation profiles provide mechanistic insight into the development of iAs-associated disease, predict disease risk, and/or serve as biomarkers of iAs exposure in humans. _ 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,8,,,

We reviewed 6.5 million deliveries, surveyed in 15,411 facilities. Most of the data were extracted from reports and aggregated with excel. RESULTS: Hemorrhage and hypertensive diseases contributed to about one third of institutional maternal deaths and indirect causes contributed another third (given the overrepresentation of sub-Saharan African countries with large proportions of indirect causes). The most lethal obstetric complication, across all regions, was ruptured uterus, followed by sepsis in Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. Stillbirth rates exceeded pre-discharge neonatal death rates in nearly all countries, possibly because women and their newborns were discharged soon after birth. CONCLUSIONS: To a large extent, facility-based findings mirror what population-based systematic reviews have also documented. As coverage of a skilled attendant at birth increases, proportionally more deaths will occur in facilities, making improvements in record-keeping and health management information systems, especially for stillbirths and early neonatal deaths, all the more critical.",,,2,,,
1382,"Referral patterns through the lens of health facility readiness to manage obstetric complications: national facility-based results from Ghana INTRODUCTION: Countries with high maternal and newborn mortality can benefit from national facility level data that describe intra-facility emergency referral patterns for major obstetric complications. This paper assesses the relationship between referral and facilities' readiness to treat complications at each level of the health system in Ghana. We also investigate other facility characteristics associated with referral. METHODS: The National Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care Assessment 2010 provided aggregated information from 977 health facilities. Readiness was defined in a 2-step process: availability of a health worker who could provide life-saving interventions and a minimum package of drugs, supplies, and equipment to perform the interventions. The second step mapped interventions to major obstetric complications. We used descriptive statistics and simple linear regression. RESULTS: Lower level facilities were likely to refer nearly all women with complications. District hospitals resolved almost two-thirds of all complicated cases, referring 9%. The most prevalent indications for referral were prolonged/obstructed labor and antepartum hemorrhage. Readiness to treat a complication was correlated with a reduction in referral for all complications except uterine rupture. Facility readiness was low: roughly 40% of hospitals and 10% of lower level facilities met the readiness threshold. Facilities referred fewer women when they had higher caseloads, more midwives, better infrastructure, and systems of communication and transport. DISCUSSION: Understanding how deliveries and obstetric complications are distributed across the health system helps policy makers contextualize decisions about the pathways to providing maternity services. Improving conditions for referral (by increasing access to communication and transport systems) and the management of obstetric complications (increasing readiness) will enhance quality of care and make referral more effective and efficient.",,,2,,,
1383,"The triple threat of pregnancy, HIV infection and malaria: reported causes of maternal mortality in two nationwide health facility assessments in Mozambique, 2007 and 2012 BACKGROUND: The paper's primary purpose is to determine changes in magnitude and causes of institutional maternal mortality in Mozambique. We also describe shifts in the location of institutional deaths and changes in availability of prevention and treatment measures for malaria and HIV infection. METHODS: Two national cross-sectional assessments of health facilities with childbirth services were conducted in 2007 and 2012. Each collected retrospective data on deliveries and maternal deaths and their causes. In 2007, 2,199 cases of maternal deaths were documented over a 12 month period; in 2012, 459 cases were identified over a three month period. In 2007, data collection also included reviews of maternal deaths when records were available (n_=_712). RESULTS: Institutional maternal mortality declined from 541 to 284/100,000 births from 2007 to 2012. The rate of decline among women dying of direct causes was 66% compared to 26% among women dying of indirect causes. Cause-specific mortality ratios fell for all direct causes. Patterns among indirect causes were less conclusive given differences in cause-of-death recording. In absolute numbers, the combination of antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage was the leading direct cause of death each year and HIV and malaria the main non-obstetric causes. Based on maternal death reviews, evidence of HIV infection, malaria or anemia was found in more than 40% of maternal deaths due to abortion, ectopic pregnancy and sepsis. Almost half (49%) of all institutional maternal deaths took place in the largest hospitals in 2007 while in 2012, only 24% occurred in these hospitals. The availability of antiretrovirals and antimalarials increased in all types of facilities, but increases were most dramatic in health centers. CONCLUSIONS: The rate at which women died of direct causes in Mozambique's health facilities appears to have declined significantly. Despite a clear improvement in access to antiretrovirals and antimalarials, especially at lower levels of health care, malaria, HIV, and anemia continue to exact a heavy toll on child-bearing women. Going forward, efforts to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths must maximize the use of antenatal care that includes integrated preventive/treatment options for HIV infection, malaria and anemia.",,,2,,,
1384,"Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years - Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2014 PROBLEM/CONDITION: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). PERIOD COVERED: 2014. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance system that provides estimates of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 11 ADDM sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). ADDM surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by professional service providers in the community. Staff completing record review and abstraction receive extensive training and supervision and are evaluated according to strict reliability standards to certify effective initial training, identify ongoing training needs, and ensure adherence to the prescribed methodology. Record review and abstraction occurs in a variety of data sources ranging from general pediatric health clinics to specialized programs serving children with developmental disabilities. In addition, most of the ADDM sites also review records for children who have received special education services in public schools. In the second phase of the study, all abstracted information is reviewed systematically by experienced clinicians to determine ASD case status. A child is considered to meet the surveillance case definition for ASD if he or she displays behaviors, as described on one or more comprehensive evaluations completed by community-based professional providers, consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism); or Asperger disorder. This report provides updated ASD prevalence estimates for children aged 8 years during the 2014 surveillance year, on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria, and describes characteristics of the population of children with ASD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which made considerable changes to ASD diagnostic criteria. The change in ASD diagnostic criteria might influence ADDM ASD prevalence estimates; therefore, most (85%) of the records used to determine prevalence estimates based on DSM-IV-TR criteria underwent additional review under a newly operationalized surveillance case definition for ASD consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children meeting this new surveillance case definition could qualify on the basis of one or both of the following criteria, as documented in abstracted comprehensive evaluations: 1) behaviors consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic features; and/or 2) an ASD diagnosis, whether based on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Stratified comparisons of the number of children meeting either of these two case definitions also are reported. RESULTS: For 2014, the overall prevalence of ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59) children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates varied among sites, from 13.1-29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Males were four times more likely than females to be identified with ASD. Prevalence estimates were higher for non-Hispanic white (henceforth, white) children compared with non-Hispanic black (henceforth, black) children, and both groups were more likely to be identified with ASD compared with Hispanic children. Among the nine sites with sufficient data on intellectual ability, 31% of children with ASD were classified in the range of intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ] < 70), 25% were in the borderline range (IQ 71-85), and 44% had IQ scores in the average to above average range (i.e., IQ >85). The distribution of intellectual ability varied by sex and race/ethnici y. Although mention of developmental concerns by age 36 months was documented for 85% of children with ASD, only 42% had a comprehensive evaluation on record by age 36 months. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 52 months and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity. For the targeted comparison of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 results, the number and characteristics of children meeting the newly operationalized DSM-5 case definition for ASD were similar to those meeting the DSM-IV-TR case definition, with DSM-IV-TR case counts exceeding DSM-5 counts by less than 5% and approximately 86% overlap between the two case definitions (kappa = 0.85). INTERPRETATION: Findings from the ADDM Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites, provide updated population-based estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple communities in the United States. The overall ASD prevalence estimate of 16.8 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in 2014 is higher than previously reported estimates from the ADDM Network. Because the ADDM sites do not provide a representative sample of the entire United States, the combined prevalence estimates presented in this report cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the United States. Consistent with reports from previous ADDM surveillance years, findings from 2014 were marked by variation in ASD prevalence when stratified by geographic area, sex, and level of intellectual ability. Differences in prevalence estimates between black and white children have diminished in most sites, but remained notable for Hispanic children. For 2014, results from application of the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 case definitions were similar, overall and when stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subtype, or level of intellectual ability. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Beginning with surveillance year 2016, the DSM-5 case definition will serve as the basis for ADDM estimates of ASD prevalence in future surveillance reports. Although the DSM-IV-TR case definition will eventually be phased out, it will be applied in a limited geographic area to offer additional data for comparison. Future analyses will examine trends in the continued use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, such as autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger disorder in health and education records, documentation of symptoms consistent with DSM-5 terminology, and how these trends might influence estimates of ASD prevalence over time. The latest findings from the ADDM Network provide evidence that the prevalence of ASD is higher than previously reported estimates and continues to vary among certain racial/ethnic groups and communities. With prevalence of ASD ranging from 13.1 to 29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in different communities throughout the United States, the need for behavioral, educational, residential, and occupational services remains high, as does the need for increased research on both genetic and nongenetic risk factors for ASD.",,,1,,,
1385,"A nested case-control study of midgestation vitamin D deficiency and risk of severe preeclampsia CONTEXT: Vitamin D may be important in the pathogenesis of severe preeclampsia. Given the few effective preventive strategies for severe preeclampsia, studies establishing this link are needed so that effective interventions can be developed. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess whether midgestation vitamin D deficiency is associated with development of severe preeclampsia. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a nested case-control study of pregnant women who had previously given blood for routine genetic multiple marker screening and subsequently delivered at a tertiary hospital between January 2004 and November 2008. PATIENTS: Participants included women with singleton pregnancies in the absence of any chronic medical illnesses. From an overall cohort of 3992 women, 51 cases of severe preeclampsia were matched by race/ethnicity with 204 women delivering at term with uncomplicated pregnancies. Banked maternal serum was used to measure maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome was severe preeclampsia. RESULTS: Midgestation maternal 25(OH)D concentration was lower in women who subsequently developed severe preeclampsia compared with controls [median (interquartile range), 75 (47-107) nmol/liter vs. 98 (68-113) nmol/liter; P = 0.01]. Midgestation maternal 25(OH)D of less than 50 nmol/liter was associated with an almost 4-fold odds of severe preeclampsia (unadjusted odds ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-8.65) compared with midgestation levels of at least 75 nmol/liter. Adjustment for known confounders strengthened the observed association (adjusted odds ratio, 5.41; 95% confidence interval, 2.02-14.52). CONCLUSION: Maternal midgestation vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased risk of severe preeclampsia. Vitamin D deficiency may be a modifiable risk factor for severe preeclampsia.",,,3,,,

1388,"First-trimester maternal vitamin D status and risk for gestational diabetes (GDM) a nested case-control study BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to impaired glucose metabolism. There are sparse data regarding vitamin D and the development of gestational diabetes (GDM). The objective of this study was to assess if first-trimester vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in women later diagnosed with GDM compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of pregnant women who had previously given blood for routine genetic multiple marker screening and subsequently delivered at a tertiary hospital between November 2004 and July 2009. From an overall cohort of 4225 women, 60 cases of GDM were matched by race/ethnicity with 120 women delivering at term (_37 weeks) with uncomplicated pregnancies. Banked maternal serum was used to measure maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. RESULTS: The prevalence of first-trimester maternal vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25(OH)D_< _50 nmol/L) was comparable among women with GDM compared with controls (5/60 vs 8/120, p_=_0.90).

1389,"The effect of progressive, reinforcing telephone education and counseling versus brief educational intervention on knowledge, self-care behaviors and heart failure symptoms BACKGROUND: The optimal strategy for promoting self-care for heart failure (HF) is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether a ""teach to goal"" (TTG) educational and behavioral support program provided incremental benefits to a brief (1 hour) educational intervention (BEI) for knowledge, self-care behaviors, and HF-related quality of life (HFQOL). The TTG program taught use of adjusted-dose diuretics and then reinforced learning goals and behaviors with 5 to 8 telephone counseling sessions over 1 month. Participants' (n_= 605) mean age was 61 years; 37% had marginal or inadequate literacy; 69% had ejection fraction < 0.45; and 31% had Class III or IV symptoms. The TTG group had greater improvements in general and salt knowledge (P < .001) and greater increases in self-care behaviors (from mean 4.8 to 7.6 for TTG vs. 5.2 to 6.7 for BEI; P < .001). HFQOL improved from 58.5 to 64.6 for the TTG group but did not change for the BEI group (64.7 to 63.9; P < .001 for the difference in change scores). Improvements were similar regardless of participants' literacy level. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone reinforcement of learning goals and self-care behaviors improved knowledge, health behaviors, and HF-related QOL compared to a single education session.

1390,"""Teach to goal"": theory and design principles of an intervention to improve heart failure self-management skills of patients with low health literacy Self-management is vital for achieving optimal health outcomes for patients with heart failure (HF). We sought to develop an intervention to improve self-management skills and behaviors for patients with HF, especially those with low health literacy. Individuals with low health literacy have difficulty reading and understanding written information and comprehending numerical information and performing calculations, and they tend to have worse baseline knowledge, short-term memory, and working memory compared with individuals with higher health literacy. This paper describes theoretical models that suggest methods to improve the design of educational curricula and programs for low literate audiences, including cognitive load theory and learning mastery theory. We also outline the practical guiding principles for designing our intervention, which includes a multisession educational strategy that teaches patients self-care skills until they reach behavioral goals (""Teach to Goal""). Our intervention strategy is being tested in a randomized controlled trial to determine if it is superior to a single-session brief educational intervention for reducing hospitalization and death. If this trial shows that the ""Teach to Goal"" approach is superior, it would support the value of incorporating these design principles into educational interventions for other diseases.",,,5,,,

1392,"The role of reproductive hormones in the development and maintenance of eating disorders Much remains to be understood about the etiology of eating disorders. There is substantial evidence that reproductive hormones, specifically estrogens, play a direct role in normal food intake. Evidence is increasing that the reproductive hormones play a role in the abnormal food intake associated with eating disorders. For example, there is an inverse association between estradiol and eating disorder symptoms. Preliminary studies also suggest that hormone augmentation may be a beneficial adjunct to the standard treatment of choice for eating disorders. However, research is limited, so definitive conclusions about the benefit of hormone augmentation in treatment cannot be drawn. Future research, with a focus on translational studies, should continue to explore the role of reproductive hormones in the vulnerability to and maintenance of eating disorders.",,,7,,,
1393,"Body dissatisfaction in adolescent boys Body dissatisfaction is a significant mental health symptom present in adolescent girls and boys. However, it is often either disregarded in adolescent boys or examined using assessments that may not resonate with males. The present study addresses these issues, examining the manifestation, etiology, and correlates of 3 facets of body dissatisfaction in adolescent boys. Adolescent male twins aged 16- to 17-years-old from the Swedish Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development were included along with a female comparison group: 915 monozygotic and 671 dizygotic same-sex twins. Body dissatisfaction was defined using measures of height dissatisfaction, muscle dissatisfaction, and the body dissatisfaction subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-BD). We examined the prevalence of body dissatisfaction, whether the facets of body dissatisfaction were phenotypically and etiologically distinct, and associations with specific externalizing and internalizing symptoms. For boys, muscle dissatisfaction scores were greater than height dissatisfaction scores. Results also indicated that height and muscle dissatisfaction were phenotypically and etiologically distinct from the EDI-BD. Unique associations were observed with externalizing and internalizing symptoms: muscle dissatisfaction with symptoms of bulimia nervosa and the EDI-BD with internalizing symptoms, body mass index, and drive for thinness. The facets of body dissatisfaction were also largely distinct in girls and unique between-sex associations with externalizing and internalizing symptoms emerged. Overall, male-oriented aspects of body dissatisfaction are distinct from female-oriented aspects of body dissatisfaction. To capture the full picture of male body dissatisfaction, multiple facets must be addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",,,1,,,
1394,"Shared genetic effects between age at menarche and disordered eating PURPOSE: An early age at menarche is associated with disordered eating in women. However, it is unclear whether they share genetic factors. The goal of the current study was to delineate the genetic correlation between age at menarche and disordered eating. METHODS: Participants included 427 monozygotic and 329 dizygotic 16-17-year-old female twins from the Swedish Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development. Disordered eating was assessed with the Eating Disorder Inventory-2. Age at menarche was assessed through self-report. A bivariate correlated factors model was used to delineate the genetic correlation between age at menarche and disordered eating. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a negative genetic correlation of -.18 in the best-fit model, indicating that the genetic factors that influence younger age at menarche are associated with increased liability for disordered eating. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should examine possible causes for this correlation, such as the estrogen system and gene-environment interactions. Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,3,,,

1396,"Arsenic-gene interactions and beta-cell function in the Strong Heart Family Study We explored arsenic-gene interactions influencing pancreatic beta-cell activity in the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). We considered 42 variants selected for associations with either beta-cell function (31 variants) or arsenic metabolism (11 variants) in the SHFS. Beta-cell function was calculated as homeostatic model - beta corrected for insulin resistance (cHOMA-B) by regressing homeostatic model - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) on HOMA-B and adding mean HOMA-B. Arsenic exposure was dichotomized at the median of the sum of creatinine-corrected inorganic and organic arsenic species measured by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICPMS). Additive GxE models for cHOMA-B were adjusted for age and ancestry, and accounted for family relationships. Models were stratified by center (Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota) and meta-analyzed. The two interactions between higher vs. lower arsenic and SNPs for cHOMA-B that were nominally significant at P_< _0.05 were with rs10738708 (SNP overall effect -3.91, P_=_0.56; interaction effect with arsenic -31.14, P_=_0.02) and rs4607517 (SNP overall effect +16.61, P_=_0.03; interaction effect with arsenic +27.02, P_=_0.03). The corresponding genes GCK and TUSC1 suggest oxidative stress and apoptosis as possible mechanisms for arsenic impacts on beta-cell function. No interactions were Bonferroni-significant (1.16__10-3). Our findings are suggestive of oligogenic moderation of arsenic impacts on pancreatic _-cell endocrine function, but were not Bonferroni-significant. Copyright _ 2018 Elsevier Inc.

1398,"Association of Cardiometabolic Genes with Arsenic Metabolism Biomarkers in American Indian Communities: The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) BACKGROUND: Metabolism of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is subject to inter-individual variability, which is explained partly by genetic determinants. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association of genetic variants with arsenic species and principal components of arsenic species in the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). METHODS: We examined variants previously associated with cardiometabolic traits (~ 200,000 from Illumina Cardio MetaboChip) or arsenic metabolism and toxicity (670) among 2,428 American Indian participants in the SHFS. Urine arsenic species were measured by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS), and percent arsenic species [iAs, monomethylarsonate (MMA), and dimethylarsinate (DMA), divided by their sum _ 100] were logit transformed. We created two orthogonal principal components that summarized iAs, MMA, and DMA and were also phenotypes for genetic analyses. Linear regression was performed for each phenotype, dependent on allele dosage of the variant. Models accounted for familial relatedness and were adjusted for age, sex, total arsenic levels, and population stratification. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were stratified by study site and were meta-analyzed. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple testing. RESULTS: Variants at 10q24 were statistically significant for all percent arsenic species and principal components of arsenic species. The index SNP for iAs%, MMA%, and DMA% (rs12768205) and for the principal components (rs3740394, rs3740393) were located near AS3MT, whose gene product catalyzes methylation of iAs to MMA and DMA. Among the candidate arsenic variant associations, functional SNPs in AS3MT and 10q24 were most significant (p < 9.33 _ 10-5). CONCLUSIONS: This hypothesis-driven association study supports the role of common variants in arsenic metabolism, particularly AS3MT and 10q24.

1399,"Genetic variants related to cardiometabolic traits are associated to B cell function, insulin resistance, and diabetes among american indians: the strong heart family study Background: Genetic research may inform underlying mechanisms for disparities in the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus among American Indians. Our objective was to assess the association of genetic variants in cardiometabolic candidate genes with B cell dysfunction via HOMA-B, insulin resistance via HOMA-IR, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). Methods and Results: We examined the association of variants, previously associated with cardiometabolic traits (_200,000 from Illumina Cardio MetaboChip), using mixed models of HOMA-B residuals corrected for HOMA-IR (cHOMA-B), log transformed HOMA-IR, and incident diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, population stratification, and familial relatedness. Center-specific estimates were combined using fixed effect meta-analyses. We used Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing (P < 4.13 _ 10-7). We also assessed the association between variants in candidate diabetes genes with these metabolic traits. We explored the top SNPs in an independent, replication sample from Southwestern Arizona. We identified significant associations with cHOMA-B for common variants at 26 loci of which 8 were novel (PRSS7, FCRL5, PEL1, LRP12, IGLL1, ARHGEF10, PARVA, FLJ16686). The most significant variant association with cHOMA-B was observed on chromosome 5 for an intergenic variant near PARP8 (rs2961831, P = 6.39 _ 10-9). In the replication study, we found a signal at rs4607517 near GCK/YKT6 (P = 0.01). Variants near candidate diabetes genes (especially GCK and KCNQ1) were also nominally associated with HOMA-IR and cHOMA-B. Conclusion: We identified variants at novel loci and confirmed those at known candidate diabetes loci associations for cHOMA-B. This study also provided evidence for association of variants at KCNQ2, CTNAA2, and KCNQ1with cHOMA-B among American Indians. Further studies are needed to account for the high heritability of diabetes among the American Indian participants of the SHFS cohort.",,,8,,,
1400,"Independent associations of childhood and current socioeconomic status with risk of self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis in a family-medicine cohort of North-Carolinians BACKGROUND: Associations of socioeconomic status (SES) with the prevalence of various forms of arthritis are well documented. Increasing evidence suggests that SES during childhood is a lasting determinant of health, but its association with the onset of arthritis remains unclear. METHODS: Cross-sectional data on 1276 participants originated from 22 family practices in North-Carolina, USA. We created 4-level (high, medium, low, lowest) current SES and childhood SES summary scores based on parental and participant education, occupation and homeownership. We investigated associations of individual SES characteristics, summary scores and SES trajectories (e.g. high/low) with self-reported arthritis in logistic regression models progressively adjusted for race and gender, age, then BMI, and clustered by family practice. RESULTS: We found evidence for independent associations of both childhood and current SES with the reporting of arthritis across our models. In covariate-adjusted models simultaneously including current and childhood SES, compared with high SES participants in the lowest childhood SES category (OR_=_1.39 [95% CI_=_1.04, 1.85]) and those in the low (OR_=_1.66 [95% CI_=_1.14, 2.42]) and lowest (OR_=_2.08 [95% CI_=_1.16, 3.74]) categories of current SES had significantly greater odds of having self-reported arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: Current SES and childhood SES are both associated with the odds of reporting arthritis within this primary-care population, although the possibly superseding influence of existing circumstances must be noted. BMI was a likely mechanism in the association of childhood SES with arthritis onset, and research is needed to elucidate further pathways linking the socioeconomic environment across life-stages and the development of rheumatic diseases.",,,9,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine the influences of current and childhood SES on self-reported disability, depression, and physical and mental health among people with self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis. METHODS: Data originated from a North Carolina network of primary care centers. Participants with self-reported arthritis with complete sociodemographic and relevant health information were retained in our sample (n = 782). We created summary measures for current and childhood SES from indicators of education, occupation, and homeownership, using parental SES as a proxy for participants' childhood SES. Linear regression models were used to assess the associations between health outcomes and SES variables separately and together, adjusting for key covariates. RESULTS: Lower childhood and current SES scores were associated with worse disability and physical health. Current SES was furthermore associated with mental health and depressive symptoms. Associations of low current and childhood SES with health outcomes remained significant when concurrently included in a linear model. CONCLUSION: Childhood and current SES are both determinants of health among persons with arthritis. This underscores the importance of childhood SES as a determinant of adult health among individuals with arthritis. Further studies should focus on these associations in different populations and across different types of arthritis. Copyright _ 2013 by the American College of Rheumatology.",,,9,,,
1402,"Socioeconomic disparities in the health of african americans with rheumatoid arthritis from the southeastern United States OBJECTIVE: To examine cross-sectional baseline data from the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis registry for the association between socioeconomic status (SES) with clinical and self-report health outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed data on 937 African Americans who provided comprehensive sociodemographic data in addition to self-reported health outcomes. SES measures included educational attainment, homeownership, household income, and occupation. Outcomes included measures of disease activity, joint damage, autoantibody status, and self-reported measures. Multivariable linear, logistic, and zero-inflated Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations of each SES measure with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outcomes, controlling for sex, age, disease duration, comorbid conditions, body mass index, smoking, methotrexate/leflunomide use, and biologic agent use. RESULTS: The mean age was 54 years, 86% were women, and the mean RA disease duration was 7.8 years. Approximately 24% had less than a high school degree, 56% had a nonprofessional occupation, 75% had a household income _$30,000, and 55% were nonhomeowners. In multivariable regression models, significantly increased associations of disease activity measures and self-reported health outcomes were observed with low household income (_$30,000/year) and nonhomeownership. Education less than high school was primarily associated with self-reported health outcomes. Among participants with disease duration < 2 years, associations of SES were confined to self-reported measures. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate significant socioeconomic disparities in self-reported physical and mental health, clinical disease activity measures, and autoantibody status among African Americans with RA not explained by differences in demographics, medication use, and health behaviors.

1403,"Socioeconomic factors and self-reported health outcomes in African Americans with rheumatoid arthritis from the Southeastern United States: the contribution of childhood socioeconomic status BACKGROUND: There is abundant evidence that low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with worse health outcomes among people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA); however, the influence of socioeconomic disadvantage in early life has yet to be studied within that population. METHODS: Data originated from the cross-sectional arm of the Consortium Evaluation of African-Americans with Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR II), which recruited African-Americans with RA from six sites in the Southeastern United States. We used linear regression models to evaluate associations of parental homeownership status and educational level at participant time of birth with participant-reported fatigue (Visual Analog scale, cm), pain (Visual Analog scale, cm), disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire) and helplessness (Rheumatology Attitudes Index), independently of participant homeownership status and educational level. Models included random effects to account for intra-site correlations, and were adjusted for variables identified using backward selection, from: age, disease-duration, sex, medication use, body-mass index, smoking history. RESULTS: Our sample included 516 CLEAR II participants with full data on demographics and covariates. 89% of participants were women, the mean age was 54.7 years and mean disease duration was 10.8 years. In age adjusted models, parental non-homeownership was associated with greater fatigue (__=_0.75, 95% CI_=_0.36-1.14), disability (__=_0.12, 95% CI_=_0.04-0.19) and helplessness (__=_0.12, 95% CI_=_0.03-0.21), independently of participant homeownership and education; parental education had a further small influence on self-reported fatigue (__=_0.20, 95% CI_=_0.15-0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Parental homeownership, and to a small extent parental education, had modest but meaningful relationships with self-reported health among CLEAR II participants.",,,3,,,
1404,"Improved detection of epigenomic marks with mixed-effects hidden Markov models Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique to detect genomic regions containing protein-DNA interaction, such as transcription factor binding sites or regions containing histone modifications. One goal of the analysis of ChIP-seq experiments is to identify genomic loci enriched for sequencing reads pertaining to DNA bound to the factor of interest. The accurate identification of such regions aids in the understanding of epigenomic marks and gene regulatory mechanisms. Given the reduction of massively parallel sequencing costs, methods to detect consensus regions of enrichment across multiple samples are of interest. Here, we present a statistical model to detect broad consensus regions of enrichment from ChIP-seq technical or biological replicates through a class of zero-inflated mixed-effects hidden Markov models. We show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods for consensus peak calling in common epigenomic marks by accounting for the excess zeros and sample-specific biases. We apply our method to data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements and Roadmap Epigenomics projects and also from an extensive simulation study. _ 2019 The International Biometric Society.",,,5,,,
1405,"Exploring the genomic basis of early childhood caries: a pilot study OBJECTIVE: A genetic component in early childhood caries (ECC) is theorized, but no genome-wide investigations of ECC have been conducted. This pilot study is part of a long-term research program aimed to: (1) determine the proportion of ECC variance attributable to the human genome and (2) identify ECC-associated genetic loci. METHODS: The study's community-based sample comprised 212 children (mean age=39_months; range_=_30-52_months; males_=_55%; Hispanic/Latino_=_35%, African-American_=_32%; American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry definition of ECC prevalence_=_38%). Approximately 2.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using DNA purified from saliva. A P_< _5___10-8 criterion was used for genome-wide significance. SNPs with P_< _5___10-5 were followed-up in three independent cohorts of 921 preschool-age children with similar ECC prevalence. RESULTS: SNPs with minor allele frequency _5% explained 52% (standard error_=_54%) of ECC variance (one-sided P_=_0.03). Unsurprisingly, given the pilot's small sample size, no genome-wide significant associations were found. An intergenic locus on 4q32 (rs4690994) displayed the strongest association with ECC [P_=_2.3___10-6 ; odds ratio (OR)_=_3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI)_=_2.1-5.9]. Thirteen loci with suggestive associations were followed-up - none showed evidence of association in the replication samples. CONCLUSION: This study's findings support a heritable component of ECC and demonstrate the feasibility of conducting genomics studies among preschool-age children. _ 2017 The Authors.

1406,"Association of nonobstructive chronic bronchitis with respiratory health outcomes in adults Importance: Chronic bronchitis has been associated with cigarette smoking as well as with e-cigarette use among young adults, but the association of chronic bronchitis in persons without airflow obstruction or clinical asthma, described as nonobstructive chronic bronchitis, with respiratory health outcomes remains uncertain. Objective: To assess whether nonobstructive chronic bronchitis is associated with adverse respiratory health outcomes in adult ever smokers and never smokers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 22_325 adults without initial airflow obstruction (defined as the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] to forced vital capacity [FVC] of < 0.70) or clinical asthma at baseline. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Pooled Cohorts Study harmonized and pooled data from 9 US general population-based cohorts. Thus present study is based on data from 5 of these cohorts. Participants were enrolled from August 1971 through May 2007 and were followed up through December 2018. Exposures: Nonobstructive chronic bronchitis was defined by questionnaire at baseline as both cough and phlegm for at least 3 months for at least 2 consecutive years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Lung function was measured by prebronchodilator spirometry. Hospitalizations and deaths due to chronic lower respiratory disease and respiratory disease-related mortality were defined by events adjudication and administrative criteria. Models were stratified by smoking status and adjusted for anthropometric, sociodemographic, and smoking-related factors. The comparison group was participants without nonobstructive chronic bronchitis. Results: Among 22_325 adults included in the analysis, mean (SD) age was 53.0 (16.3) years (range, 18.0-95.0 years), 58.2% were female, 65.9% were non-Hispanic white, and 49.6% were ever smokers. Among 11_082 ever smokers with 99_869 person-years of follow-up, participants with nonobstructive chronic bronchitis (300 [2.7%]) had accelerated decreases in FEV1 (4.1 mL/y; 95% CI, 2.1-6.1 mL/y) and FVC (4.7 mL/y; 95% CI, 2.2-7.2 mL/y), increased risks of chronic lower respiratory disease-related hospitalization or mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7-2.7), and greater respiratory disease-related (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8) compared with ever smokers without nonobstructive chronic bronchitis. Among 11_243 never smokers with 120_004 person-years of follow-up, participants with nonobstructive chronic bronchitis (151 [1.3%]) had greater rates of chronic lower respiratory disease-related hospitalization or mortality (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.1-4.5) compared with never smokers without nonobstructive chronic bronchitis. Nonobstructive chronic bronchitis was not associated with FEV1:FVC decline or incident airflow obstruction. The presence of at least 1 of the component symptoms of nonobstructive chronic bronchitis (ie, chronic cough or phlegm), which was common in both ever smokers (11.0%) and never smokers (6.7%), was associated with adverse respiratory health outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that nonobstructive chronic bronchitis is associated with adverse respiratory health outcomes, particularly in ever smokers, and may be a high-risk phenotype suitable for risk stratification and targeted therapies.",,,9,,,
1407,"More than just tracking time: Complex measures of user engagement with an internet-based health promotion intervention BACKGROUND: There has been a rise in internet-based health interventions without a concomitant focus on new methods to measure user engagement and its effect on outcomes. We describe current user tracking methods for internet-based health interventions and offer suggestions for improvement based on the design and pilot testing of healthMpowerment.org (HMP). METHODS: HMP is a multi-component online intervention for young Black men and transgender women who have sex with men (YBMSM/TW) to reduce risky sexual behaviors, promote healthy living and build social support. The intervention is non-directive, incorporates interactive features, and utilizes a point-based reward system. Fifteen YBMSM/TW (age 20-30) participated in a one-month pilot study to test the usability and efficacy of HMP. Engagement with the intervention was tracked using a customized data capture system and validated with Google Analytics. Usage was measured in time spent (total and across sections) and points earned. RESULTS: Average total time spent on HMP was five hours per person (range 0-13). Total time spent was correlated with total points earned and overall site satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Measuring engagement in internet-based interventions is crucial to determining efficacy. Multiple methods of tracking helped derive more comprehensive user profiles. Results highlighted the limitations of measures to capture user activity and the elusiveness of the concept of engagement.

1408,"From voice to choice: african american youth examine childhood obesity in rural north carolina BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity continues to be a prominent health concern in the United States. Certain demographics of youth have a higher prevalence of obesity, including those living in rural settings, and African American females. Multiple determinants contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic, yet few studies have partnered with youth to investigate community-level determinants and solutions. OBJECTIVES: This study involved youth to assess contextual determinants of childhood obesity in a community, create an action plan for the community, and report findings and actions pursued in partnership with a community-based organization (CBO) and a university. METHODS: Seven African American female high school students were recruited to investigate factors that contribute to childhood obesity using photovoice, a methodology used in community-based participatory research (CBPR). RESULTS: Through photography and guided discussion, youth partners found a lack of access to healthy food and lack of safe recreation as primary contributors to obesity within their community. Social support from friends was believed to help prevent obesity. In response to findings, two projects were envisioned and implemented in the community, a walkability assessment and an intergenerational community garden. CONCLUSIONS: Throughout this study, youth proved to be reliable partners in research, provided unique perspectives while examining local factors perceived to contribute to childhood obesity, and offered thoughtful solutions.",,,4,,,
1409,"Microfinance and health interventions: Factors influencing loan repayment success with young men in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania Poverty is associated with numerous poor health outcomes. Youth unemployment in Tanzania is approximately 13.7%, and concentrates in urban areas. These youth lack relevant job skills and access to financial capital. Microfinance continues to be implemented globally to address poverty, and increasingly has been linked to health interventions. Men less frequently are recipients of microfinance loans. We offered microcredit to young men in an area of Dar es Salaam with high poverty as part of a randomised controlled-trial to assess the efficacy of a microfinance and health leadership intervention in preventing STI acquisition. We used mixed methods to understand predictors of successful loan repayment. Our qualitative sub-study showed that leader influence, prior business experience, personal motivation, and planning facilitated repayment. Using a modified Poisson approach, our quantitative analysis showed that successful repayment was associated with business experience, education, increasing number of children, community of residence, percentage of network members trained in business, and repayment success of peer leaders. Our results suggest that enforcing group accountability and repayment rules, offering ongoing training, and using successful entrepreneurs as role models could increase repayment success in similar populations. These strategies could provide financial opportunity for men while minimising risk for microfinance institutions.",,,2,,,
1410,"Association of modifiable risk factors in young adulthood with racial disparity in incident type 2 diabetes during middle adulthood Importance: In the United States, black individuals are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with white individuals, and these disparities are particularly pronounced in young and middle age. Prior studies have identified differences in traditional risk factors that may be associated with racial disparities in diabetes incidence but have not simultaneously adjusted for risk factors measured across multiple domains (eg, the individual and the environment) and updated over time. Objective: To determine the relative associations of modifiable biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors in young adulthood with the observed racial disparity in diabetes incidence between middle-aged black and white individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: Black and white men and women from the observational Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, aged 18 to 30 years, without diabetes at baseline (1985-1986; N_=_4251) were observed through 2015-2016. Sex-stratified multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling, with adjustment for time-updated covariates, was used to estimate risk for incident diabetes. Percent reduction in the _ coefficient (the logarithm used to calculate the hazard ratio [HR]) was calculated to compare black to white participants. Exposures: Self-identified race and factors including biological (eg, fasting glucose, body mass index), neighborhood (racial segregation and tract-level poverty), psychosocial (depressive symptoms), socioeconomic (eg, personal and parental educational attainment, current employment), and behavioral (eg, regular alcohol consumption, smoking) domains. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: The mean (SD) age at baseline was 25 (3.6) years, 49% (n_=_2066) of the sample was black, and 54% (n_=_2304) were women. Over a mean follow-up of 24.5 years, 504 cases of incident diabetes were identified. Using sex-stratified multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, black women and men were more likely to develop diabetes than white men and women (black women: HR, 2.86 [95% CI, 2.19-3.72] and risk difference [RD], 89 cases/1000 people [95% CI, 61-117]; black men: HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.28-2.17] and RD, 47 cases/1000 people [95% CI, 15-78]) after adjustment for age and center. Biological factors were most strongly associated with the disparity in diabetes risk between black and white individuals for women (percent reduction in _, 112%) and men (percent reduction in _, 86%). There was no longer disparity in diabetes risk between black and white middle-aged adults after adjustment for biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors measured over time (HR for women, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.55-1.14]; HR for men, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.62-1.38]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study comparing black and white participants, there was a statistically significant increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes among black women and men. However, after adjustment for modifiable risk factors during young adulthood, the disparity was no longer statistically significant.",,,3,,,
1411,"Obesity, body fat distribution, and risk of breast cancer subtypes in African American women participating in the AMBER Consortium African American (AA) women are more likely than white women to be obese and to be diagnosed with ER- and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer, but few studies have evaluated the impact of obesity and body fat distribution on breast cancer subtypes in AA women. We evaluated these associations in the AMBER Consortium by pooling data from four large studies. Cases were categorized according to hormone receptor status as ER+, ER-, and TN (ER-, PR-, and HER2-) based on pathology data. A total of 2104 ER+ cases, 1070 ER- cases (including 491 TN cases), and 12,060 controls were included. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were computed using logistic regression, taking into account breast cancer risk factors. In postmenopausal women, higher recent (most proximal value to diagnosis/index date) BMI was associated with increased risk of ER+ cancer (OR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.02-1.67 for BMI _ 35 vs. < 25 kg/m(2)) and with decreased risk of TN tumors (OR 0.60; 95 % CI 0.39-0.93 for BMI _ 35 vs. < 25). High young adult BMI was associated with decreased premenopausal ER+ cancer and all subtypes of postmenopausal cancer, and high recent waist-to-hip ratio with increased risk of premenopausal ER+ tumors (OR 1.35; 95 % CI 1.01-1.80) and all tumor subtypes combined in postmenopausal women (OR 1.26; 95 % CI 1.02-1.56). The impact of general and central obesity varies by menopausal status and hormone receptor subtype in AA women. Our findings imply different mechanisms for associations of adiposity with TN and ER+ breast cancers.",,,3,,,
1412,"At risk alcohol consumption with smoking by national background: Results from the Hispanic community health study/study of Latinos INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking and binge or excess drinking are unhealthy behaviors that frequently co-occur. Studies of Hispanics/Latinos have mostly been of Mexican Americans although there are substantial differences in smoking and drinking by heritage background. Associated with co-use by 5 subpopulations. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 16,412 Hispanics/Latinos from Miami, the Bronx, Chicago and San Diego collected between 2008 and 2011 as part of the HCHS/SOL were analyzed. Smoking and alcohol consumption and demographic data were measured by self-report. Prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption and co-use were reported. Logistic regression models examined the odds of co-use of smoking and binge or excess alcohol use by Hispanic/Latino background group. RESULTS: Men of Cuban (10.3%), Puerto Rican (8.9%), and Mexican (8.9%) background had the highest prevalence of co-use of smoking and binge drinking compared to men of Central American (6.1%) and Dominican (6.6%) background. Women of Dominican (16.4%) and Puerto Rican (19.7%) background had the highest prevalence of binge drinking compared to women of Central American (10%) and Cuban (8%) background and Puerto Rican (34.1%) and Cuban (21.8%) women were the most likely to report current smoking compared to women of Central American (8.3%) and Mexican (10.4%) background.

1413,"Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Safety Event Reporting: PROSPER Consortium guidance The Patient-Reported Outcomes Safety Event Reporting (PROSPER) Consortium was convened to improve safety reporting by better incorporating the perspective of the patient. PROSPER comprises industry, regulatory authority, academic, private sector and patient representatives who are interested in the area of patient-reported outcomes of adverse events (PRO-AEs). It has developed guidance on PRO-AE data, including the benefits of wider use and approaches for data capture and analysis. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) encompass the full range of self-reporting, rather than only patient reports collected by clinicians using validated instruments. In recent years, PROs have become increasingly important across the spectrum of healthcare and life sciences. Patient-centred models of care are integrating shared decision making and PROs at the point of care; comparative effectiveness research seeks to include patients as participatory stakeholders; and industry is expanding its involvement with patients and patient groups as part of the drug development process and safety monitoring. Additionally, recent pharmacovigilance legislation from regulatory authorities in the EU and the USA calls for the inclusion of patient-reported information in benefit-risk assessment of pharmaceutical products. For patients, technological advancements have made it easier to be an active participant in one's healthcare. Simplified internet search capabilities, electronic and personal health records, digital mobile devices, and PRO-enabled patient online communities are just a few examples of tools that allow patients to gain increased knowledge about conditions, symptoms, treatment options and side effects. Despite these changes and increased attention on the perceived value of PROs, their full potential has yet to be realised in pharmacovigilance. Current safety reporting and risk assessment processes remain heavily dependent on healthcare professionals, though there are known limitations such as under-reporting and discordant perspectives between patient reports and clinician perceptions of adverse outcomes. PROSPER seeks to support the wider use of PRO-AEs. The scope of this guidance document, which was completed between July 2011 and March 2013, considered a host of domains related to PRO-AEs, including definitions and suitable taxonomies, the range of datasets that could be used, data collection mechanisms, and suitable analytical methodologies. PROSPER offers an innovative framework to differentiate patient populations. This framework considers populations that are prespecified (such as those in clinical trials, prospective observational studies and some registries) and non-prespecified populations (such as those in claims databases, PRO-enabled online patient networks, and social websites in general). While the main focus of this guidance is on post-approval PRO-AEs from both prespecified and non-prespecified population groups, PROSPER has also considered pre-approval, prespecified populations. The ultimate aim of this guidance is to ensure that the patient 'voice' and perspective feed appropriately into collection of safety data. The guidance also covers a minimum core dataset for use by industry or regulators to structure PRO-AEs (accessible in the online appendix) and how data, once collected, might be evaluated to better inform on the safe and effective use of medicinal products. Structured collection of such patient data can be considered both a means to an end (improving patient safety) as well as an end in itself (expressing the patient viewpoint). The members of the PROSPER Consortium therefore direct this PRO-AE guidance to multiple stakeholders in drug safety, including industry, regulators, prescribers and patients. The use of this document across the entirety of the drug development life cycle will help to better define the benefit-risk profile of new and existing medicines. Because of the clinical relevance of 'real-world' data, PROs have the potential to contribute important new knowledge about the benefits and risks of medi inal products, communicated through the voice of the patient.",,,1,,,
1414,"BET bromodomain inhibition as a novel strategy for reactivation of HIV-1 The persistence of latent HIV-1 remains a major challenge in therapeutic efforts to eradicate infection. We report the capacity for HIV reactivation by a selective small molecule inhibitor of BET family bromodomains, JQ1, a promising therapeutic agent with antioncogenic properties. JQ1 reactivated HIV transcription in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection. We also tested the effect of exposure to JQ1 to allow recovery of replication-competent HIV from pools of resting CD4(+) T cells isolated from HIV-infected, ART-treated patients. In one of three patients, JQ1 allowed recovery of virus at a frequency above unstimulated conditions. JQ1 potently suppressed T cell proliferation with minimal cytotoxic effect. Transcriptional profiling of T cells with JQ1 showed potent down-regulation of T cell activation genes, including CD3, CD28, and CXCR4, similar to HDAC inhibitors, but JQ1 also showed potent up-regulation of chromatin modification genes, including SIRT1, HDAC6, and multiple lysine demethylases (KDMs). Thus, JQ1 reactivates HIV-1 while suppressing T cell activation genes and up-regulating histone modification genes predicted to favor increased Tat activity. Thus, JQ1 may be useful in studies of potentially novel mechanisms for transcriptional control as well as in translational efforts to identify therapeutic molecules to achieve viral eradication.",,,6,,,
1415,"Assessing Positive Child Health among Individuals Born Extremely Preterm OBJECTIVE: To assess the development of a Positive Child Health Index (PCHI) based on 11 adverse outcomes and evaluate the association of PCHI with quality of life (QoL) scores in a preterm cohort. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 889 children enrolled in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) study in 2002-2004 were followed up at 10 years of age. A parent/caregiver completed questionnaires for child QoL, asthma, visual or hearing impairment, gross motor function impairment, epilepsy, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. The child was assessed for cognitive impairment, autism, and obesity. PCHI scores were computed and linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between QoL categories (psychosocial, physical, emotional, social, school, and total) and the PCHI (dichotomized and coded as a multilevel categorical predictor) and to assess sex differences. RESULTS: Among ELGAN children, higher PCHI scores were associated with higher reported QoL scores for all QoL categories. Children with no disorders and a PCHI of 100% had Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory total scores that were 11 points higher than children with 1 or more adverse outcomes (PCHI of < 100%). Boys had lower QoL scores for the total, psychosocial, social, and school categories. CONCLUSIONS: Positive child health assessed using a quantitative PCHI was associated with QoL across the ELGAN cohort at school age. In the current study, the PCHI encompassed 11 outcomes assessed in ELGANs. Future research could include an enhanced panel of child health outcomes to support the use of PCHI as an indicator of positive child health. Copyright _ 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,1,,,
1416,"Early life antecedents of positive child health among 10-year-old children born extremely preterm BACKGROUND: To identify modifiable antecedents during pre-pregnancy and pregnancy windows associated with a positive child health at 10 years of age. METHODS: Data on 889 children enrolled in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) study in 2002-2004 were analyzed for associations between potentially modifiable maternal antecedents during pre-pregnancy and pregnancy time windows and a previously described positive child health index (PCHI) score at 10 years of age. Stratification by race was also investigated for associations with investigated antecedents. RESULTS: Factors associated with higher PCHI (more positive health) included greater gestational age, birth weight, multiple gestation, and medical interventions, including assisted reproduction and cervical cerclage. Factors associated with lower PCHI included correlates of lower socioeconomic status, pre-pregnancy chronic medical disorders in the mother such as pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and maternal asthma. When stratified by race, variation in significant results was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Among children born extremely preterm, medical interventions and higher socioeconomic status were associated with improved PCHI, while chronic illness and high BMI in the mother is associated with lower PCHI at 10 years of age. Knowledge of such antecedent factors could inform efforts to develop interventions that promote positive child health outcomes in future pregnancies.",,,3,,,
1417,"Risk factors for antiretroviral therapy (ART) discontinuation in a large multinational trial of early ART initiators OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate potential causes of higher risk of treatment interruptions within the multicountry Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) trial in 2015. METHODS: We defined baseline as the date of starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a treatment interruption as discontinuing ART for at least 2 weeks. Participants were stratified by randomization arm and followed from baseline to earliest end date of the initial phase of START, death, date of consent withdrawn or date of first treatment interruption. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for factors that may predict treatment interruptions in each arm. RESULTS: Of the 3438 participants who started ART, 2286 were in the immediate arm and 1152 in the deferred arm. 12.9% of people in the immediate arm and 10.5% of people in the deferred arm experienced at least one treatment interruption by 3 years after starting ART. In adjusted analyses, age [hazard ratio for 35-50 years: 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.97) and >50 years: 0.53 (0.33-0.80) vs. < 35 years], education status [hazard ratio for postgraduate education vs. less than high-school education (0.23 (0.10-0.50))] and region [hazard ratio for United States vs. Europe/Israel (3.16 (2.09-4.77))] were significantly associated with treatment interruptions in the immediate arm. In the deferred arm, age and education status were significantly associated with treatment interruptions. CONCLUSION: Within START, we identified younger age and lower educational attainment as potential causes of ART interruption. There is a need to strengthen adherence advice and wider social support in younger people and those of lower education status.",,,3,,,
1418,"Process evaluation of a food marketing and environmental change intervention in Tiendas that serve Latino immigrants in North Carolina This article describes a comprehensive process evaluation of an efficacious store-based intervention that increased store customers' fruit and vegetable consumption. The process evaluation plan was designed at study inception and implemented at baseline, during the intervention, and at immediate postintervention. Four Latino food stores were randomly assigned either to an intervention or to a control condition. Data were collected from store managers, employees, and 139 Latino customers. Researchers used manager, employee, and customer interviews; weekly observations of the store environment; and implementation logs to assess reach, dose delivered, dose received, and fidelity. Results indicated that it is possible to reach customers in a store-based intervention. Indicators of dose delivered demonstrated that the intervention was implemented as planned, and in the case of employee training, it exceeded the plan. Dose received data indicated that customers moderately engaged with the intervention activities. Together these suggest that the intervention was delivered with good fidelity. Comprehensive process evaluation efforts can facilitate the identification and elimination of barriers to implementation. This approach can serve as a model for future store-based interventions. The study demonstrated that it is feasible to implement Latino food store-based interventions to increase access to and consumption of fruits and vegetables. _ 2014 Society for Public Health Education.",,,7,,,
1419,"Burden of HIV among female sex workers in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis BACKGROUND: Female sex workers are a population who are at heightened risk of HIV infection secondary to biological, behavioural, and structural risk factors. However, three decades into the HIV pandemic, understanding of the burden of HIV among these women remains limited. We aimed to assess the burden of HIV in this population compared with that of other women of reproductive age. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Global Health, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and POPLine for studies of female sex workers in low-income and middle-income countries published between Jan 1, 2007, and June 25, 2011. Studies of any design that measured the prevalence or incidence of HIV among female sex workers, even if sex workers were not the main focus of the study, were included. Meta-analyses were done with the Mantel-Haenszel method with a random-effects model characterising an odds ratio for the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers compared with that for all women of reproductive age. FINDINGS: Of 434 selected articles and surveillance reports, 102 were included in the analyses, representing 99,878 female sex workers in 50 countries. The overall HIV prevalence was 11_8% (95% CI 11_6-12_0) with a pooled odds ratio for HIV infection of 13_5 (95% CI 10_0-18_1) with wide intraregional ranges in the pooled HIV prevalence and odds ratios for HIV infection. In 26 countries with medium and high background HIV prevalence, 30_7% (95% CI 30_2-31_3; 8627 of 28,075) of sex workers were HIV-positive and the odds ratio for infection was 11_6 (95% CI 9_1-14_8). INTERPRETATION: Although data characterising HIV risk among female sex workers is scarce, the burden of disease is disproportionately high. These data suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV prevention programmes. Considerations of the legal and policy environments in which sex workers operate and actions to address the important role of stigma, discrimination, and violence targeting female sex workers is needed.

1421,"A high throughput, functional screen of human Body Mass Index GWAS loci using tissue-specific RNAi Drosophila melanogaster crosses Human GWAS of obesity have been successful in identifying loci associated with adiposity, but for the most part, these are non-coding SNPs whose function, or even whose gene of action, is unknown. To help identify the genes on which these human BMI loci may be operating, we conducted a high throughput screen in Drosophila melanogaster. Starting with 78 BMI loci from two recently published GWAS meta-analyses, we identified fly orthologs of all nearby genes (_ 250KB). We crossed RNAi knockdown lines of each gene with flies containing tissue-specific drivers to knock down (KD) the expression of the genes only in the brain and the fat body. We then raised the flies on a control diet and compared the amount of fat/triglyceride in the tissue-specific KD group compared to the driver-only control flies. 16 of the 78 BMI GWAS loci could not be screened with this approach, as no gene in the 500-kb region had a fly ortholog. Of the remaining 62 GWAS loci testable in the fly, we found a significant fat phenotype in the KD flies for at least one gene for 26 loci (42%) even after correcting for multiple comparisons. By contrast, the rate of significant fat phenotypes in RNAi KD found in a recent genome-wide Drosophila screen (Pospisilik et al. (2010) is ~5%. More interestingly, for 10 of the 26 positive regions, we found that the nearest gene was not the one that showed a significant phenotype in the fly. Specifically, our screen suggests that for the 10 human BMI SNPs rs11057405, rs205262, rs9925964, rs9914578, rs2287019, rs11688816, rs13107325, rs7164727, rs17724992, and rs299412, the functional genes may NOT be the nearest ones (CLIP1, C6orf106, KAT8, SMG6, QPCTL, EHBP1, SLC39A8, ADPGK /ADPGK-AS1, PGPEP1, KCTD15, respectively), but instead, the specific nearby cis genes are the functional target (namely: ZCCHC8, VPS33A, RSRC2; SPDEF, NUDT3; PAGR1; SETD1, VKORC1; SGSM2, SRR; VASP, SIX5; OTX1; BANK1; ARIH1; ELL; CHST8, respectively). The study also suggests further functional experiments to elucidate mechanism of action for genes evolutionarily conserved for fat storage.",,,8,,,
1422,"Tobacco harms, nicotine pharmacology, and pharmacologic tobacco cessation interventions for women Firsthand and secondhand tobacco use is linked to a multitude of harmful illnesses, adverse perinatal outcomes, and death. Cessation attempts among women may be hampered by their unique biologic response to nicotine. Current research has revealed epigenetic changes from intrauterine nicotine exposure that have intergenerational consequences. Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various pharmacologic tobacco cessation interventions in conjunction with behavioral counseling. Based on this evidence, the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2015 guideline recommends pharmacologic therapy for all nonpregnant persons who smoke in addition to behavioral counseling. The effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments among pregnant women is less clear, with far fewer studies evaluating potential benefits and harms. While exposure to pharmacologic therapies raises concerns for fetal safety, these potential risks must be weighed against those of continued tobacco use, which guarantees fetal exposure to nicotine. First-line tobacco cessation medications include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Second-line medications include nortriptyline and clonidine. Pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, regimens, and safety profiles for nonpregnant, pregnant, and lactating women are reviewed. Alternative tobacco cessation options and potential new pharmacologic tobacco cessation agents are discussed. Initiating brief interventions, using the 5A's and 5R's model is described. _ 2017 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.",,,5,,,
1423,"Genome-wide association analysis of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in African Americans: a short report African Americans have the highest rate of mortality due to coronary heart disease (CHD). Although multiple loci have been identified influencing CHD risk in European-Americans using a genome-wide association (GWAS) approach, no GWAS of incident CHD has been reported for African Americans. We performed a GWAS for incident CHD events collected during 19 years of follow-up in 2,905 African Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We identified a genome-wide significant SNP (rs1859023, MAF = 31%) located at 7q21 near the PFTK1 gene (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69, p = 1.86_10(-08)), which replicated in an independent sample of over 8,000 African American women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.93, p = 0.005).

1424,"Who presents satisfied? Non-modifiable factors associated with patient satisfaction among gynecologic oncology clinic patients OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between non-modifiable patient factors and patient satisfaction (PS) among women presenting to a gynecologic oncology clinic. METHODS: This is a cross sectional analysis of patients presenting for surgical management by a gynecologic oncologist at a tertiary care academic medical center. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18) that measures PS in seven domains of health care was administered. Scores were converted to ""satisfied"" versus ""unsatisfied/equivocal"". Demographic and medical factors were obtained from the medical record. Chi-square, t-tests, and multivariable logistic regression were used. RESULTS: 208 patients completed the baseline patient satisfaction questionnaire and the median PSQ-18 score was 70.5 (range: 42-90). Median age was 58years (range: 22-93). Several non-modifiable factors were associated with PS. White patients had higher interpersonal PS than minorities (86% v 65%, p=0.002). The uninsured had lower interpersonal (60% v 86%, p=0.003) and accessibility PS (33% v 67%, p=0.03). Increasing education and less time travelled to care were both associated with higher interpersonal (p=0.03, p=0.05) and accessibility PS (p=0.01, p=0.01). There was no association between clinical factors (BMI, comorbidities, cancer) and PS. In multivariable analysis, the strongest predictor of interpersonal PS was white race while the strongest predictors of accessibility PS were time travelled to care and insurance status. CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction scores among patients presenting to a gynecologic oncology clinic are associated with non-modifiable demographic, financial and geographic factors. Pay for performance measures that use summed patient satisfaction scores may penalize hospitals for patient-mix driven differences. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,3,,,
1425,"Meeting physical activity guidelines and the risk of incident knee osteoarthritis: a population-based prospective cohort study OBJECTIVE: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability and joint pain. Although other risk factors of knee OA have been identified, how physical activity affects incident knee OA remains unclear. METHODS: Using data from the first (1999-2004) and second (2005-2010) followup periods of the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project study, we tested the association between meeting physical activity guidelines and incident knee outcomes among 1,522 adults ages _45 years. The median followup time was 6.5 years (range 4.0-10.2 years). Physical activity at baseline (moderate-equivalent physical activity minutes/week) was calculated using the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity questionnaire. Incident knee radiographic OA (ROA) was defined as the development of Kellgren/Lawrence grade _2 in a knee at followup. Incident knee symptomatic ROA (sROA) was defined as the development of ROA and symptoms in at least 1 knee at followup. Weibull regression modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for interval-censored data. RESULTS: In multivariable models, meeting the 2008 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) physical activity guidelines (_150 minutes/week) was not significantly associated with ROA (HR 1.20 [95% CI 0.92-1.56]) or sROA (HR 1.24 [95% CI 0.87-1.76]). Adults in the highest level (_300 minutes/week) of physical activity had a higher risk of knee ROA and sROA compared with inactive (0 to < 10 minutes/week) participants; however, these associations were not statistically significant (HR 1.62 [95% CI 0.97-2.68] and HR 1.42 [95% CI 0.76-2.65], respectively). CONCLUSION: Meeting the HHS physical activity guidelines was not associated with incident knee ROA or sROA in a cohort of middle-aged and older adults.

1426,"Bone mineral density and the risk of hip and knee osteoarthritis: the johnston county osteoarthritis project OBJECTIVE: To address knowledge gaps regarding the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and incident hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA); specifically, lack of information regarding hip OA or symptomatic outcomes. METHODS: Using data (n = 1,474) from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project's first (1999-2004) and second (2005-2010) followup of participants ages _45 years, we examined the association between total hip BMD and both hip and knee OA. Total hip BMD was measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry, and participants were classified into sex-specific quartiles (low, intermediate low, intermediate high, and high). Radiographic OA (ROA) was defined as development of Kellgren/Lawrence grade _2. Symptomatic ROA (sROA) was defined as onset of both ROA and symptoms. Weibull regression modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Median followup time was 6.5 years (range 4.0-10.2 years). In multivariate models, and compared with participants with low BMD, those with intermediate high and high BMD were less likely to develop hip sROA (HR 0.52 [95% CI 0.31-0.86] and 0.56 [95% CI 0.31-0.86], respectively; P = 0.024 for trend); high BMD was not associated (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.45-1.06]) with risk of hip ROA. Compared with participants with low BMD, those with intermediate low and intermediate high total hip BMD were more likely to develop knee sROA (HR 2.15 [95% CI 1.40-3.30] and 1.65 [95% CI 1.02-2.67], respectively; P = 0.325 for trend); similar associations were seen with knee ROA. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that higher BMD may reduce the risk of hip sROA, while intermediate levels may increase the risk of both knee sROA and ROA. _ 2017, American College of Rheumatology.",,,9,,,
1427,"Availability of family planning services and quality of counseling by faith-based organizations: a three country comparative analysis BACKGROUND: Faith-based organizations (FBOs) have a long history of providing health services in developing countries and are important contributors to healthcare systems. Support for the wellbeing of women, children, and families is evidenced through active participation in the field of family planning (FP). However, there is little quantitative evidence on the availability or quality of FP services by FBOs. METHODS: The descriptive analysis uses facility-level data collected through recent Service Provision Assessments in Malawi (2013-14), Kenya (2010), and Haiti (2012) to examine 11 indicators of FP service and method availability and nine indicators of comprehensive and quality counseling. The indicators include measures of FP service provision, method mix, method stock, the provision of accurate information, and the discussion of reproductive intentions, client's questions/concerns, prevention of sexually transmitted infections, and return visits, among others. Pearson's Chi-square test is used to assess the selected indicators by managing authority (FBO, public, and other private sector) to determine statistical equivalence. RESULTS: Results show that FBOs are less likely to offer FP services than other managing authorities (p_< _0.05). For example, 69% of FBOs in Kenya offer FP services compared to 97% of public facilities and 83% of other private facilities. Offering long-acting or permanent methods in faith-based facilities is especially low (43% in Malawi, 29% in Kenya and 39% in Haiti). There were few statistically significant differences between the managing authorities in comprehensive and quality counseling indicators. Interestingly, Haitian FBOs often perform as well or better than public sector health facilities on counseling indicators, such as discussion of a return visit (79% of FBO providers vs. 68% of public sector providers) and discussion of client concerns/questions (52% vs. 49%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this analysis indicate that there is room for improvement in the availability of FP services by FBOs in these countries. Quality of counseling should be improved by all managing authorities in the three countries, as indicated by low overall coverage for practices such as ensuring confidentiality (22% in Malawi, 47% in Kenya and 12% in Haiti), discussion of sexually transmitted infections (18%, 25%, 17%, respectively), and providing services to youth (53%, 27%, 32%, respectively).",,,1,,,
1428,"Evaluation of mainstreaming youth-friendly health in private clinics in Malawi BACKGROUND: High fertility rates and low modern contraceptive use put African youth and adolescents at high risk for health complications, including maternal mortality. Mainstreaming youth-friendly health services (YFHS) into existing services is one approach to improve access to reproductive health services for youth and adolescents. The objective of the evaluation was to assess the effects of a Population Services International (PSI)-sponsored YFHS training package on voluntary uptake of family planning among youth and perceptions of service quality by youth and trained healthcare providers in Malawi. METHODS: In 2018, a mixed-methods convergent parallel design was used to assess relevant monitoring and evaluation documents and service statistics from PSI Malawi and qualitative data on perceptions of service quality from Malawian youth and healthcare providers. The data were assessed through separate descriptive and thematic analysis and integrated to generate conclusions. RESULTS: Results show that the number of family planning clients ages 15-24 increased from 72 to 2278 per quarter during the implementation of the YFHS training packages, however, positive trends in client numbers were not sustained after youth outreach activities ended. Focus group discussions with 70 youth and adolescents indicated that clinics were perceived as providing high-quality services to youth. The main barriers to accessing the services were cost and embarrassment. Interviews with ten healthcare providers indicated that many made efforts to improve clinic accessibility and understood the barrier of cost and importance of outreach to youth and the broader community. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support research showing positive effects of mainstreaming YFHS when training for healthcare staff is combined with additional YFHS programming components. Furthermore, the findings provide evidence that provider training alone, though beneficial to perceived service quality, is not sufficient to sustain increases in the number of adolescent and youth family planning clients.",,,4,,,
1429,"What differentiates method stoppers from switchers? Contraceptive discontinuation and switching among Honduran women CONTEXT: Contraceptive discontinuation contributes to unplanned pregnancy and unwanted births, as well as increased maternal, neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality. Information on differences between women who stop using contraceptives and those who switch to another method would be useful for programs aimed at preventing unplanned pregnancies and their consequences. METHODS: Data come from two rounds of interviews with women aged 15-44 (800 interviewed at baseline and 671 reinterviewed one year later) who were new or continuing users of injectable or oral contraceptives or an IUD. Bivariate analysis examined associations between attitudes and behaviors of women who discontinued their baseline method and side effects they experienced. Multivariate logistic regression assessed differences between women who switched methods immediately or within one month of discontinuation and those who stopped contraceptive use for one month or more. RESULTS: Of the 671 women who were reinterviewed, 41% (273) discontinued use of their baseline contraceptive method within the one-year follow-up; of those, 43% (117) switched to a new method, and 57% (156) stopped for one month or more. Seeking help with side effects from a health worker, urban residence, talking to a partner about the decision to discontinue, and new and recent method adoption were associated with increased odds of switching methods (odds ratios, 2.0-3.5). CONCLUSION: Access to high-quality family planning services and encouraging discussion with partners and families before stopping contraceptive use is important for women who experience side effects from contraceptive methods and are at risk of discontinuation.",,,2,,,
1430,"Women's contraceptive discontinuation and switching behavior in urban Senegal, 2010-2015 BACKGROUND: With the focus of global and national family planning initiatives on reaching ""additional user"" targets, it is increasingly important for programs to assess contraceptive method discontinuation and switching. This analysis calculated the discontinuation rate and method-specific discontinuation rates, examined reasons given for contraceptive discontinuation, and assessed characteristics associated with subsequent contraceptive switching and abandonment among women living in urban areas of Senegal. METHODS: Data came from the Measurement, Learning & Evaluation project's 2015 survey of 6927 women of reproductive age living in six urban sites (Dakar, Pikine, Gu_diawaye, Mbao, Kaolack and Mbour). Information on contraceptive use and discontinuation for the five years preceding the survey were recorded in a monthly calendar. Single decrement life tables were used to calculate discontinuation rates. Descriptive analyses were used to assess reasons for discontinuation and method switching after discontinuation. A multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of being a non-user in-need of contraception, a non-user not in-need of contraception, or a method switcher in the month after discontinuation, by sociodemographic and other characteristics. RESULTS: The 12-month discontinuation rate for all methods was 34.7%. Implants had the lowest one-year discontinuation rates (6.3%) followed by the intrauterine device (IUD) (18.4%) while higher rates were seen for daily pills (38%), injectables (32.7%), and condoms (62.9%). The most common reasons for discontinuation were reduced need (45.6%), method problems (30.1%), and becoming pregnant while using (10.0%). Only 17% of discontinuations were followed by use of another method; most often daily pills (5.2%) or injectables (4.2%). In the multivariate analysis, women with any formal education (primary, secondary or higher) were more than 50% more likely to switch methods than remain in need of contraception after discontinuation than women with no education or Koranic-only education (RRR_=_1.59, p-value_=_0.004; RRR_=_1.55, p-value_=_0.031). The likelihood of switching compared to being ""in need"" was also significantly higher for women who were married and who discontinued traditional methods. CONCLUSIONS: To support increased contraceptive method use, women with no education and unmarried women are priorities for counseling and information about side effects and method switching at the time of method adoption.",,,3,,,
1431,"Understanding patterns of temporary method use among urban women from Uttar Pradesh, India BACKGROUND: Almost one in five contraceptive users in India uses a temporary method. It is important to understand user profiles and method use patterns for optimal program targeting.This analysis examines differences in demographic characteristics, discontinuation and use patterns of temporary method users among a representative sample of urban women from four cities in Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS: Individual data from a panel of women aged 15-49 were collected in 2010 in Agra, Aligarh, Allahabad, and Gorakhpur and follow-up data from the same women were collected in 2012. A contraceptive calendar was used to collect month-by-month data on contraceptive use, non-use, discontinuation, reason for discontinuation, and pregnancy and birth, covering the approximately two-year period between the baseline and midterm surveys. The analysis sample is 4,023 non-sterilized women in union at baseline. A descriptive comparison is made of socio-demographic characteristics, fertility desires, discontinuation, method switching, and pregnancy outcomes. Reasons for discontinuation are assessed by the order of discontinuation. RESULTS: There were a number of socio-demographic differences between users of temporary methods during the calendar period; by education, wealth, and caste. Notably, women who used only condoms during this time had the most education, were the least likely to be poor, and the least likely to be from a scheduled caste or tribe as compared to users of other temporary methods. Compared to the full sample of women, users of temporary methods during this period were less likely to reside in slum areas. The group of multiple method users was small in comparison to the groups of women using a single method throughout the calendar period. This indicates that there was little method switching between condoms, traditional methods, and other forms of modern methods reported in the calendar. CONCLUSIONS: The calendar may not be well-suited to measure coital-dependent contraceptive use (e.g., condoms and traditional methods), as ""continuous"" monthly use may be overstated. A coital episode-specific data collection tool may produce more accurate records of contraceptive use in such contexts. Research findings also lead to useful programmatic recommendations for addressing unmet need and unintended pregnancies in urban Uttar Pradesh and beyond.",,,6,,,
1432,"Contraceptive discontinuation among Honduran women who use reversible methods A panel study examining the effects of women's individual characteristics, side effects experienced, and service quality on their contraceptive discontinuation was undertaken in four urban areas of Honduras. Data were collected from October 2006 to December 2007. The baseline sample consisted of 800 women aged 15-44 who were new or continuing users of an injectable contraceptive, the IUD, or an oral contraceptive. A total of 671 women (84 percent) were reinterviewed after one year. Life tables and Cox proportional hazards models were used to present discontinuation rates and factors associated with contraceptive discontinuation. Among new users, discontinuation of the baseline method at 12 months was high (45 percent), especially for users of an injectable method (50 percent). In the hazards model, service quality had little effect on discontinuation, whereas individual characteristics and the experience of specific side effects showed significant effects. The results suggest that programs should emphasize continuous contraceptive coverage rather than continuous use of a particular method.",,,3,,,

1434,"Next-Generation High-Throughput Functional Annotation of Microbial Genomes Host infection by microbial pathogens cues global changes in microbial and host cell biology that facilitate microbial replication and disease. The complete maps of thousands of bacterial and viral genomes have recently been defined; however, the rate at which physiological or biochemical functions have been assigned to genes has greatly lagged. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) addressed this gap by creating functional genomics centers dedicated to developing high-throughput approaches to assign gene function. These centers require broad-based and collaborative research programs to generate and integrate diverse data to achieve a comprehensive understanding of microbial pathogenesis. High-throughput functional genomics can lead to new therapeutics and better understanding of the next generation of emerging pathogens by rapidly defining new general mechanisms by which organisms cause disease and replicate in host tissues and by facilitating the rate at which functional data reach the scientific community.

1435,"Effect of a Behavioral Intervention for Underserved Preschool-Age Children on Change in Body Mass Index: A Randomized Clinical Trial Importance: Prevention of obesity during childhood is critical for children in underserved populations, for whom obesity prevalence and risk of chronic disease are highest. Objective: To test the effect of a multicomponent behavioral intervention on child body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) growth trajectories over 36 months among preschool-age children at risk for obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial assigned 610 parent-child pairs from underserved communities in Nashville, Tennessee, to a 36-month intervention targeting health behaviors or a school-readiness control. Eligible children were between ages 3 and 5 years and at risk for obesity but not yet obese. Enrollment occurred from August 2012 to May 2014; 36-month follow-up occurred from October 2015 to June 2017. Interventions: The intervention (n_=_304 pairs) was a 36-month family-based, community-centered program, consisting of 12 weekly skills-building sessions, followed by monthly coaching telephone calls for 9 months, and a 24-month sustainability phase providing cues to action. The control (n_=_306 pairs) consisted of 6 school-readiness sessions delivered over the 36-month study, conducted by the Nashville Public Library. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was child BMI trajectory over 36 months. Seven prespecified secondary outcomes included parent-reported child dietary intake and community center use. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: Participants were predominantly Latino (91.4%). At baseline, the mean (SD) child age was 4.3 (0.9) years; 51.9% were female. Household income was below $25_000 for 56.7% of families. Retention was 90.2%. At 36 months, the mean (SD) child BMI was 17.8 (2.2) in the intervention group and 17.8 (2.1) in the control group. No significant difference existed in the primary outcome of BMI trajectory over 36 months (P_=_.39). The intervention group children had a lower mean caloric intake (1227 kcal/d) compared with control group children (1323 kcal/d) (adjusted difference, -99.4 kcal [95% CI, -160.7 to -38.0]; corrected P_=_.003). Intervention group parents used community centers with their children more than control group parents (56.8% in intervention; 44.4% in control) (risk ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.53]; corrected P_=_.006). Conclusions and Relevance: A 36-month multicomponent behavioral intervention did not change BMI trajectory among underserved preschool-age children in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with a control program. Whether there would be effectiveness for other types of behavioral interventions or implementation in other cities would require further research.

1436,"Parent's physical activity associated with preschooler activity in underserved populations INTRODUCTION: In the U.S., children from low-income families are more likely to be obese. The impact of parent modeling of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors in low-income American ethnic minorities is unclear, and studies examining objective measures of preschooler and parent PA are sparse. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 1,003 parent-child pairs who were of low income, largely Latino and African American, and living in one of two geographically disparate metropolitan areas in the U.S. Parents and children wore GT3X/GT3X+ accelerometers for an average of >12 hours/day (7:00am-9:00pm) for 1 week (September 2012 to May 2014). Analysis occurred in 2015-2016. RESULTS: About 75% of children were Latino and >10% were African American. Mean child age was 3.9 years. The majority of children (60%) were normal weight (BMI _50th and < 85th percentiles), and more than a third were overweight/obese. Children's total PA was 6.03 hours/day, with 1.5 hours spent in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Covariate-adjusted models showed a monotonic, positive association between parent and child minutes of sedentary behavior (_=0.10, 95% CI=0.06, 0.15) and light PA (_=0.06; 95% CI=0.03, 0.09). Child and parent MVPA were positively associated up to 40 minutes/day of parent MVPA, but an inverse association was observed when parental MVPA was beyond 40 minutes/day (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing parental PA and reducing sedentary behavior correlate with increased PA-related behaviors in children. However, more work is needed to understand the impact of high levels of parental MVPA on the MVPA levels of their children. Copyright _ 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

1437,"Lack of difference in treatment patterns and clinical outcomes between black and white patients with inflammatory bowel disease Background: Previous reports have shown differences in phenotypes among black patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with other racial groups, but prior studies were limited by small numbers of black patients and cross-sectional analyses. We used data from the Sinai-Helmsley Alliance for Research Excellence cohort to compare phenotypes and treatment patterns of black and white patients with IBD in a prospective study. Methods: We compared phenotypes, IBD-specific therapies, and health care utilization among black and white patients with IBD. For all analyses, we performed bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Results: Among 5537 patients with IBD, 314 (6%) reported black race. Black patients were more likely to report a Crohn's disease (CD)-related complication at baseline (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.95). Black patients with CD were more likely to develop a new abscess (aOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.31-3.93) and initiate an anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy during follow-up (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.09-3.14). Black patients with ulcerative colitis were more likely to have proctitis (24% vs 13%, P = 0.033) at baseline. There were no differences in surgery or hospitalization rates during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Black patients with CD demonstrated increased complications at baseline and during follow-up in this cohort.

1438,"High patient activation is associated with remission in patients with inflammatory bowel disease BACKGROUND: High levels of patient activation (having the knowledge, skills, and confidence to effectively manage one's care), have been associated with improved outcomes in many chronic conditions. There have been few studies of the effects of activation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a large, prospective Internet-based study to assess the relationship between patient activation level and clinical remission in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. METHODS: We administered the Patient Activation Measure (Insignia Health) to 1486 cohort participants. Patients completed a follow-up survey within 13 months (median, 189 days). We collected demographic and clinical data; anxiety and depression were assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System instruments. We used bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with low or high patient activation and to evaluate the association between levels of patient activation and subsequent disease activity. RESULTS: Higher anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.36) and depression (aOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.29-0.37) scores were associated with a decreased odds of high patient activation. After we adjusted for education status, smoking, medication use, and other confounders, we found that patients with high activation at baseline were more likely to be in clinical remission during the follow-up period (aOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.20-2.45). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, prospective Internet-based cohort of patients with IBD, we found a strong association between patient activation and clinical remission. These findings suggest that patient activation affects disease outcomes. _ 2018 Crohn__ & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

1439,"Cytomegalovirus infection and risk of Alzheimer disease in older black and white individuals BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is prevalent in older adults and has been implicated in many chronic diseases of aging. This study investigated the relation between CMV and the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Data come from 3 cohort studies that included 849 participants (mean age [_SD], 78.6 _ 7.2 years; mean education duration [_SD], 15.4 _ 3.3 years; 25% black). RESULTS: A solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for detecting type-specific immunoglobulin G antibody responses to CMV and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) measured in archived serum samples. Of 849 participants, 73.4% had serologic evidence of exposure to CMV (89.0% black and 68.2% white; P < .001). During an average of 5.0 years of follow-up, 93 persons developed AD. CMV seropositivity was associated with an increased risk of AD (relative risk, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-3.27) and a faster rate of decline in global cognition (estimate [_standard error], -0.02 _ 0.01; P = .03) in models that controlled for age, sex, education duration, race, vascular risk factors, vascular diseases, and apolipoprotein _4 level. Results were similar in black and white individuals for both incident AD and change in cognitive function and were independent of HSV-1 status. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CMV infection is associated with an increased risk of AD and a faster rate of cognitive decline in older diverse populations. _ The Author 2014.

1440,"Image-guided optimization of the ECG trace in cardiac MRI Improper electrocardiogram (ECG) lead placement resulting in suboptimal gating may lead to reduced image quality in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). A patientspecific systematic technique for rapid optimization of lead placement may improve CMR image quality. A rapid 3 dimensional image of the thorax was used to guide the realignment of ECG leads relative to the cardiac axis of the patient in forty consecutive adult patients. Using our novel approach and consensus reading of pre- and post-correction ECG traces, seventy-three percent of patients had a qualitative improvement in their ECG tracings, and no patient had a decrease in quality of their ECG tracing following the correction technique. Statistically significant improvement was observed independent of gender, body mass index, and cardiac rhythm. This technique provides an efficient option to improve the quality of the ECG tracing in patients who have a poor quality ECG with standard techniques.",,,1,,,

1442,"Promoting integrated approaches to reducing health inequities among low-income workers: applying a social ecological framework BACKGROUND: Nearly one of every three workers in the United States is low-income. Low-income populations have a lower life expectancy and greater rates of chronic diseases compared to those with higher incomes. Low- income workers face hazards in their workplaces as well as in their communities. Developing integrated public health programs that address these combined health hazards, especially the interaction of occupational and non-occupational risk factors, can promote greater health equity. METHODS: We apply a social-ecological perspective in considering ways to improve the health of the low-income working population through integrated health protection and health promotion programs initiated in four different settings: the worksite, state and local health departments, community health centers, and community-based organizations. RESULTS: Examples of successful approaches to developing integrated programs are presented in each of these settings. These examples illustrate several complementary venues for public health programs that consider the complex interplay between work-related and non work-related factors, that integrate health protection with health promotion and that are delivered at multiple levels to improve health for low-income workers. CONCLUSIONS: Whether at the workplace or in the community, employers, workers, labor and community advocates, in partnership with public health practitioners, can deliver comprehensive and integrated health protection and health promotion programs. Recommendations for improved research, training, and coordination among health departments, health practitioners, worksites and community organizations are proposed. _ 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,2,,,
1443,"Caloric beverage consumption patterns in Mexican children BACKGROUND: Mexico has seen a very steep increase in child obesity level. Little is known about caloric beverage intake in this country as well as all other countries outside a few high income countries. This study examines overall patterns and trends in all caloric beverages from two nationally representative surveys from Mexico. METHODS: The two nationally representative dietary intake surveys (1999 and 2006) from Mexico are used to study caloric beverage intake in 17, 215 children. The volume (ml) and caloric energy (kcal) contributed by all beverages consumed by the sample subjects were measured. Results are weighted to be nationally representative. RESULTS: The trends from the dietary intake surveys showed very large increases in caloric beverages among pre-school and school children. The contribution of whole milk and sugar-sweetened juices was an important finding. Mexican pre-school children consumed 27.8% of their energy from caloric beverages in 2006 and school children consumed 20.7% of their energy from caloric beverages during the same time. The three major categories of beverage intake are whole milk, fruit juice with various sugar and water combinations and carbonated and noncarbonated sugared-beverages. CONCLUSION: The Mexican government, greatly concerned about obesity, has identified the large increase in caloric beverages from whole milk, juices and soft drinks as a key target and is initiating major changes to address this problem. They have already used the data to shift 20 million persons in their welfare and feeding programs from whole to 1.5% fat milk and in a year will shift to nonfat milk. They are using these data to revise school beverage policies and national regulations and taxation policies related to an array of less healthful caloric beverages.",,,4,,,
1444,"Prevalence and Work-Related Factors Associated with Lower Back Musculoskeletal Disorders in Female Shellfish Gatherers in Saubara, Bahia-Brazil Lower back musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are an important public health problem and the leading cause of disability worldwide, but with yet unknown prevalence among shellfish gatherers. To investigate the prevalence and work-related factors associated with lower back MSD in a population of female shellfish gatherers, an epidemiological cross-sectional study was carried out in Saubara, Bahia-Brazil, in 2013. The Brazilian version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), in addition to a questionnaire containing the physical demands adapted to the artisanal work, were applied to a random sample of 209 female shellfish gatherers. The prevalence of lower back MSD was 72.7%. Using multivariate logistic regression, the shellfish gatherers who had worked for more than 26 years in the activity showed a prevalence of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04_1.44) times higher compared to those unexposed. Lower back MSD was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.08_1.42) times higher among those more exposed to work sitting with trunk flexion. Those performed manual handling and muscle force with the arms had a prevalence ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01_1.39). These results show the need for greater awareness of health and social welfare factors impacting workers in small-scale fisheries and will promote the elaboration of health care policies for this occupational class.",,,9,,,
1445,"The influence of maternal psychosocial characteristics on infant feeding styles Maternal feeding styles in infancy and early childhood are associated with children's later risk for overweight and obesity. Maternal psychosocial factors that influence feeding styles during the complementary feeding period, the time during which infants transition from a milk-based diet to one that includes solid foods and other non-milk products, have received less attention. The present study explores how maternal psychosocial factors-specifically self-esteem, parenting self-efficacy, parenting satisfaction, and depression symptoms-influence mothers' infant feeding styles at nine months of age, a time during which solid foods eating habits are being established. Participants included 160 low-income, African-American mother-infant pairs in central North Carolina who were enrolled in the Infant Care and Risk of Obesity Study. Regression models tested for associations between maternal psychosocial characteristics and pressuring and restrictive feeding styles. Models were first adjusted for maternal age, education, marital status and obesity status. To account for infant characteristics, models were then adjusted for infant weight-for-length, distress to limitations and activity level scores. Maternal self-esteem was negatively associated with pressuring to soothe. Maternal parenting self-efficacy was positively associated with restriction-diet quality. Maternal parenting satisfaction and depression symptoms were not associated with feeding styles in the final models. Focusing on strengthening maternal self-esteem and parenting self-efficacy may help to prevent the development of less desirable infant feeding styles. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1446,"Contributions of nonmaternal caregivers to infant feeding in a low-income African-American sample Infant feeding is a well-established topic of interest in obesity research, yet few studies have focused on contributions of nonmaternal caregivers (NMCs)-such as fathers, grandparents, and daycare providers-to infant feeding. Data from the Infant Care, Feeding and Risk of Obesity Project in North Carolina were used to investigate (a) which factors were associated with NMC feeding styles and (b) how NMCs' and mothers' feeding styles compared. Multivariate regression models utilizing random effects were used to analyse data from 108 NMCs who were identified by mothers as being heavily involved in infant feeding. Feeding styles were measured using the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire. Several individual characteristics were important. Higher laissez faire-attention scores were reported by men and NMCs who lived in the same household as infant. Men reported higher indulgent-coax and indulgent-pamper scores. Perceptions of fussier infants, older infant age, and higher infant weight-for-length z-scores were also important. Mothers' and NMCs' feeding styles differed. Compared with mothers, grandparents reported lower laissez faire and indulgent-permissive scores. Fathers reported higher pressure-soothe and indulgent scores. Daycare providers reported higher restriction-diet quality and responsive satiety. Feeding styles were also predicted to change over time for all caregiver types. These findings highlight the importance of helping all caregivers develop skills that will promote optimal infant feeding outcomes. Given the paucity of research in this area, it is important to improve our understanding of what influences caregivers' feeding styles, especially among diverse populations, and how exposure to different feeding styles may shape children's obesity risk. _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,1,,,

1448,"'HIV and work don't go together': Employment as a social determinant of HIV outcomes among men who have sex with men and transgender women in the Dominican Republic Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women are disproportionately affected by HIV in the Dominican Republic. Little is known about their experiences living with HIV as a chronic condition. We explored employment as a social determinant of well-being with HIV. We conducted 42 qualitative in-depth interviews with MSM (n_=_16) and transgender women (n_=_5) living with HIV; each participant completed 2 interviews to facilitate depth and iterative analysis. We used narrative analysis and systematic coding to identify salient themes related to employment and the HIV experience and developed a conceptual model of the pathways between HIV stigma, unemployment, and HIV outcomes. Early life experiences, including rejection from families and school, resulted in limited work opportunities, especially among transgender women. Following HIV diagnosis, participants across all socio-economic levels lost jobs and/or were unable to get jobs due to illegal HIV testing and HIV stigma and discrimination. Not being able to work impacted mental health, engagement in HIV care, and overall well-being. We conclude that lack of employment is a salient concern among MSM and transgender women living with HIV. Holistic, multi-level programmes that address illegal HIV testing and discriminatory hiring practices are urgently needed to facilitate engagement in care and long-term well-being.",,,6,,,
1449,"Intersectionalities and the HIV continuum of care among gay Latino men living with HIV in North Carolina OBJECTIVE: Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV in the US and only half of Latinos diagnosed with HIV are virally suppressed. Little is known about the determinants of HIV care and treatment outcomes among Latinos. We used theories of intersectionality to assess the HIV testing, care and treatment experiences of gay Latino men living with HIV in a new immigrant destination. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with US and foreign-born gay Latino men living with HIV (n_=_14) recruited through referrals from HIV care providers and case managers. We used Maxwell and Miller's theory of qualitative analysis to guide our approach to data analysis, integrating narrative techniques and thematic coding. We used theories of intersectionality - including both intersecting identities and structures - as an interpretive framework to understand participants' outcomes and experiences. RESULTS: All participants were engaged in HIV care at the time of the interviews. The mental health burden of diagnosis and managing life with HIV was a salient theme across all interviews. Most participants had experienced interruptions in their care due to both intersecting stigmatized identities (e.g. being gay, Latino, undocumented) and intersecting structures (healthcare, immigration policy, institutionalized homophobia). Undocumented participants directly connected their immigration status to their ability to get work, which then affected their retention in HIV care and treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Examining the interplay between identities and structures provides a contextualized understanding of outcomes along the HIV care continuum among gay Latino men that goes beyond behavioral and cultural explanations. There is a need to assess long-term experiences of navigating HIV care and treatment given the intersecting structures of mobility, housing instability, and immigration policy.",,,6,,,
1450,"Social networks, migration, and HIV testing among Latinos in a_new immigrant destination: Insights from a qualitative study Latinos in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by HIV and are more likely than non-Latinos to present with a late diagnosis, which delays engagement in HIV care and treatment. Social networks may provide normative influence and social support for HIV testing, but a contextualised understanding of networks is needed in order to maximise these social resources. We conducted qualitative interviews with foreign-born Latino men and transgender women (n_=_17) in a new immigrant destination to explore their social networks. Most participants described having smaller social networks after migrating. Networks included both local and transnational ties, but most participants had few close ties. Contextual factors including stigma and geographic dispersion limited the re-construction of networks with close ties after migration. HIV testing was not a common topic of discussion with social network ties. Efforts to improve early uptake of HIV testing among Latino immigrants may benefit from engaging with social networks, but such efforts need to address how the context in which networks operate enables access to testing.",,,2,,,
1451,"Debe cuidarse en la calle: normative influences on condom use among the steady male partners of female sex workers in the Dominican Republic Encouragement to use condoms reflects the injunctive norm, or idea that you should use condoms. In our previous research with the regular male partners of female sex workers, in the Dominican Republic, we found that encouragement to use condoms with female sex workers from individuals in their personal social networks was not directly associated with condom use. In the current study, we used qualitative interviews to further explore the influence of social network norms on men's sexual-risk behaviours. We interviewed 11 steady male partners of female sex workers, with participants completing two interviews to achieve greater depth. We analysed data using analytic summaries and systematic thematic coding. All men perceived that the prevailing injunctive norm was that they should use condoms with sex workers. Men received encouragement to use condoms but did not articulate a link between this encouragement and condom use. Additionally, men who did not use condoms lied to their friends to avoid social sanction. Findings highlight that the influence of a pro-condom injunctive norm is not always health promoting and can even be negative. HIV-prevention efforts seeking to promote condom use should address the alignment between injunctive and descriptive norms to strengthen their collective influence on behaviour.",,,2,,,

We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 26 MSM and transgender women living with HIV in Guatemala City. HIV diagnosis experiences changed over time with increasing asymptomatic testing at non-governmental organizations. Fear of the physical and social impacts of HIV delayed testing, acceptance of diagnosis, and linkage to HIV care. These fears were driven by layered stigma and discrimination due to non-normative gender expressions and / or sexual orientation. Retention-specific determinants included HIV clinic dynamics and limited employment opportunities. There is an urgent need to improve support systems for early testing and linkage to care and to expand employment opportunities. Stigma and discrimination must be addressed at the family, clinic and contextual levels to reduce fear of diagnosis and improve access to care.",,,6,,,

1454,"Using Photo-Elicitation Methods to Understand Resilience Among Ultra-Poor Youth and Their Caregivers in Malawi Unconditional cash transfer programs are a form of structural intervention to address poverty, a ""fundamental cause"" of disease. Such programs increasingly aim to build resilience to sustain improved outcomes and provide a solid foundation for longer term transformations. As such, there is a need to understand what resilience means in specific contexts. The goal of this formative study was to explore local experiences of resilience and vulnerability among 11 youth-caregiver dyads ( n = 22) who were beneficiaries of the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Program in Balaka district. We used a photo-elicitation approach informed by the participatory, visual methodology photovoice to guide the study and conducted an iterative content analysis using thematic coding of transcripts and photos. Participants took pictures of their daily struggles and shocks and participated in audio-recorded discussions to reflect on the photos using an adapted version of the SHOWeD method. We found that participants characterized resilience as a tireless process of using all available individual, family, and community resources at all times in pursuit of survival and well-being. In the context of daily struggles, resilience was an essential part of survival. Shocks, mostly health-related, were depicted through staged images candidly highlighting individual and environmental vulnerabilities. Community support was an essential component of resilience for both daily struggles and shocks. Using photo-elicitation methods facilitated an intergenerational, community-driven reflection on the meaning of resilience and the multilevel determinants of health in a context of extreme poverty. Findings can inform the design of resilience-focused cash transfer programs to improve health equity.",,,4,,,

1457,"Epigenetic reprogramming in periodontal disease: Dynamic crosstalk with potential impact in oncogenesis Periodontitis is a chronic multifactorial in__mmatory disease associated with microbial dysbiosis and characterized by progressive destruction of the periodontal tissues. Such chronic infectious inflammatory disease is recognized as a major public health problem worldwide with measurable impact in systemic health. It has become evident that the periodontal disease phenotypes are not only determined by the microbiome effect, but the extent of the tissue response is also driven by the host genome and epigenome patterns responding to various environmental exposures. More recently there is mounting evidence indicating that epigenetic reprogramming in response to combined intrinsic and environmental exposures, might be particularly relevant due its plasticity and potential application towards precision health. The complex epigenetic crosstalk is reflected in the prognosis and progress of periodontal diseases and may also lead to a favorable landscape for cancer development. This review discusses epigenomics modifications focusing on the role of DNA methylation and pathways linking microbial infection and inflammatory pathways, which are also associated with carcinogenesis. There is a more clear vision whereas 'omics' technologies applied to unveil relevant epigenetic factors could play a significant role in the treatment of periodontal disease in a personalized mode, evidencing that public health approach should coexist with precision individualized treatment. _ 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1458,"Targeting epigenetic mechanisms in periodontal diseases Epigenetic factors are heritable genome modifications that potentially impact gene transcription, contributing to disease states. Epigenetic marks play an important role in chronic inflammatory conditions, as observed in periodontal diseases, by allowing microbial persistence or by permitting microbial insult to play a role in the so-called 'hit-and-run' infectious mechanism, leading to lasting pathogen interference with the host genome. Epigenetics also affects the health sciences by providing a dynamic mechanistic framework to explain the way in which environmental and behavioral factors interact with the genome to alter disease risk. In this article we review current knowledge of epigenome regulation in light of the multifactorial nature of periodontal diseases. We discuss epigenetic tagging in identified genes, and consider the potential implications of epigenetic changes on host-microbiome dynamics in chronic inflammatory states and in response to environmental stressors. The most recent advances in genomic technologies have placed us in a position to analyze interaction effects (eg, between periodontal disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus), which can be investigated through epigenome-wide association analysis. Finally, because of the individualized traits of epigenetic biomarkers, pharmacoepigenomic perspectives are also considered as potentially novel therapeutic approaches for improving periodontal disease status. _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We analyzed a population of HIV-infected adults with depression, who were enrolled in a depression treatment trial, to examine the extent to which improvements in depression over time were associated with improvements in HIV-related fatigue. Data for this analysis come from a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of improved depression treatment on antiretroviral adherence. Fatigue was measured using the HIV-Related Fatigue Scale, and depressive symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Participants (n_=_234) were on average nearly 44_years of age and predominantly male, black or African American, and unemployed.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the natural course of fatigue in HIV infection, in a sample (n=128) followed for a three-year period. METHODS: A longitudinal prospective design was used to determine what factors influenced changes in fatigue intensity and fatigue-related impairment of functioning in a community-dwelling sample of HIV-infected individuals. Participants were followed every six months for a three-year period. At each study visit, we collected data on a large number of physiological and psychosocial markers that have been shown to be related to fatigue in HIV-infected people. At three month intervals between study visits, we collected data on fatigue via mailed questionnaires. RESULTS: Fatigue in HIV infection is largely a result of stressful life events, and is closely tied to the anxiety and depression that accompany such events. Fatigue did not remit spontaneously over the course of the study, indicating the need for interventions to ameliorate this debilitating symptom. CONCLUSION: Intervening to help people who are suffering from HIV-related fatigue to deal with stressful life events may help to ameliorate this debilitating symptom.

1461,"A functional role for the cancer disparity-linked genes, CRY_B2 and CRY_B2P1, in the promotion of breast cancer BACKGROUND: In the USA, the breast cancer mortality rate is 41% higher for African-American women than non-Hispanic White women. While numerous gene expression studies have classified biological features that vary by race and may contribute to poorer outcomes, few studies have experimentally tested these associations. CRY_B2 gene expression has drawn particular interest because of its association with overall survival and African-American ethnicity in multiple cancers. Several reports indicate that overexpression of the CRY_B2 pseudogene, CRY_B2P1, and not CRY_B2 is linked with race and poor outcome. It remains unclear whether either or both genes are linked to breast cancer outcomes. This study investigates CRY_B2 and CRY_B2P1 expression in human breast cancers and breast cancer cell line models, with the goal of elucidating the mechanistic contribution of CRY_B2 and CRY_B2P1 to racial disparities. METHODS: Custom scripts for CRY_B2 or CRY_B2P1 were generated and used to identify reads that uniquely aligned to either gene. Gene expression according to race and tumor subtype were assessed using all available TCGA breast cancer RNA sequencing alignment samples (n_=_1221). In addition, triple-negative breast cancer models engineered to have each gene overexpressed or knocked out were developed and evaluated by in vitro, biochemical, and in vivo assays to identify biological functions. RESULTS: We provide evidence that CRY_B2P1 is expressed at higher levels in breast tumors compared to CRY_B2, but only CRY_B2P1 is significantly increased in African-American tumors relative to White American tumors. We show that independent of CRY_B2, CRY_B2P1 enhances tumorigenesis in vivo via promoting cell proliferation. Our data also reveal that CRY_B2P1 may function as a non-coding RNA to regulate CRY_B2 expression. A key observation is that the combined overexpression of both genes was found to suppress cell growth. CRY_B2 overexpression in triple-negative breast cancers increases invasive cellular behaviors, tumor growth, IL6 production, immune cell chemoattraction, and the expression of metastasis-associated genes. These data underscore that both CRY_B2 and CRY_B2P1 promote tumor growth, but their mechanisms for tumor promotion are likely distinct. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel data emphasizing the need to distinguish and study the biological effects of both CRY_B2 and CRY_B2P1 as both genes independently promote tumor progression. Our data demonstrate novel molecular mechanisms of two understudied, disparity-linked molecules.",,,3,,,
1462,"Variants downstream of the ornithine decarboxylase gene influence risk of colorectal adenoma and aspirin chemoprevention Increased mucosal polyamine levels and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity are associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia and aspirin treatment reduces risk. Previous studies suggest that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the ODC gene (rs2302615) may be associated with adenoma risk and/or response to aspirin chemoprevention. However, a comprehensive investigation of common genetic variation in the region of ODC gene is lacking. Using a tag SNP approach, we investigated associations between genotype or haplotype and adenoma risk among a cohort of 792 non-Hispanic white participants in a randomized trial of aspirin. Generalized linear regression was used to compute relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for age and sex. The false discovery rate was used to account for multiple testing. Interactions terms were used to assess whether genotype modified the effect of aspirin treatment. Of 15 SNPs analyzed, seven were statistically significantly associated with adenoma risk. However, in multiple SNP regression models, only two of these, located downstream of the gene, were independently associated with risk: rs11694911 (RR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.08-1.53; P = 0.005) and rs2430420 (RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03-1.40; P = 0.022). In addition, there was evidence that rs2430420 and rs28362380 modified the effect of aspirin treatment, whereas the previously investigated SNP, rs2302615, had no statistically significant main effect or interaction with aspirin treatment. Our findings suggest that common genetic variants located downstream (3') of the ODC gene influence risk of colorectal adenoma and may also impact the efficacy of aspirin chemoprevention. 2011 AACR",,,3,,,

Objective: To investigate whether common variants in 7 vitamin D and calcium pathway genes (VDR, GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, and CASR) modify the effects of vitamin D3 or calcium supplementation on colorectal adenoma recurrence. Design, Setting, and Participants: We examined 41 candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2259 participants in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 11 clinical centers in the United States. Eligibility criteria included a recently diagnosed adenoma and no remaining colorectal polyps after complete colonoscopy. The study's treatment phase ended on August 31, 2013, and the analysis for the present study took place from July 28, 2014, to October 19, 2016. Interventions: Daily oral supplementation with vitamin D3 (1000 IU) or calcium carbonate (1200 mg elemental calcium) or both or neither. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes assessed were the occurrence of 1 or more adenomas or advanced adenomas (estimated diameter, _1 cm; or with villous histologic findings, high-grade dysplasia, or cancer) during follow-up. Treatment effects and genotype associations and interactions were estimated as adjusted risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The effective number of independent SNPs was calculated to correct for multiple testing. Results: Among the 2259 participants randomized, 1702 were non-Hispanic whites who completed the trial and had genotype data for analysis (1101 men; mean [SD] age 58.1 [6.8] years). The effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on advanced adenomas, but not on adenoma risk overall, significantly varied according to genotype at 2 VDR SNPs (rs7968585 and rs731236) in linkage disequilibrium (D'_=_0.98; r2_=_0.6). For rs7968585, among individuals with the AA genotype (26%), vitamin D3 supplementation reduced risk by 64% (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69; P_=_.002; absolute risk decreased from 14.4% to 5.1%). Among individuals with 1 or 2 G alleles (74%), vitamin D3 supplementation increased risk by 41% (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.99-2.00; P_=_.05; absolute risk increased from 7.7% to 11.1%; P_< _.001 for interaction). There were no significant interactions of genotypes with calcium supplementation. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that benefits from vitamin D3 supplementation for the prevention of advanced colorectal adenomas may vary according to vitamin D receptor genotype.

1464,"CYP2C9 variants increase risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence and modify associations with smoking but not aspirin treatment PURPOSE: The cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) is involved in metabolism of endogenous compounds, drugs, and procarcinogens. Two common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in CYP2C9 are associated with reduced enzyme activity: CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853, R144C) and CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910, I359L). METHODS: We investigated whether CYP2C9 genotype was associated with risk of colorectal adenoma and/or modified associations with aspirin treatment or cigarette smoking in a cohort of 928 participants in a randomized trial of aspirin chemoprevention. Generalized linear regression was used to compute relative risks (RRs) and 95_% confidence intervals (95_% CIs). Multiplicative interactions terms were used to assess effect modification. RESULTS: CYP2C9 genotype was associated with increased risks for adenoma recurrence of 29_% (RR_=_1.29, 95_% CI 1.09-1.51) for _1 variant allele (CYP2C9*2 or *3) and 47_% (RR_=_1.47, 95_% CI 1.19-1.83) for _1 CYP2C9*3 allele. The risk for advanced lesions or multiple (_3) adenomas was increased by 64_% (RR_=_1.64, 95_% CI 1.18-2.28) for _1 variant allele (CYP2C9*2 or *3) and 79_% (RR_=_1.79, 95_% CI 1.16-2.75) for _1 CYP2C9*3 allele. Genotype modified associations with smoking, but not aspirin treatment. The adenoma risk was increased by 26_% (RR_=_1.26, 95_% CI 0.99-1.58) for former smokers and 60_% (RR_=_1.60, 95_% CI 1.19-2.15) for current smokers among wild-type individuals, but there was no increased risk among individuals with _1 variant allele (CYP2C9*2 or *3) (p (interaction)_=_0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of CYP2C9 variants with lower enzyme activity have increased overall risk of colorectal adenoma but reduced adenoma risk associated with cigarette smoking. These results may be due to effects on the synthesis of endogenous eicosanoids and/or reduced activation of procarcinogens in smoke by CYP2C9 variants.",,,3,,,
1465,"Genetic variants in CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and VDR modify the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation for increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in a randomized controlled trial CONTEXT: Adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, [25(OH)D], are required for optimal bone health, and low levels are associated with chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether 41 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin D and calcium pathway genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, VDR, and CASR) are associated with [25(OH)D] or modify the increase in [25(OH)D] from vitamin D3 supplementation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Baseline and year 1 [25(OH)D] measurements from a randomized controlled trial conducted at 11 clinical centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1787 healthy non-Hispanic white participants aged 45-75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Vitamin D3 (1000 IU/d), calcium carbonate (1200 mg/d elemental), both, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genotype main effects and interactions with vitamin D3 treatment estimated using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The baseline serum [25(OH)D] was 25.4 _ 8.7 ng/mL (mean _ SD). Associations with baseline levels were discovered for SNPs in CYP24A1 (rs2209314, rs2762939) and confirmed for SNPs in GC and CYP2R1. After 1 year, [25(OH)D] increased on average by 6.1 _ 8.9 ng/mL on vitamin D3 treatment and decreased by 1.1 _ 8.4 ng/mL on placebo. The increase in [25(OH)D] due to vitamin D3 supplementation was modified by genotypes at rs10766197 near CYP2R1, rs6013897 near CYP24A1, and rs7968585 near VDR. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in [25(OH)D] attributable to vitamin D3 supplementation may vary according to common genetic differences in vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1), 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes. These findings have implications for achieving optimal vitamin D status and potentially for vitamin D-related health outcomes.",,,8,,,

A risk-based approach to addressing the HIV epidemic focuses on what is lacking and reinforces negative stereotypes about already-marginalized populations. In contrast, a strengths-based approach builds on Black GBMSM's existing strengths, recognizing the remarkable ways in which they are overcoming barriers to HIV prevention and care. HealthMpowerment (HMP) is an online, mobile phone optimized intervention that aimed to reduce condomless anal intercourse and foster community among young Black GBMSM (age 18-30). Applying a resilience framework, we analyzed 322 conversations contributed by 48 HMP participants (22/48 living with HIV) on the intervention website. These conversations provided a unique opportunity to observe and analyze dynamic, interpersonal resilience processes shared in response to stigma, discrimination, and life challenges experienced by young Black GBMSM. We utilized an existing framework with four resilience processes and identified new subthemes that were displayed in these online interactions: (1) Exchanging social support occurred through sharing emotional and informational support. (2) Engaging in health-promoting cognitive processes appeared as reframing, self-acceptance, endorsing a positive outlook, and agency and taking responsibility for outcomes. (3) Enacting healthy behavioral practices clustered into modeling sex-positive norms, reducing the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, and living well with HIV. (4) Finally, empowering other gay and bisexual youth occurred through role modeling, promoting self-advocacy, and providing encouragement. Future online interventions could advance strengths-based approaches within HIV prevention and care by intentionally building on Black GBMSM's existing resilience processes. The accessibility and anonymity of online spaces may provide a particularly powerful intervention modality for amplifying resilience among young Black GBMSM.",,,6,,,
1467,"Access to treatment in HIV prevention trials: perspectives from a South African community Access to treatment, in HIV vaccine trials (HVTs), remains ethically controversial. In most prevention trials, including in South Africa, participants who seroconvert are referred to publicly funded programmes for treatment. This strategy is problematic when there is inadequate and uneven access to public sector antiretroviral therapy (ART) and support resources. The responsibilities, if any, of researchers, sponsors and public health authorities involved in HVTs has been hotly debated among academics, scholars, representatives of international organizations and sponsors. However, there is little published on community perceptions. Recent guidance asserts that communities should make inputs into treatment and care decisions. This qualitative study explored a South African community's perceptions of who should provide what to HVT participants as well as how and why this should be done. Twenty-nine adults working at or attending five primary health care clinics in two rural areas in KwaZulu-Natal participated in in-depth interviews. Respondents expressed that researchers should 'help participants to access' treatment and care 'because they are in a position to do so' and 'are in a relationship with' trial participants. Respondents suggested that researchers could help by 'facilitating referral' until such time that participants can access care and treatment on their own. We highlight a series of implications for researchers in HVTs, including their need to be aware of prospective participants' considerable trust in and respect for researchers, the responsibility that this places on them, and the need for clear communication with communities so as not to erode community trust.",,,6,,,
1468,"Disparities in breastfeeding: impact on maternal and child health outcomes and costs OBJECTIVE: To estimate the disease burden and associated costs attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding rates among non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs), Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). STUDY DESIGN: Using current literature on associations between breastfeeding and health outcomes for 8 pediatric and 5 maternal diseases, we used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate 2 hypothetical cohorts of US women followed from age 15 to 70 years and their infants followed from birth to age 20 years. Accounting for differences in parity, maternal age, and birth weights by race/ethnicity, we examined disease outcomes and costs using 2012 breastfeeding rates by race/ethnicity and outcomes that would be expected if 90% of infants were breastfed according to recommendations for exclusive and continued breastfeeding duration. RESULTS: Suboptimal breastfeeding is associated with a greater burden of disease among NHB and Hispanic populations. Compared with a NHW population, a NHB population had 1.7 times the number of excess cases of acute otitis media attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding (95% CI 1.7-1.7), 3.3 times the number of excess cases of necrotizing enterocolitis (95% CI 2.9-3.7), and 2.2 times the number of excess child deaths (95% CI 1.6-2.8). Compared with a NHW population, a Hispanic population had 1.4 times the number of excess cases of gastrointestinal infection (95% CI 1.4-1.4) and 1.5 times the number of excess child deaths (95% CI 1.2-1.9). CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding have important social, economic, and health implications, assuming a causal relationship between breastfeeding and health outcomes.

1469,"Suboptimal breastfeeding in the United States: Maternal and pediatric health outcomes and costs The aim of this study was to quantify the excess cases of pediatric and maternal disease, death, and costs attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding rates in the United States. Using the current literature on the associations between breastfeeding and health outcomes for nine pediatric and five maternal diseases, we created Monte Carlo simulations modeling a hypothetical cohort of U.S. women followed from age 15 to age 70_years and their children from birth to age 20_years. We examined disease outcomes using (a) 2012 breastfeeding rates and (b) assuming that 90% of infants were breastfed according to medical recommendations. We measured annual excess cases, deaths, and associated costs, in 2014 dollars, using a 2% discount rate. Annual excess deaths attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding total 3,340 (95% confidence interval [1,886 to 4,785]), 78% of which are maternal due to myocardial infarction (n_=_986), breast cancer (n_=_838), and diabetes (n_=_473). Excess pediatric deaths total 721, mostly due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (n_=_492) and necrotizing enterocolitis (n_=_190). Medical costs total $3.0 billion, 79% of which are maternal. Costs of premature death total $14.2 billion. The number of women needed to breastfeed as medically recommended to prevent an infant gastrointestinal infection is 0.8; acute otitis media, 3; hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection, 95; maternal hypertension, 55; diabetes, 162; and myocardial infarction, 235. For every 597 women who optimally breastfeed, one maternal or child death is prevented. Policies to increase optimal breastfeeding could result in substantial public health gains. Breastfeeding has a larger impact on women's health than previously appreciated. _ 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,2,,,
1470,"Selective targeting of the repressive transcription factors YY1 and cMyc to disrupt quiescent human immunodeficiency viruses Quiescent HIV-1 infection of resting CD4(+) T cells is an obstacle to eradication of HIV-1 infection. These reservoirs are maintained, in part, by repressive complexes that bind to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs). cMyc and YY1 are two transcription factors that are recruited as part of well-described, distinct complexes to the HIV-1 LTR and in turn recruit HDACs. In prior studies, depletion of single factors that recruit HDAC1 in various cell lines was sufficient to upregulate LTR activity. We used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to test the effect of targeted disruption of a single transcription factor on quiescent proviruses in T cell lines. In this study, we found that depletion of YY1 significantly increases mRNA and protein expression from the HIV-1 promoter in some contexts, but does not affect HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, or acetylated histone 3 occupancy of the HIV-1 LTR. Conversely, depletion of cMyc or cMyc and YY1 does not significantly alter the level of transcription from the LTR or affect recruitment of HDACs to the HIV-1 LTR. Furthermore, global inhibition of HDACs with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) enhanced the increase in LTR transcription in cells that were depleted of YY1.These findings show that despite prior isolated findings, redundancy in repressors of HIV-1 LTR expression will require selective targeting of multiple restrictive mechanisms to comprehensively induce the escape of quiescent proviruses from latency.",,,1,,,
1471,"Selective HDAC inhibition for the disruption of latent HIV-1 infection Selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have emerged as a potential anti-latency therapy for persistent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We utilized a combination of small molecule inhibitors and short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated gene knockdown strategies to delineate the key HDAC(s) to be targeted for selective induction of latent HIV-1 expression. Individual depletion of HDAC3 significantly induced expression from the HIV-1 promoter in the 2D10 latency cell line model. However, depletion of HDAC1 or -2 alone or in combination did not significantly induce HIV-1 expression. Co-depletion of HDAC2 and -3 resulted in a significant increase in expression from the HIV-1 promoter. Furthermore, concurrent knockdown of HDAC1, -2, and -3 resulted in a significant increase in expression from the HIV-1 promoter. Using small molecule HDAC inhibitors of differing selectivity to ablate the residual HDAC activity that remained after (sh)RNA depletion, the effect of depletion of HDAC3 was further enhanced. Enzymatic inhibition of HDAC3 with the selective small-molecule inhibitor BRD3308 activated HIV-1 transcription in the 2D10 cell line. Furthermore, ex vivo exposure to BRD3308 induced outgrowth of HIV-1 from resting CD4+ T cells isolated from antiretroviral-treated, aviremic HIV+ patients. Taken together these findings suggest that HDAC3 is an essential target to disrupt HIV-1 latency, and inhibition of HDAC2 may also contribute to the effort to purge and eradicate latent HIV-1 infection.",,,6,,,

1473,"New frontiers in patient-reported outcomes: adverse event reporting, comparative effectiveness, and quality assessment Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are data elements directly reported by patients or their surrogates about experiences with care, including symptoms, functional status, or quality of life. PROs have commonly been evaluated in clinical trials for drug and medical device development. Interest is growing in the ability to integrate PROs into additional contexts, particularly product safety evaluation, comparative effectiveness research, and measurement of care quality. This interest reflects a growing focus on patient-centeredness in health care broadly and on provisions of the US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Multiple initiatives demonstrate the feasibility and value of patient reporting in these areas. Inclusion of PROs in electronic health records and hospital patient portals, as well as longitudinal registries, can facilitate use of these data for multiple analytic purposes as well as enhance delivery of care and patient-provider communication. Challenges include the logistics and cost of implementing PRO programs; missing data, particularly from hard-to-reach and ill patients; and the need for standardization of outcome measures and electronic data representation. These challenges have been surmounted in limited initiatives and now must be translated to larger implementations.",,,5,,,

1476,"Recommendations for incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical comparative effectiveness research in adult oncology Examining the patient's subjective experience in prospective clinical comparative effectiveness research (CER) of oncology treatments or process interventions is essential for informing decision making. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are the standard tools for directly eliciting the patient experience. There are currently no widely accepted standards for developing or implementing PRO measures in CER. Recommendations for the design and implementation of PRO measures in CER were developed via a standardized process including multistakeholder interviews, a technical working group, and public comments. Key recommendations are to include assessment of patient-reported symptoms as well as health-related quality of life in all prospective clinical CER studies in adult oncology; to identify symptoms relevant to a particular study population and context based on literature review and/or qualitative and quantitative methods; to assure that PRO measures used are valid, reliable, and sensitive in a comparable population (measures particularly recommended include EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT, MDASI, PRO-CTCAE, and PROMIS); to collect PRO data electronically whenever possible; to employ methods that minimize missing patient reports and include a plan for analyzing and reporting missing PRO data; to report the proportion of responders and cumulative distribution of responses in addition to mean changes in scores; and to publish results of PRO analyses simultaneously with other clinical outcomes. Twelve core symptoms are recommended for consideration in studies in advanced or metastatic cancers. Adherence to methodologic standards for the selection, implementation, and analysis/reporting of PRO measures will lead to an understanding of the patient experience that informs better decisions by patients, providers, regulators, and payers.",,,7,,,
1477,"Symptom Monitoring With Patient-Reported Outcomes During Routine Cancer Treatment: A Randomized Controlled Trial PURPOSE: There is growing interest to enhance symptom monitoring during routine cancer care using patient-reported outcomes, but evidence of impact on clinical outcomes is limited. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients receiving routine outpatient chemotherapy for advanced solid tumors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to report 12 common symptoms via tablet computers or to receive usual care consisting of symptom monitoring at the discretion of clinicians. Those with home computers received weekly e-mail prompts to report between visits. Treating physicians received symptom printouts at visits, and nurses received e-mail alerts when participants reported severe or worsening symptoms. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life (HRQL) at 6 months compared with baseline, measured by the EuroQol EQ-5D Index. Secondary endpoints included emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and survival. RESULTS: Among 766 patients allocated, HRQL improved among more participants in the intervention group than usual care (34% v 18%) and worsened among fewer (38% v 53%; P < .001). Overall, mean HRQL declined by less in the intervention group than usual care (1.4- v 7.1-point drop; P < .001). Patients receiving intervention were less frequently admitted to the ER (34% v 41%; P = .02) or hospitalized (45% v 49%; P = .08) and remained on chemotherapy longer (mean, 8.2 v 6.3 months; P = .002). Although 75% of the intervention group was alive at 1 year, 69% with usual care survived the year (P = .05), with differences also seen in quality-adjusted survival (mean of 8.7 v. 8.0 months; P = .004). Benefits were greater for participants lacking prior computer experience. Most patients receiving intervention (63%) reported severe symptoms during the study. Nurses frequently initiated clinical actions in response to e-mail alerts. CONCLUSION: Clinical benefits were associated with symptom self-reporting during cancer care. _ 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,,3,,,
1478,"Patient-reported outcome measurement in drug discovery: a tool to improve accuracy and completeness of efficacy and safety data INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) reflect how patients feel and function as conveyed directly by patients themselves, for example symptoms and physical functioning. PRO measures can be included in any phase of product development as primary, secondary, or exploratory endpoints to understand the impact of treatment on the patient experience. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors describe approaches commonly used to assess PROs in drug development programs, including how to select or develop outcomes and measures, implement these in trials, and analyze data. Barriers and facilitators for effectively including PROs in clinical trials are discussed, and strategies for making labeling claims based on PRO data are noted. EXPERT OPINION: Early planning with PRO experts is recommended to assure a successful PRO strategy in a product development program. Outcomes that are meaningful to patients should be rationally identified early in a product development program based on qualitative work, literature search and/or assumed mechanism of action. Measures corresponding to those outcomes should be selected or developed, with demonstration of robust psychometric properties in a related patient population. Ideally, these measures will be tested prior to a pivotal trial to support the design and analysis in the pivotal trial. Selection of timing and mode of assessments should be specified a priori and justified. If a labeling claim is sought, a statistical plan should be pre-specified. Strategies to minimize and handle missing data in analyses should be planned up front.",,,1,,,
1479,"Feasibility assessment of patient reporting of symptomatic adverse events in multicenter cancer clinical trials Importance: In cancer clinical trials, symptomatic adverse events (AEs), such as nausea, are reported by investigators rather than by patients. There is increasing interest to collect symptomatic AE data via patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires, but it is unclear whether it is feasible to implement this approach in multicenter trials. Objective: To examine whether patients are willing and able to report their symptomatic AEs in multicenter trials. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 361 consecutive patients enrolled in any 1 of 9 US multicenter cancer treatment trials were invited to self-report 13 common symptomatic AEs using a PRO adaptation of the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) via tablet computers at 5 successive clinic visits. Patient adherence was tracked with reasons for missed self-reports. Agreement with clinician AE reports was analyzed with weighted _ statistics. Patient and investigator perspectives were elicited by survey. The study was conducted from March 15, 2007, to August 11, 2011. Data analysis was performed from August 9, 2013, to March 21, 2014. Results: Of the 361 patients invited to participate, 285 individuals enrolled, with a median age of 57 years (range, 24-88), 202 (74.3%) female, 241 (85.5%) white, 73 (26.8%) with a high school education or less, and 176 (64.7%) who reported regular internet use (denominators varied owing to missing data). Across all patients and trials, there were 1280 visits during which patients had an opportunity to self-report (ie, patients were alive and enrolled in a treatment trial at the time of the visit). Self-reports were completed at 1202 visits (93.9% overall adherence). Adherence was highest at baseline and declined over time (visit 1, 100%; visit 2, 96%; visit 3, 95%; visit 4, 91%; and visit 5, 85%). Reasons for missing PROs included institutional errors in 27 of 48 (56.3%) of the cases (eg, staff forgetting to bring computers to patients at visits), patients feeling ""too ill"" in 8 (16.7%), patient refusal in 8 (16.7%), and internet connectivity problems in 5 (10.4%). Patient-investigator CTCAE agreement was moderate or worse for most symptoms (most __< _0.05), with investigators reporting fewer AEs than patients across symptoms. Most patients believed that the system was easy to use (234 [93.2%]) and useful (230 [93.1%]), and investigators thought that the patient-reported AEs were useful (133 [94.3%]) and accurate (119 [83.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Participants in multicenter cancer trials are willing and able to report their own symptomatic AEs at most clinic visits and report more AEs than investigators. This approach may improve the precision of AE reporting in cancer trials.",,,3,,,
1480,"Feasibility of Implementing the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events in a Multicenter Trial: NCCTG N1048 Purpose The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) was developed to enable patient reporting of symptomatic adverse events in oncology clinical research. This study was designed to assess the feasibility and resource requirements associated with implementing PRO-CTCAE in a multicenter trial. Methods Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer enrolled in the National Cancer Institute-sponsored North Central Cancer Treatment Group (Alliance) Preoperative Radiation or Selective Preoperative Radiation and Evaluation before Chemotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision trial were asked to self-report 30 PRO-CTCAE items weekly from home during preoperative therapy, and every 6 months after surgery, via either the Web or an automated telephone system. If participants did not self-report within 3 days, a central coordinator called them to complete the items. Compliance was defined as the proportion of participants who completed PRO-CTCAE assessments at expected time points. Results The prespecified PRO-CTCAE analysis was conducted after the 500th patient completed the 6-month follow-up (median age, 56 years; 33% female; 12% nonwhite; 43% high school education or less; 5% Spanish speaking), across 165 sites. PRO-CTCAE was reported by participants at 4,491 of 4,882 expected preoperative time points (92.0% compliance), of which 3,771 (77.2%) were self-reported by participants and 720 (14.7%) were collected via central coordinator backup. Compliance at 6-month post-treatment follow-up was 333 of 468 (71.2%), with 122 (26.1%) via backup. Site research associates spent a median of 15 minutes on PRO-CTCAE work for each patient visit. Work by a central coordinator required a 50% time commitment. Conclusion Home-based reporting of PRO-CTCAE in a multicenter trial is feasible, with high patient compliance and low site administrative requirements. PRO-CTCAE data capture is improved through centralized backup calls.",,,0,,,

METHODS: The American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based recommendations informed by a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: When added to androgen deprivation, therapies demonstrating improved survival, improved quality of life (QOL), and favorable benefit-harm balance include abiraterone acetate/prednisone, enzalutamide, and radium-223 ((223)Ra; for men with predominantly bone metastases). Improved survival and QOL with moderate toxicity risk are associated with docetaxel/prednisone. For asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic men, improved survival with unclear QOL impact and low toxicity are associated with sipuleucel-T. For men who previously received docetaxel, improved survival, unclear QOL impact, and moderate to high toxicity risk are associated with cabazitaxel/prednisone. Modest QOL benefit (without survival benefit) and high toxicity risk are associated with mitoxantrone/prednisone after docetaxel. No benefit and excess toxicity are observed with bevacizumab, estramustine, and sunitinib. RECOMMENDATIONS: Continue androgen deprivation (pharmaceutical or surgical) indefinitely. Abiraterone acetate/prednisone, enzalutamide, or (223)Ra should be offered; docetaxel/prednisone should also be offered, accompanied by discussion of toxicity risk. Sipuleucel-T may be offered to asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic men. For men who have experienced progression with docetaxel, cabazitaxel may be offered, accompanied by discussion of toxicity risk. Mitoxantrone may be offered, accompanied by discussion of limited clinical benefit and toxicity risk. Ketoconazole or antiandrogens (eg, bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide) may be offered, accompanied by discussion of limited known clinical benefit. Bevacizumab, estramustine, and sunitinib should not be offered. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate optimal sequences or combinations of therapies.

1482,"Antiemetics: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update PURPOSE: To update the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for antiemetics in oncology. METHODS: A systematic review of the medical literature was completed to inform this update. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Collaboration Library, and meeting materials from ASCO and the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer were all searched. Primary outcomes of interest were complete response and rates of any vomiting or nausea. RESULTS: Thirty-seven trials met prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria for this systematic review. Two systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration were identified; one surveyed the pediatric literature. The other compared the relative efficacy of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists. RECOMMENDATIONS: Combined anthracycline and cyclophosphamide regimens were reclassified as highly emetic. Patients who receive this combination or any highly emetic agents should receive a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a neurokinin 1 (NK(1)) receptor antagonist. A large trial validated the equivalency of fosaprepitant, a single-day intravenous formulation, with aprepitant; either therapy is appropriate. Preferential use of palonosetron is recommended for moderate emetic risk regimens, combined with dexamethasone. For low-risk agents, patients can be offered dexamethasone before the first dose of chemotherapy. Patients undergoing high emetic risk radiation therapy should receive a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist before each fraction and for 24 hours after treatment and may receive a 5-day course of dexamethasone during fractions 1 to 5. The Update Committee noted the importance of continued symptom monitoring throughout therapy. Clinicians underestimate the incidence of nausea, which is not as well controlled as emesis.",,,5,,,

These associations have not been evaluated in Asia, where the high exposure and historical environmental contamination of certain OC pesticides (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], hexachlorocyclohexane [HCH]) are different from Western populations. We evaluated NHL risk and prediagnostic blood levels of OC pesticides/metabolites and polychlorinated biphenyl congeners in a case-control study of 167 NHL cases and 167 controls nested within three prospective cohorts in Shanghai and Singapore. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze lipid-adjusted OC levels and NHL risk. Median levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), the primary DDT metabolite, and _-HCH were up to 12 and 65 times higher, respectively, in samples from the Asian cohorts compared to several cohorts in the United States and Norway. An increased risk of NHL was observed among those with higher _-HCH levels both overall (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 1.8, 95%CI = 1.0-3.2; ptrend = 0.049) and after excluding cases diagnosed within 2__ears of blood collection (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 2.0, 95%CI = 1.1-3.9; ptrend = 0.03), and the association was highly consistent across the three cohorts. No significant associations were observed for other OCs, including p,p'-DDE. Our findings provide support for an association between _-HCH blood levels and NHL risk. This is a concern because substantial quantities of persistent, toxic residues of HCH are present in the environment worldwide. Although there is some evidence that DDT is associated with NHL, our findings for p,p'-DDE do not support an association. _ 2019 UICC.",,,3,,,
1488,"Integrating genomic analysis with the genetic basis of gene expression: preliminary evidence of the identification of causal genes for cardiovascular and metabolic traits related to nutrition in Mexicans Whole-transcriptome expression profiling provides novel phenotypes for analysis of complex traits. Gene expression measurements reflect quantitative variation in transcript-specific messenger RNA levels and represent phenotypes lying close to the action of genes. Understanding the genetic basis of gene expression will provide insight into the processes that connect genotype to clinically significant traits representing a central tenet of system biology. Synchronous in vivo expression profiles of lymphocytes, muscle, and subcutaneous fat were obtained from healthy Mexican men. Most genes were expressed at detectable levels in multiple tissues, and RNA levels were correlated between tissue types. A subset of transcripts with high reliability of expression across tissues (estimated by intraclass correlation coefficients) was enriched for cis-regulated genes, suggesting that proximal sequence variants may influence expression similarly in different cellular environments. This integrative global gene expression profiling approach is proving extremely useful for identifying genes and pathways that contribute to complex clinical traits. Clearly, the coincidence of clinical trait quantitative trait loci and expression quantitative trait loci can help in the prioritization of positional candidate genes. Such data will be crucial for the formal integration of positional and transcriptomic information characterized as genetical genomics.",,,1,,,
1489,"Expected changes in obesity after reformulation to reduce added sugars in beverages: A modeling study BACKGROUND: Several strategies have been proposed to reduce the intake of added sugars in the population. In Mexico, a 10% sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) tax was implemented in 2014, and the implementation of other nutritional policies, such as product reformulation to reduce added sugars, is under discussion. WHO recommends that all individuals consume less than 10% of their total energy intake (TEI) from added sugars. We propose gradually reducing added sugars in SSBs to achieve an average 10% consumption of added sugars in the Mexican population over 10 years and to estimate the expected impact of reformulation in adult body weight and obesity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Baseline consumption for added sugars and SSBs, sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES), height, and weight for Mexican adults were obtained from the 2012 Mexico National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT). On average, 12.6% of the TEI was contributed by added sugars; we defined a 50% reduction in added sugars in SSBs over 10 years as a reformulation target. Using a dynamic weight change model, sugar reductions were translated into individual expected changes in body weight assuming a 43% caloric compensation and a 2-year lag for the full effect of reformulation to occur. Results were stratified by sex, age, and SES. Twelve years after reformulation, the TEI from added sugars is expected to decrease to 10%, assuming no compensation from added sugars; 44% of the population would still be above WHO recommendations, requiring further sugar reductions to food. Body weight could be reduced by 1.3 kg (95% CI -1.4 to -1.2) in the adult population, and obesity could decrease 3.9 percentage points (pp; -12.5% relative to baseline). Our sensitivity analyses suggest that the impact of the intervention could vary from 0.12 kg after 6 months to 1.52 kg in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Reformulation to reduce added sugars in SSBs could produce large reductions in sugar consumption and obesity in the Mexican adult population. This study is limited by the use of a single dietary recall and by data collected in all seasons except summer; still, these limitations should lead to conservative estimates of the reformulation effect. Reformulation success could depend on government enforcement and industry and consumer response, for which further research and evidence are needed.",,,1,,,
1490,"Averting obesity and type 2 diabetes in India through sugar-sweetened beverage taxation: an economic-epidemiologic modeling study BACKGROUND: Taxing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has been proposed in high-income countries to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes. We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India, where there is heterogeneity in SSB consumption, patterns of substitution between SSBs and other beverages after tax increases, and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of 100,855 Indian households, we first calculated how changes in SSB price alter per capita consumption of SSBs and substitution with other beverages. We then incorporated SSB sales trends, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes incidence data stratified by age, sex, income, and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption, glycemic load, overweight/obesity prevalence, and type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian subpopulations facing a 20% SSB excise tax. The 20% SSB tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0% (95% CI 1.6%-5.9%) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6% (95% CI 1.2%-1.9%) among various Indian subpopulations over the period 2014-2023, if SSB consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends. However, acceleration in SSB consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation, averting 4.2% of prevalent overweight/obesity (95% CI 2.5-10.0%) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.0-2.8%) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014-2023. Given current consumption and BMI distributions, our results suggest the largest relative effect would be expected among young rural men, refuting our a priori hypothesis that urban populations would be isolated beneficiaries of SSB taxation. Key limitations of this estimation approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years, captured in price elasticities, will reflect future behavior among consumers, and potential underreporting of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our calculations. CONCLUSION: Sustained SSB taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in India among both urban and rural subpopulations.",,,4,,,
1491,"Impact of participant and interventionist race concordance on weight loss outcomes OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that racial composition of behavioral intervention groups does not affect achieved weight loss. However, it is unclear if the race of the interventionist affects intervention outcomes. The objective of this analysis is to estimate the impact of race concordance between participant and interventionist on weight change in the initial weight loss phase (phase I) of the Weight Loss Maintenance trial (WLM). DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,685 overweight or obese adults (BMI 25-45 kg/m(2) ) who were taking medication for hypertension and/or dyslipidemia participated in phase I of the WLM trial. All participants received a 6-month intensive behavioral intervention in groups of 15-20 facilitated by a trained interventionist. The main outcome is change in weight at 6 months. RESULTS: Participants were on average 55 years of age, 67% female and 44% African American (AA). Three of seventeen interventionists were AA, 14 were non-AA. Seventy-three percent of participants shared race concordance with the interventionist. There was a small but statistically significant difference in weight change of participants who were the same race as the interventionist (-5.84 kg, s.e. 0.17) as compared with those who were not race concordant (-5.04 kg, s.e. 0.33), a difference of 0.8 kg, (P = 0.04). The impact of concordance on weight change differed by race (i.e., interaction of race and concordance was significant, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In a post hoc analysis of a group-based behavioral intervention, race concordance for non-AA participants was associated with slightly greater weight loss. Race concordance was not associated with weight loss for AA participants. Copyright _ 2012 The Obesity Society.",,,1,,,
1492,"Food acculturation drives dietary differences among Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Non-Hispanic Whites Our aim was to examine the effects of food acculturation on Mexican Americans' (MA) diets, taking the Mexican diet as reference. We used nationally representative samples of children (2-11 y) and female adolescents and adults (12-49 y) from the Mexican National Nutrition Survey 1999 and NHANES 1999-2006 to compare the diets of Mexicans (n = 5678), MA born in Mexico (MAMX) (n = 1488), MA born in the United States (MAUS) (n = 3654), and non-Hispanic white Americans (NH-White) (n = 5473). One 24-h diet recall was used to examine the percentage consuming and percentage energy consumed from selected food groups. Most of the food groups analyzed displayed a fairly linear increase or decrease in percent energy/capita intake in this order: Mexican, MAMX, MAUS, NH-White. However, few significant differences were observed among the US subpopulations, especially among MAUS and NH-Whites. Overall, compared to Mexicans, the US subpopulations had greater intakes of saturated fat, sugar, dessert and salty snacks, pizza and French fries, low-fat meat and fish, high-fiber bread, and low-fat milk, as well as decreased intakes of corn tortillas, low-fiber bread, high-fat milk, and Mexican fast food. Furthermore, the patterns were similar in all age groups. Although we found a mix of positive and negative aspects of food acculturation, the overall proportion of energy obtained from unhealthy foods was higher among the US subpopulations. Our findings indicate that within one generation in the US, the influence of the Mexican diet is almost lost. In addition, our results reinforce the need to discourage critical unhealthful components of the American diet among MA.",,,4,,,

1494,"Longitudinal analysis of dietary patterns in Chinese adults from 1991 to 2009 In the present study, we aimed to identify the changes or stability in the structure of dietary patterns and tracking, trends and factors related to the adherence to these dietary patterns in China from 1991 to 2009. We analysed dietary data collected during seven waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey and included 9253 adults with complete dietary data for three or more waves. Dietary intake assessment was carried out over a 3 d period with 24 h recalls and a household food inventory. Using factor analysis in each wave, we found that the structure of the two dietary patterns identified remained stable over the studied period. The traditional southern dietary pattern was characterised by high intakes of rice, fresh leafy vegetables, low-fat red meat, pork, organ meats, poultry and fish/seafood and low intakes of wheat flour and maize/coarse grains and the modern high-wheat dietary pattern was characterised by high intakes of wheat buns/breads, cakes/cookies/pastries, deep-fried wheat, nuts/seeds, starchy root/tuber products, fruits, eggs/egg products, soya milk, animal-based milk and instant noodles/frozen dumplings. Temporal tracking (maintenance of a relative position over time) was higher for the traditional southern dietary pattern, whereas adherence to the modern high-wheat dietary pattern had an upward trend over time. Higher income, education and urbanicity levels were positively associated with both the dietary patterns, but the association became weaker in the later years. These results suggest that even in the context of rapid economic changes in China, the way people chose to combine their foods remained relatively stable. However, the increasing popularity of the modern high-wheat dietary pattern, a pattern associated with several energy-dense foods, is a cause of concern.",,,4,,,
1495,"Cancer cachexia: muscle physiology and exercise training Cachexia in cancer patients is a condition marked by severe tissue wasting and a myriad of quality of life and health consequences. Cachexia is also directly linked to the issues of morbidity and survivability in cancer patients. Therapeutic means of mitigating cachexia and its effects are thus critical in cancer patient treatment. We present a discussion on the use of physical exercise activities in the context of such treatment as a means to disruption the tissue wasting effects (i.e., muscle tissue losses via anorexigenic pro-inflammatory cytokines) of cachexia. In addition we propose a theoretical model (Exercise Anti-Cachectic Hypothetical-""EACH"" model) as to how exercise training may promote a disruption in the cycle of events leading to advancing cachexia and in turn promote an enhanced functionality and thus improved quality of life in cancer patients.",,,3,,,
1496,"A family based study of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide signalling genes and preeclampsia BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is thought to originate during placentation, with incomplete remodelling and perfusion of the spiral arteries leading to reduced placental vascular capacity. Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are powerful vasodilators that play a role in the placental vascular system. Although family clustering of preeclampsia has been observed, the existing genetic literature is limited by a failure to consider both mother and child. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within the Norwegian Mother and Child Birth Cohort of 1545 case-pairs and 995 control-pairs from 2540 validated dyads (2011 complete pairs, 529 missing mother or child genotype). We selected 1518 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency >5% in NO and CO signalling pathways. We used log-linear Poisson regression models and likelihood ratio tests to assess maternal and child effects. RESULTS: One SNP met criteria for a false discovery rate Q-value < 0.05. The child variant, rs12547243 in adenylate cyclase 8 (ADCY8), was associated with an increased risk (relative risk [RR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20, 1.69 for AG vs. GG, RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.47, 3.11 for AA vs. GG, Q = 0.03). The maternal variant, rs30593 in PDE1C was associated with a decreased risk for the subtype of preeclampsia accompanied by early delivery (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27, 0.75 for TC vs. CC; Q = 0.02). None of the associations were replicated after correction for multiple testing.

1498,"Stigma diminishes the protective effect of social support on psychological distress among young black men who have sex with men Addressing stigma remains a pressing HIV priority globally. Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM, ages 18-30; N = 474) completed an in-person baseline survey and reported their experiences of externalized stigma (i.e., racial and sexuality discrimination), internalized stigma (i.e., homonegativity), social support, and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depression symptoms). We used structural equation modeling to test the association between stigma and psychological distress, and examined whether social support mediated the relationship between stigma and psychological distress. Recognizing that these associations may differ by HIV status, we compared our models by self-reported HIV status (n = 275 HIV negative/unknown; n = 199 living with HIV). Our findings suggest that YBMSM who experience stigma are more vulnerable to psychological distress and may have diminished buffering through social support. These effects are accentuated among YBMSM living with HIV, highlighting the need for additional research focused on the development of tailored stigma reduction interventions for YBMSM.",,,2,,,

HealthMpowerment.org (HMP) is an interactive mobile phone- and web-based HIV prevention and care intervention for young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM; ages 18-30) in the United States. HMP included three forums where participants could share their experiences. In this study, we explored whether engaging in stigma-related discussions was associated with changes in YBMSM's stigma-related scores throughout the trial. YBMSM (ages 18-30; N_=_238) participating in HMP completed surveys at baseline, and 3 and 6_month follow-ups that included a series of scales focused on HIV and sexuality (internalized homophobia; sexual prejudice) stigma. Sixty-two participants contributed to the forums (1497 posts). We coded instances where YBMSM's conversations were stigma related (915 posts, 61.1%), including discussions of anticipated (74/915, 8.1%), experienced (125/915, 13.7%), internalized (410/915, 44.8%), and/or challenged (639/915, 69.8%) stigma regarding sexuality and HIV. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined whether changes in YBMSM's stigma scores were associated with stigma-related discussions within the forum. We controlled for age, HIV status, income, and educational attainment in these multivariable models. YBMSM who discussed experiencing HIV stigma in the forums reported decreases in perceived HIV stigma over time (b_=_-_0.37, p____0.05). YBMSM whose forum posts indicated anticipated HIV stigma reported increases in HIV stigma over time (b_=_0.46, p____0.01). Participants who challenged sexuality-related stigma in forums had lower internalized homophobia (b_=_-_0.68, p____0.01) at baseline. YBMSM whose discussions focused on experiencing sexuality-related stigma reported increases in internalized homophobia (b_=_0.39, p____0.01) and sexual prejudice (b_=_0.87, p____0.05) over time. Developing strategies to combat stigma remains a key priority. HMP created an online space where YBMSM could discuss HIV and sexuality stigma. Although a limited number of HMP participants authored the majority of these forum discussions, the discussions were associated with changes in the sample's stigma scores over time. Online interventions (e.g., social media, apps) should consider the inclusion of forums to address stigma and test the efficacy of forums to improve YBMSM's HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes.",,,6,,,
1500,"Maternal mental health in Amhara region, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional survey BACKGROUND: Postpartum common mental disorders (CMD) such as depression and anxiety are increasingly recognized for their burden in low-resource countries such as Ethiopia. However, the magnitude of postpartum CMD in Ethiopia is not well-established. This short report describes the mental health status of women who had given birth in the last 24 months in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1,319 women aged 15-49 years old who had a delivery in the previous 24 months from 30 randomly selected kebeles (smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia) across Amhara region. The survey included the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) developed by the World Health Organization-a CMD screening instrument that includes 20 yes/no questions on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms experienced in the last 30 days. We used 2 cutoff scores to determine probable cases of mental disorder: (1) 4/5 (_ 4 ""yes"" responses=non-case, _ 5 ""yes"" responses=case) based on a study that validated the SRQ-20 against a diagnostic tool in Butajira, Ethiopia, and (2) a more conservative and commonly used 7/8 cutoff. RESULTS: Among the 1,294 women who completed the full survey including the SRQ-20, 32.8% had probable CMD using the 4/5 cutoff score versus 19.8% using the more conservative 7/8 cutoff. About 15% of the women responded affirmatively that they had had suicidal thoughts. CONCLUSION: Poor mental health was common among the surveyed women who had given birth in the past 24 months in Amhara region, Ethiopia. Integrating mental health care into maternal and child health services could potentially alleviate the burden of CMD among women in the extended postpartum period. _ Baumgartner et al.

1503,"Caterpillar cereal as a potential complementary feeding product for infants and young children: nutritional content and acceptability Micronutrient deficiency is an important cause of growth stunting. To avoid micronutrient deficiency, the World Health Organization recommends complementary feeding with animal-source foods. However, animal-source foods are not readily available in many parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In such areas, caterpillars are a staple in adult diets and may be suitable for complementary feeding for infants and young children. We developed a cereal made from dried caterpillars and other locally available ingredients (ground corn, palm oil, sugar and salt), measured its macro- and micronutrient contents and evaluated for microbiologic contamination. Maternal and infant acceptability was evaluated among 20 mothers and their 8-10-month-old infants. Mothers were instructed in the preparation of the cereal and asked to evaluate the cereal in five domains using a Likert scale. Mothers fed their infants a 30-g portion daily for 1 week. Infant acceptability was based on cereal consumption and the occurrence of adverse events. The caterpillar cereal contained 132__cal, 6.9-g protein, 3.8-mg iron and 3.8-mg zinc per 30__ and was free from microbiologic contamination. Mothers' median ratings for cereal characteristics were (5_=__ike very much): overall impression_=_4, taste_=_5, smell_=_4, texture_=_4, colour_=_5, and consistency_=_4. All infants consumed more than 75% of the daily portions, with five infants consuming 100%. No serious adverse events were reported. We conclude that a cereal made from locally available caterpillars has appropriate macro- and micronutrient contents for complementary feeding, and is acceptable to mothers and infants in the DRC. _ 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,1,,,
1504,"Phosphodiesterase 1 regulation is a key mechanism in vascular aging Reduced nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signalling is observed in age-related vascular disease. We hypothesize that this disturbed signalling involves effects of genomic instability, a primary causal factor in aging, on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and that the underlying mechanism plays a role in human age-related vascular disease. To test our hypothesis, we combined experiments in mice with genomic instability resulting from the defective nucleotide excision repair gene ERCC1 (Ercc1(d/-) mice), human VSMC cultures and population genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Aortic rings of Ercc1(d/-) mice showed 43% reduced responses to the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1 and 5 normalized SNP-relaxing effects in Ercc1(d/-) to wild-type (WT) levels. PDE1C levels were increased in lung and aorta. cGMP hydrolysis by PDE in lungs was higher in Ercc1(d/-) mice. No differences in activity or levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 or sGC were observed in Ercc1(d/-) mice compared with WT. Senescent human VSMC showed elevated PDE1A and PDE1C and PDE5 mRNA levels (11.6-, 9- and 2.3-fold respectively), which associated with markers of cellular senescence. Conversely, PDE1 inhibition lowered expression of these markers. Human genetic studies revealed significant associations of PDE1A single nucleotide polymorphisms with diastolic blood pressure (DBP; _=0.28, P=2.47_10(-5)) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT; _=-0.0061, P=2.89_10(-5)). In summary, these results show that genomic instability and cellular senescence in VSMCs increase PDE1 expression. This might play a role in aging-related loss of vasodilator function, VSMC senescence, increased blood pressure and vascular hypertrophy. _ 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.",,,8,,,
1505,"Maximising trichiasis surgery success (MTSS) trial: rationale and design of a randomised controlled trial to improve trachomatous trichiasis surgical outcomes INTRODUCTION: Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) is a condition in which the eyelid turns inward and eyelashes abrade the front part of the eye. To prevent eventual blindness, surgery is recommended. Two surgical procedures are commonly used, bilamellar tarsal rotation (BLTR) and posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (PLTR). Evidence suggests that incision height and surgery type may affect the risk of postoperative TT (PTT) and other surgical outcomes. However, these studies have not prospectively compared the impact of incision height on surgical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Maximising trichiasis surgery Success (MTSS) is a three-arm, randomised clinical trial being conducted in Ethiopia. Participants will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 basis to BLTR with a 3 mm incision height, BLTR with a 5 mm incision height, or PLTR 3 mm incision height. Patients are eligible for the trial if they have previously unoperated upper eyelid TT. Follow-up visits will be conducted by trained eye examiners at 1 day, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 months after surgery. The primary outcome is incident PTT within 1 year following surgery. Logistic regression will be used in an intention-to-treat analysis to assess outcome incidence by surgical approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of North Carolina and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine institution review boards, Ethiopian National Research Ethics Review Committee and Ethiopian Food, Medicine, Healthcare and Administration and Control Authority provided ethics approval for the trial.

1506,"First outpatient follow-up after psychiatric hospitalization: does one size fit all? OBJECTIVE: Claims-based indicators of follow-up within seven and 30 days after psychiatric discharge have face validity as quality measures: early follow-up may improve disease management and guide appropriate service use. Yet these indicators are rarely examined empirically. This study assessed their association with subsequent health care utilization for adults with comorbid conditions. METHODS: Postdischarge follow-up and subsequent utilization were examined among adults enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid who were discharged with claims-based diagnoses of depression or schizophrenia and not readmitted within 30 days. A total of 24,934 discharges (18,341 individuals) in fiscal years 2008-2010 were analyzed. Follow-up was categorized as occurring within 0-7 days, 8-30 days, or none in 30 days. Outcomes in the subsequent six months included psychotropic medication claims, adherence (proportion of days covered), number of hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. RESULTS: Follow-up within seven days was associated with greater medication adherence and outpatient utilization, compared with no follow-up in 30 days. This was observed for both follow-up with a mental health provider and with any provider. Adults receiving mental health follow-up within seven days had equivalent, or lower, subsequent inpatient and emergency department utilization as those without follow-up within 30 days. However, adults receiving follow-up with any provider within seven days were more likely than those with no follow-up to have an inpatient admission or emergency department visit in the subsequent six months. Few differences in subsequent utilization were observed between mental health follow-up within seven days versus eight to 30 days.

BACKGROUND: Medications are an integral component of management for many chronic conditions, and suboptimal adherence limits medication effectiveness among persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Medical homes may provide a mechanism for increasing adherence among persons with MCC, thereby enhancing management of chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between medical home enrollment and adherence to newly initiated medications among Medicaid enrollees with MCC. RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing Community Care of North Carolina medical home enrollees to nonenrollees using merged North Carolina Medicaid claims data (fiscal years 2008-2010). SUBJECTS: Among North Carolina Medicaid-enrolled adults with MCC, we created separate longitudinal cohorts of new users of antidepressants (N=9303), antihypertensive agents (N=12,595), oral diabetic agents (N=6409), and statins (N=9263). MEASURES: Outcomes were the proportion of days covered (PDC) on treatment medication each month for 12 months and a dichotomous measure of adherence (PDC>0.80). Our primary analysis utilized person-level fixed effects models. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score and person-level random-effect models. RESULTS: Compared with nonenrollees, medical home enrollees exhibited higher PDC by 4.7, 6.0, 4.8, and 5.1 percentage points for depression, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, respectively (P's< 0.001). The dichotomous adherence measure showed similar increases, with absolute differences of 4.1, 4.5, 3.5, and 4.6 percentage points, respectively (P's< 0.001).

We found a positive association between PCMH exposure and OAT initiation in unadjusted (6.78%; p < .001) and adjusted (6.25%; p < .001) models. Greater implementation and optimization of PCMH model principles may enhance this association, reducing AF-related stroke morbidity and mortality.",,,5,,,
1509,"A non-experimental study of oral anticoagulation therapy initiation before and after national patient safety goals OBJECTIVES: The Joint Commission revised its National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) to include oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) in 2008. We sought to examine the effect of including OAT in The Joint Commission's NPSGs on historically low rates of OAT initiation for individuals with incident atrial fibrillation (AF). SETTING: Southeastern state in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: North Carolina State Health Plan claims data from 944 500 individuals enrolled between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010, supplemented with data from the Area Resource File and Online Survey, Certification and Reporting data network. We evaluated OAT initiation before and after the 2008 NPSGs revisions in a retrospective cohort new user design with an AF intervention group and two control groups: a positive control-patients estimated to be at very high risk of thromboembolism (mechanical heart valve and pulmonary embolism); and a negative control-patients with very low perceived risk of thromboembolism (paroxysmal AF). We developed multivariable models using a difference-in-difference parameterisation. Effects were estimated with generalised estimating equations. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: OAT initiation, a binary outcome defined as having a prescription drug claim for warfarin within 30 days of the index claim. RESULTS: OAT initiation was low (26.8%) for eligible individuals with incident AF in 2006-2008 but increased after NPSGs implementation (31.7%, p=0.022). OAT initiation was high but decreased in the positive control group (67.5% vs 62.0%, p=0.003). Multivariate analysis resulted in a relative 11% (95% CI (4% to 18%), p< 0.01) increase in OAT initiation for incident AF patients. CONCLUSIONS: We document a substantial increase in guideline concordant OAT initiation in incident AF after the establishment of NPSGs, suggesting that regulatory healthcare agency initiatives can influence clinical practice.",,,5,,,
1510,"Characterization of a Pathogenic Full-Length cDNA Clone and Transmission Model for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strain PC22A UNLABELLED: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic alphacoronavirus. In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms. To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A. The infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo. Importantly, recombinant PEDV was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus. Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate icPEDV-_ORF3-RFP. icPEDV-_ORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes. However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-_ORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus- or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of PC22A. Together, these data describe the development of a robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo, providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting. IMPORTANCE: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged in the United States in 2013 and has since killed 10% of U.S. farm pigs. Though the disease has been circulating internationally for decades, the lack of a rapid reverse-genetics platform for manipulating PEDV and identifying genetic factors that impact transmission and virulence has hindered the study of this important agricultural disease. Here, we present a DNA-based infectious-clone system that replicates the pathogenesis of circulating U.S. strain PC22A both in vitro and in piglets. This infectious clone can be used both to study the genetics, virulence, and transmission of PEDV coronavirus and to inform the creation of a live attenuated PEDV vaccine.

1511,"Predictors of rheumatoid arthritis patient-physician communication about medication costs during visits to rheumatologists OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency with which medication costs are discussed, and the predictors of these discussions, during visits between rheumatologists and their patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Audiotapes of medical visits, patient questionnaires, medical records, and physician questionnaires were collected from March 2003 to December 2005. Data were collected from 200 RA patients from 4 rheumatology clinics. Audiotapes were coded for the presence of communication about medication costs using a detailed coding instrument. The final analysis sample included 193 patients and 8 rheumatologists. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the role of patient, physician, medication, and relationship characteristics on discussions of medication costs. RESULTS: Despite medication changes being made in more than 50% of the visits, only 34% of those visits included discussions of medication-related costs; 48% of these discussions were initiated by patients. In multivariable logistic regression models, communication about medication costs occurred more often when patients were white (compared with nonwhite) and reported an annual income of $20,000-$59,999 (compared with those earning > or =$60,000). Discussions about medication costs also were more common when physicians were white. CONCLUSION: Although medication changes were common, medication costs were only discussed in one-third of the visits. Communication about medication costs was more common among patients who were white and in a middle income category. Disparities in communication about medication costs have the potential to negatively impact prescribing and subsequent medication use. Further research should examine potential disparities in communication about medication costs.",,,1,,,
1512,"Military service, deployments, and exposures in relation to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis survival BACKGROUND: Military veterans may have higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mortality than non-veterans. Few studies, with sparse exposure information and mixed results, have studied relationships between military-related factors and ALS survival. We evaluated associations between military-related factors and ALS survival among U.S. military veteran cases. METHODS: We followed 616 medical record-confirmed cases from enrollment (2005-2010) in the Genes and Environmental Exposures in Veterans with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis study until death or July 25, 2013, whichever came first. We ascertained vital status information from several sources within the Department of Veterans Affairs. We obtained information regarding military service, deployments, and 39 related exposures via standardized telephone interviews. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals. We adjusted for potential confounding and missing covariate data biases via inverse probability weights. We also used inverse probability weights to adjust for potential selection bias among a case group that included a disproportionate number of long-term survivors at enrollment. RESULTS: We observed 446 deaths during 24,267 person-months of follow-up (median follow-up: 28 months). Survival was shorter for cases who served before 1950, were deployed to World War II, or mixed and applied burning agents, with HRs between 1.58 and 2.57. Longer survival was associated with exposure to: paint, solvents, or petrochemical substances; local food not provided by the Armed Forces; or burning agents or Agent Orange in the field with HRs between 0.56 and 0.73. CONCLUSIONS: Although most military-related factors were not associated with survival, associations we observed with shorter survival are potentially important because of the large number of military veterans.",,,9,,,
1513,"Biomarker-predicted sugars intake compared with self-reported measures in US Hispanics/Latinos: results from the HCHS/SOL SOLNAS study OBJECTIVE: Measurement error in self-reported total sugars intake may obscure associations between sugars consumption and health outcomes, and the sum of 24 h urinary sucrose and fructose may serve as a predictive biomarker of total sugars intake. DESIGN: The Study of Latinos: Nutrition & Physical Activity Assessment Study (SOLNAS) was an ancillary study to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) cohort. Doubly labelled water and 24 h urinary sucrose and fructose were used as biomarkers of energy and sugars intake, respectively. Participants' diets were assessed by up to three 24 h recalls (88 % had two or more recalls). Procedures were repeated approximately 6 months after the initial visit among a subset of ninety-six participants. SETTING: Four centres (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; San Diego, CA) across the USA. SUBJECTS: Men and women (n 477) aged 18-74 years. RESULTS: The geometric mean of total sugars was 167_5 (95 % CI 154_4, 181_7) g/d for the biomarker-predicted and 90_6 (95 % CI 87_6, 93_6) g/d for the self-reported total sugars intake. Self-reported total sugars intake was not correlated with biomarker-predicted sugars intake (r=-0_06, P=0_20, n 450). Among the reliability sample (n 90), the reproducibility coefficient was 0_59 for biomarker-predicted and 0_20 for self-reported total sugars intake. CONCLUSIONS: Possible explanations for the lack of association between biomarker-predicted and self-reported sugars intake include measurement error in self-reported diet, high intra-individual variability in sugars intake, and/or urinary sucrose and fructose may not be a suitable proxy for total sugars intake in this study population.",,,4,,,
1514,"Household management of childhood diarrhoea: A population-based study in Nicaragua Diarrhoea remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity among children in Nicaragua. As the majority of diarrhoeal cases are treated at home and appropriate household management can lessen severity of diarrhoea, the objective of this study was to examine household management of childhood diarrhoea. A simple random sample of households was selected from the Health and Demographic Surveillance Site-Le_n. Parents or caretakers of children below five years of age, who developed diarrhoea (n=232), were surveyed about household diarrhoea management practices in 2011. Fifty-seven percent of children received oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in the home prior to visiting any health facility. We encountered certain practices in contradiction with WHO recommendations for the management of diarrhoea in communities: 41% of children were offered protein-rich foods less frequently during diarrhoeal episodes, 20% of children were nursed less frequently or not at all during diarrhoeal episodes, and zinc supplementation was recommended at only 39% of visits with healthcare providers. Our findings provide insights for efforts to improve the household management of childhood diarrhoea in Nicaragua. _ International Centre For Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.",,,1,,,
1515,"Gut microbiome composition in young nicaraguan children during diarrhea episodes and recovery Understanding how the gut microbiota is affected by diarrhea episodes may help explain alterations in intestinal function among children in low-income settings. This study examined the composition of the gut microbiome of Nicaraguan children both during diarrhea episodes and while free of diarrhea for at least 2 months. Relative abundances of bacterial taxa, phylogenetic diversity, and species richness were determined by 16S amplicon sequencing and compared between paired diarrhea and recovery samples. A total of 66 stools were provided by 25 children enrolled in a 1-year cohort study of diarrhea etiologies. Children in our cohort had a mean age of 21.9 months; 64% were breast-fed, and 10% had received an antibiotic during the diarrhea episode. Overall, phylogenetic diversity and species richness did not differ significantly between diarrhea and recovery stools. However, of children who had a bacterial enteropathogen detected in any diarrhea stool, none experienced an increase in phylogenetic diversity in recovery, whereas of those in whom no bacterial enteropathogens were detected in their diarrhea stool(s), 59% experienced an increase in phylogenetic diversity in recovery (P = 0.008). This preliminary study suggests that recovery of the gut microbiota after a diarrhea episode may take longer time than previously thought and may be pathogen specific. _ The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",,,1,,,
1516,"Impact of a combined pediatric and adult pneumococcal immunization program on adult pneumonia incidence and mortality in Nicaragua BACKGROUND: In 2010, Nicaragua implemented an adult immunization program with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23) and a pediatric immunization program with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13). We assessed incidence rates of ambulatory visits and hospitalizations for pneumonia and pneumonia-related mortality in adults over the age of 50 years before and after the program's implementation in the Department of Le_n, Nicaragua. METHODS: We collected visit diagnoses from all 107 public health facilities between 2008 and 2012 in Le_n. We compared incidence rates of ambulatory visits for pneumonia, pneumonia hospitalizations, and pneumonia-related mortality in the pre-vaccine (2008-2009) and vaccine (2011-2012) periods among older adults using Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE), controlling for age group, municipality, and proportions of adults who were immunized against influenza. Exposure time was estimated by official municipality population estimates. RESULTS: We did not observe lower incidence rates of ambulatory visits or hospitalizations for pneumonia among adults during the vaccine period versus the pre-vaccine period. However, pneumonia-related mortality was lower in the vaccine period versus the pre-vaccine period, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRRa) of 0.73 (0.56, 0.94) among adults aged 50-64 years, and 0.55 (0.43, 0.70) among adults aged _65 years. CONCLUSIONS: These early results following introduction of a combined pediatric and adult pneumococcal immunization program in Nicaragua show a probable impact of the program on the reduction of pneumonia-related deaths in older adults, but a less clear impact on the reduction of health facility visits for pneumonia.

1517,"Etiology of childhood diarrhea after rotavirus vaccine introduction: a prospective, population-based study in Nicaragua BACKGROUND: Nicaragua was the first developing nation to implement routine immunization with the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5). In this RV5-immunized population, understanding infectious etiologies of childhood diarrhea is necessary to direct diarrhea treatment and prevention efforts. METHODS: We followed a population-based sample of children < 5 years in Le_n, Nicaragua for diarrhea episodes through household visits. Information was obtained on RV5 history and sociodemographics. Stool samples collected during diarrhea episodes and among healthy children underwent laboratory analysis for viral, bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens. Detection frequency and incidence of each enteropathogen was calculated. RESULTS: The 826 children in the cohort experienced 677 diarrhea episodes during 607.5 child-years of exposure time (1.1 episodes per child-year). At least 1 enteropathogen was detected among 61.1% of the 337 diarrheal stools collected. The most common enteropathogens among diarrheal stools were: norovirus (20.4%), sapovirus (16.6%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (11.3%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (8.3%), Giardia lamblia (8.0%) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (7.7%), with rotavirus detected among 5.3% of diarrheal stools. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli were frequently detected among stools from healthy children. Among children with diarrhea, norovirus was more commonly detected among younger children (< 2 years) and G. lamblia was more commonly detected among older children (2-4 years). The mean age of rotavirus detection was 34.6 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this Central American community after RV5 introduction, rotavirus was not commonly detected among children with diarrhea. Prevention and appropriate management of norovirus and sapovirus should be considered to further reduce the burden of diarrheal disease.",,,1,,,

1520,"Environmental factors associated with childhood norovirus diarrhoea in Le_n, Nicaragua Norovirus is detected in one in five diarrhoea episodes in children, yet little is known about environmental risk factors associated with this disease, especially in low-income settings. The objective of this study was to examine environmental risk factors, and spatial and seasonal patterns of norovirus diarrhoea episodes in children in Le_n, Nicaragua. We followed a population-based cohort of children under age 5 years for norovirus diarrhoea over a 1-year period. At baseline, characteristics of each household were recorded. Households were geocoded and spatial locations of garbage dumps, rivers, and markets were collected. In bivariate analysis we observed younger children and those with animals in their households were more likely to have experienced norovirus episodes. In adjusted models, younger children remained at higher risk for norovirus episodes, but only modest associations were observed with family and environmental characteristics. We next identified symptomatic children living in the same household and within 500 m buffer zones around the household of another child infected with the same genotype. Norovirus diarrhoea episodes peaked early in the rainy season. These findings contribute to our understanding of environmental factors and norovirus infection.",,,3,,,

1522,"Changes in childhood diarrhea incidence in nicaragua following 3 years of universal infant rotavirus immunization BACKGROUND: Although the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine was highly efficacious against rotavirus diarrhea in clinical trials, the effectiveness of vaccine under field conditions in the developing world is unclear. In October 2006, Nicaragua became the first developing nation to implement universal infant immunization with the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine. To assess the effect of the immunization program, we examined the incidence of diarrhea episodes between 2003 and 2009 among children in the state of Le_n, Nicaragua. METHODS: We extracted data on diarrhea episodes from health ministry records. We used scaled Poisson regression models to estimate diarrhea incidence rate ratios for the period following the program's implementation to the period before implementation. RESULTS: Following implementation of the immunization program, diarrhea episodes among infants were reduced (incidence rate ratios: 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.71-1.02) during the rotavirus season, but appear to have increased during other months. CONCLUSIONS: Although the immunization program appears effective in reducing diarrhea episodes during the rotavirus season, a large burden of diarrhea still persists during the remainder of the year.",,,1,,,
1523,"Rotavirus prevalence in the primary care setting in Nicaragua after universal infant rotavirus immunization Nicaragua was the first developing nation to implement universal infant rotavirus immunization with the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5). Initial studies of vaccine effectiveness in Nicaragua and other developing nations have focused on the prevention of hospitalizations and severe rotavirus diarrhea. However, rotavirus diarrhea is more commonly treated in the primary care setting, with only 1-3% of rotavirus cases receiving hospital care. We measured the prevalence of rotavirus infection in primary care clinics in Le_n, Nicaragua, after introduction of the immunization program. In the post-vaccine period, 3.5% (95% confidence interval = 1.9-5.8) of children seeking care for diarrhea tested positive for rotavirus. A high diversity of rotavirus genotypes was encountered among the few positive samples. In conclusion, rotavirus was an uncommon cause of childhood diarrhea in this primary care setting after implementation of a rotavirus immunization program.",,,1,,,
1524,"The association between fecal biomarkers of environmental enteropathy and rotavirus vaccine response in nicaraguan infants BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a common intestinal condition among children living in low- and middle-income countries and is associated with diminished enteric immunity to gastrointestinal pathogens, and possibly to oral vaccine antigens. The goal of this study was to examine associations between biomarkers of EE and immunogenicity to the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5). METHODS: Infants were recruited 1 day before their first RV5 immunization in Le_n, Nicaragua, from public health rosters. Infants provided a preimmunization blood and stool sample, and a second blood sample 1 month after receipt of RV5. We measured immunoglobin A (IgA) seroconversion to the first dose of RV5 and concentrations of 4 previously identified fecal biomarkers of EE (alpha-1 antitrypsin, neopterin, myeloperoxidase and calprotectin). We then assessed associations between concentrations of these biomarkers, both individually and as combined scores, and seroconversion to the first dose of RV5. RESULTS: Of the 43 enrolled infants, 24 (56%) seroconverted after the first dose of RV5. As compared with infants who seroconverted, those who did not seroconvert had higher median concentrations of both myeloperoxidase (3.1 vs. 1.1 _g/mL, P = 0.002) and calprotectin (199.1 vs. 156.2 _g/mL, P = 0.03). Further, those who did not seroconvert had a higher median combined score of the 4 biomarkers as compared with those who seroconverted (6.5 vs. 4.5, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between biomarkers of EE and seroconversion to the first dose of RV5. It is possible that interventions that prevent or ameliorate EE may also improve oral rotavirus vaccine response.",,,1,,,
1525,"Can a shift in the purchase of local foods by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients impact the local economy? In recent years, several initiatives have sought to encourage redemption of food assistance benefits at direct-to-consumer (DTC) market venues such as community supported agriculture programs and farmers_ markets in the USA, with the dual goal of increasing access to healthy foods for low-income families and sales of locally-grown foods for farmers. Proponents of these interventions assert that these programs have a positive impact on local economies yet there is limited evidence to validate this argument. This research project used a customized input-output model to simulate potential economic impacts of programs and policies that enable Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients to shift purchases from traditional food retailers to DTC venues in four states. Two different scenarios were explored: (1) increased outreach to low-income consumers and (2) financial support for using SNAP benefits at DTC market channels. We found a positive, though modest, economic impact at the state level under both scenarios when accounting for (a) business losses in the food retail and wholesale sectors, (b) a shift in acreage from commodity to specialty crops and (c) the cost to taxpayers. Since most of the increased economic activity would be in the produce farming sector, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for this sector along with potential policy implications.",,,1,,,

Repeated measures regression analysis showed a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms for intervention mothers compared to the usual care group at 22 and 26 weeks (4 weeks post intervention). Intervention mothers' reports of their child's aggression diminished significantly from T1 to T4 compared to usual care mothers (p = .03).

1528,"Parenting enhancement, interpersonal psychotherapy to reduce depression in low-income mothers of infants and toddlers: a randomized trial BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms and clinical depression are highly prevalent in low-income mothers and negatively affect their infants and toddlers. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test interpersonal psychotherapy combined with parenting enhancement on depressive symptoms and parenting behavior, compared with an equal attention-control condition. METHODS: Mothers (n = 226) of Early Head Start infants and toddlers from the southeastern and northeastern United States were randomized to the intervention delivered in-home by psychiatric mental health advanced practice nurses or an equal attention-control condition delivered by generalist nurses. Rigorous clinical depressive symptom and depression assessments and videotaped, coded mother-child interactions were used as baseline and 14-, 22-, and 26-week postintervention measures. RESULTS: Both the intervention and control groups had significantly reduced Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores at each subsequent time point compared with baseline (p < .0001). However, only mothers receiving the intervention showed a significant increase in positive involvement with their child, as measured by closeness, positive effect, affection, and warm touch at T4 (t = 2.22, df = 156, p < .03). DISCUSSION: Both intervention and control conditions resulted in symptom reduction, but only the intervention mothers showed significant interaction changes with their child, an essential step in reducing the negative child outcomes associated with maternal depressive symptoms. Results suggest that a combination of generalist and specialist nurses could be used to treat depressive symptoms in these mothers. Further study with longer postintervention observation is needed to see if, over time, the intervention led to longer-lasting symptom reduction.",,,1,,,
1529,"Depressive symptoms and compromised parenting in low-income mothers of infants and toddlers: distal and proximal risks Low-income mothers develop depressive symptoms at higher rates than the general population, adding to the existing risk that economic hardship places on their infants and toddlers. Emphasizing a few key intervention targets, an approach that is especially relevant to mothers when depressive symptoms compromise their energy and concentration, can improve interventions with populations facing adversity. The goal of this study was to identify contextual risk factors that significantly contributed to depressive symptoms and that, in combination with depressive symptoms, were associated with compromised parenting. Using baseline data from 251 ethnically diverse mothers from six Early Head Start programs in the Northeastern and Southeastern US, who were recruited for a clinical trial of an in-home intervention, Belsky's ecological framework of distal to proximal levels of influence was used to organize risk factors for depressive symptoms in hierarchical regression models. Under stress, mothers of toddlers reported more severe depressive symptoms than mothers of infants, supporting the need for depressive symptom screening and monitoring past the immediate postpartum period. Multivariate models revealed intervention targets that can focus depression prevention and intervention efforts, including helping mothers reduce chronic day-to-day stressors and conflicts with significant others, and to effectively handle challenging toddler behaviors, especially in the face of regional disciplinary norms. Presence of a live-in partner was linked to more effective parenting, regardless of participants' depressive symptom severity. _ 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,1,,,

The objective of this study is to present the costs associated with a comprehensive intervention in ASPs. Intervention delivery inputs (IDIs) associated with a group randomized delayed treatment controlled trial involving 20 ASPs serving >1700 children (5-12yrs) were catalogued prospectively across 2-years (2014-2015). IDIs, analyzed 2015, were expressed as increases in per-child per-week enrollment fees based on a 34-week school year in US$. Total IDIs for year-1 were $15,058 (+$0.58/child/week enrollment fee). In year-2, total costs were $13,828 (+$0.52/child/week) for the delayed group and $7916 (+$0.30/child/week) for the immediate group, respectively. Site leader and staff hourly wages represented 11-17% and 45-46% of initial training costs; travel and trainer wages represented 31-42% and 50-58% of booster costs.

1532,"Salty or sweet? Nutritional quality, consumption, and cost of snacks served in afterschool programs BACKGROUND: Snacks served in afterschool programs (ASPs, 3-6 pm) represent an important opportunity to promote healthy eating. ASP policies suggest a fruit/vegetable is served daily, while sugar-sweetened foods/beverages and artificially flavored snacks are eliminated. Limited information exists on the types of snacks served in ASPs, if snacks meet existing nutrition policies, whether children eat the snacks, and their cost. METHODS: Direct observation of snacks served and consumed was collected in 20 ASPs serving over 1700 elementary age children. The number of days that snacks were served/week was evaluated for compliance with nutrition policies. Costs of snacks were collected via receipts. RESULTS: Programs served desserts and artificially flavored salty snacks on 2.7 and 2.1 days/week. Fruits and vegetables were served 0.6 and 0.1 days/week, respectively. Sugar-sweetened beverages were served 1.8 days/week. Of the children (N = 383) observed, 75% to 100% consumed the snack served, with 95% and 100% of served fruits/vegetables consumed. No ASP served fruit/vegetables daily, 18 served sugar-sweetened foods, 16 served artificially flavored snacks, and 14 served sugar-sweetened beverages. Desserts and salty snacks cost $0.27-$0.32/snack vs $0.38-$0.40/snack for vegetables/fruits.

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Twenty ASPs serving 1,700 children (aged 5-12 years) were recruited, with baseline occurring spring 2013, and outcome assessment occurring spring 2014 and 2015. INTERVENTION: The multistep intervention, Strategies To Enhance Practice for Healthy Eating, assisted ASP leaders/staff to serve foods/beverages that meet the nutrition standards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The foods and beverages served for snack were observed directly. RESULTS: Compared with non-intervention years, both the immediate and delayed groups increased the number of days/week that fruits/vegetables (0.6 vs 1.7 days/week and 0.6 vs 4.4 days/week, OR=3.80, 95% CI=1.45, 9.95) and water (2.3 vs 3.7 days/week and 2.7 vs 4.8 days/week, OR=4.65, 95% CI=1.69, 12.79) were served. Sugar-sweetened beverages were almost eliminated by post-assessment (1.2 vs 0.2 days/week and 3.2 vs 0.0 days/week, OR=0.05, 95% CI=0.02, 0.13). Only the immediate group decreased the number of days/week desserts were served (2.9 vs 0.6 days/week, OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.03, 0.33). Implementation barriers for the delayed group included once/month delivery schedules for fruits/vegetables and limited storage space for foods meeting the Healthy Eating Standards. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the foods/beverages served in ASPs can be made, yet were hindered by structural barriers related to procurement and storage of perishable foods. Additional efforts are needed to support ASPs as they work toward fully achieving the Healthy Eating Standards. Copyright _ 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1534,"Making Healthy Eating Policy Practice: A Group Randomized Controlled Trial on Changes in Snack Quality, Costs, and Consumption in After-School Programs PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate an intervention designed to assist after-school programs (ASPs) in meeting snack nutrition policies that specify that a fruit or vegetable be served daily and sugar-sweetened beverages/foods and artificially flavored foods eliminated. DESIGN: The study used a 1-year group-randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The study took place in ASPs operating in South Carolina, United States. SUBJECTS: Twenty ASPs serving over 1700 children were recruited, match-paired postbaseline on enrollment size and days fruits/vegetables were served per week, and randomized to either intervention (n = 10) or control (n = 10) groups. INTERVENTION: The study used Strategies To Enhance Practice for Healthy Eating (STEPs-HE), a multistep adaptive intervention framework that assists ASP leaders and staff to serve snacks that meet nutrition policies while maintaining cost. MEASURES: Direct observation of snacks served and consumed and monthly snack expenditures as determined by receipts were used. ANALYSIS: The study used nonparametric and mixed-model repeated measures. RESULTS: By postassessment, intervention ASPs increased serving of fruits/vegetables to 3.9 _ 2.1 vs. 0.7 _ 1.7 d/wk and decreased serving sugar-sweetened beverages to 0.1 _ 0.7 vs. 1.8 _ 2.4 d/wk and sugar-sweetened foods to 0.3 _ 1.1 vs. 2.7 _ 2.5 d/wk compared to controls, respectively. Cost of snacks increased by $0.02/snack in the intervention ASPs ($0.36 to $0.38) compared to a $0.01 per snack decrease in the control group ($0.39 to $0.38). Across both assessments and groups, 80% to 100% of children consumed FVs. CONCLUSIONS: The STEPs-HE intervention can assist ASPs in meeting nationally endorsed nutrition policies with marginal increases in cost. _ 2016 by American Journal of Health Promotion, Inc.",,,4,,,
1535,"Making policy practice in afterschool programs: a randomized controlled trial on physical activity changes INTRODUCTION: In the U.S., afterschool programs are asked to promote moderate to vigorous physical activity. One policy that has considerable public health importance is California's afterschool physical activity guidelines that indicate all children attending an afterschool program accumulate 30 minutes each day the program is operating. Few effective strategies exist for afterschool programs to meet this policy goal. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a multistep adaptive intervention designed to assist afterschool programs in meeting the 30-minute/day moderate to vigorous physical activity policy goal. DESIGN: A 1-year group randomized controlled trial with baseline (spring 2013) and post-assessment (spring 2014). Data were analyzed 2014. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Twenty afterschool programs, serving >1,700 children (aged 6-12 years), randomized to either an intervention (n=10) or control (n=10) group. INTERVENTION: The employed framework, Strategies To Enhance Practice, focused on intentional programming of physical activity opportunities in each afterschool program's daily schedule and included professional development training to establish core physical activity competencies of staff and afterschool program leaders with ongoing technical assistance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was accelerometry-derived proportion of children meeting the 30-minute/day moderate to vigorous physical activity policy. RESULTS: Children attending intervention afterschool programs had an OR of 2.37 (95% CI=1.58, 3.54) to achieve the physical activity policy at post-assessment compared to control afterschool programs. Sex-specific models indicated that the percentage of intervention girls and boys achieving the physical activity policy increased from 16.7% to 21.4% (OR=2.85, 95% CI=1.43, 5.68) and 34.2% to 41.6% (OR=2.26, 95% CI=1.35, 3.80), respectively. At post-assessment, six intervention afterschool programs increased the proportion of boys achieving the physical activity policy to _45% compared to one control afterschool program, whereas three intervention afterschool programs increased the proportion of girls achieving physical activity policy to _30% compared to no control afterschool programs. CONCLUSIONS: The Strategies To Enhance Practice intervention can make meaningful changes in the proportion of children meeting the moderate to vigorous physical activity policy within one school year. Additional efforts are required to enhance the impact of the intervention. Copyright _ 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,9,,,
1536,"Physical activity outcomes in afterschool programs: A group randomized controlled trial INTRODUCTION: Afterschool programs (ASPs) across the US are working towards achieving the standard of all children accumulating 30min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during program time. This study describes the two-year impact of an intervention designed to assist ASPs meeting the 30min/day MVPA standard. METHODS: Using a two-year delayed treatment, group randomized controlled trial, 20 ASPs serving ~1700 children/year (6-12yrs) were randomized to either an immediate (n=10, baseline-2013 and 2yrs intervention fall-2013-to-spring-2015) or delayed group (n=10, baseline 2013-2014 and 1yr intervention fall-2014-to-spring-2015). The intervention, Strategies-To-Enhance-Practice (STEPs), focused on programming MVPA in the daily schedule, training of staff and leaders, and ongoing technical support/assistance. Accelerometry-derived proportion of children meeting the 30min/day MVPA standard was measured in the spring of each year. Mixed model logistic regressions were used to examine the change in the odds of achieving the MVPA standard. Analyses were conducted in 2015. Data were collected in one southeastern US state. RESULTS: Immediate boys (n=677) and delayed girls (n=658) increased the percent achieving 30min MVPA/day from 35.9% to 47.0% (odds ratio [OR]=1.88, 95% CI 1.18-3.00) and 13.1% to 19.1% (OR=1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.96). Immediate girls (n=613) and delayed boys (n=687) exhibited a nonsignificant increase from 19.1% to 21.6% (OR=1.20, 95% CI 0.84-1.72) and 29.0% to 31.3% (OR=1.13, 95%CI 0.80-1.58). CONCLUSIONS: STEPs can have an impact on children's MVPA and time spent sedentary, yet was unable to fully achieve the goal of all children accumulating 30minMVPA/day.

1537,"A Qualitative, Systems Thinking Approach to Study Self-Management in Women With Migraine BACKGROUND: A dearth of effective and affordable treatment options has rendered nonpharmacological self-management a crucial part of living with migraine-a debilitating neurobiological condition without cure that disproportionately disables vulnerable women. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the development and use of a systems thinking, problem-structuring data collection approach that was applied to the study of migraine self-management with women in diverse social locations. METHODS: Two systems mapping activities were developed for use in focus groups: one to unpack a migraine episode (system support map) and the other (connection circle [CC]) to construct a mental model of self-management. Later in the process, a strengths-based problem-solving tool was developed to replace the CC. RESULTS: The CCs-often enlightening for affluent participants-left marginalized women feeling overwhelmed and defeated, as a solution to one challenge became the cause of another. Through constant comparison analysis, we recalibrated the approach using a theory, clinical experience, and participant feedback and replaced the CC with a strengths-based problem-solving activity highlighting relationships and trade-offs in a more agential, actionable way. DISCUSSION: Bringing a critical lens and strengths-based approaches to work with vulnerable populations can replace traditional deficit thinking in healthcare, developing options for leveraging resources and understanding complex health behaviors without losing sight of systemic, distributional justice issues. These systems thinking tools can provide a way to extrapolate the complexities of actual self-management behaviors and challenges faced by vulnerable women with migraine versus what they may be instructed to do by a medical model that does not always account for the social and structural determinants of equity and health.",,,7,,,
1538,"Metabolomics enables precision medicine: ""A White Paper, Community Perspective"" INTRODUCTION_BACKGROUND TO METABOLOMICS: Metabolomics is the comprehensive study of the metabolome, the repertoire of biochemicals (or small molecules) present in cells, tissues, and body fluids. The study of metabolism at the global or ""-omics"" level is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to have a profound impact upon medical practice. At the center of metabolomics, is the concept that a person's metabolic state provides a close representation of that individual's overall health status. This metabolic state reflects what has been encoded by the genome, and modified by diet, environmental factors, and the gut microbiome. The metabolic profile provides a quantifiable readout of biochemical state from normal physiology to diverse pathophysiologies in a manner that is often not obvious from gene expression analyses. Today, clinicians capture only a very small part of the information contained in the metabolome, as they routinely measure only a narrow set of blood chemistry analytes to assess health and disease states. Examples include measuring glucose to monitor diabetes, measuring cholesterol and high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein ratio to assess cardiovascular health, BUN and creatinine for renal disorders, and measuring a panel of metabolites to diagnose potential inborn errors of metabolism in neonates. OBJECTIVES_OF WHITE PAPER__XPECTED TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND_METABOLOMICS_ENABLING TOOL FOR PRECISION MEDICINE: We anticipate that the narrow range of chemical analyses in current use by the medical community today will be replaced in the future by analyses that reveal a far more comprehensive metabolic signature. This signature is expected to describe global biochemical aberrations that reflect patterns of variance in states of wellness, more accurately describe specific diseases and their progression, and greatly aid in differential diagnosis. Such future metabolic signatures will: (1) provide predictive, prognostic, diagnostic, and surrogate markers of diverse disease states; (2) inform on underlying molecular mechanisms of diseases; (3) allow for sub-classification of diseases, and stratification of patients based on metabolic pathways impacted; (4) reveal biomarkers for drug response phenotypes, providing an effective means to predict variation in a subject's response to treatment (pharmacometabolomics); (5) define a metabotype for each specific genotype, offering a functional read-out for genetic variants: (6) provide a means to monitor response and recurrence of diseases, such as cancers: (7) describe the molecular landscape in human performance applications and extreme environments. Importantly, sophisticated metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools have recently been developed that make it possible to measure thousands of metabolites in blood, other body fluids, and tissues. Such tools also enable more robust analysis of response to treatment. New insights have been gained about mechanisms of diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and a range of pathologies. A series of ground breaking studies supported by National Institute of Health (NIH) through the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network and its partnership with the Pharmacogenomics Research Network illustrate how a patient's metabotype at baseline, prior to treatment, during treatment, and post-treatment, can inform about treatment outcomes and variations in responsiveness to drugs (e.g., statins, antidepressants, antihypertensives and antiplatelet therapies). These studies along with several others also exemplify how metabolomics data can complement and inform genetic data in defining ethnic, sex, and gender basis for variation in responses to treatment, which illustrates how pharmacometabolomics and pharmacogenomics are complementary and powerful tools for precision medicine. CONCLUSIONS_KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRECISION MEDICINE: Our metabolomics community believes that inclusion of metabolomics data in precision medicine initiative is timely and will provide an extremely valuable layer of data that compliments and informs other data obtained by these important initiatives. Our Metabolomics Society, through its ""Precision Medicine and Pharmacometabolomics Task Group"", with input from our metabolomics community at large, has developed this White Paper where we discuss the value and approaches for including metabolomics data in large precision medicine initiatives. This White Paper offers recommendations for the selection of state of-the-art metabolomics platforms and approaches that offer the widest biochemical coverage, considers critical sample collection and preservation, as well as standardization of measurements, among other important topics. We anticipate that our metabolomics community will have representation in large precision medicine initiatives to provide input with regard to sample acquisition/preservation, selection of optimal omics technologies, and key issues regarding data collection, interpretation, and dissemination. We strongly recommend the collection and biobanking of samples for precision medicine initiatives that will take into consideration needs for large-scale metabolic phenotyping studies.",,,1,,,
1539,"Heterogeneous and decreasing HIV prevalence among women seeking antenatal care in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo BACKGROUND: We examined HIV prevalence trends over 4.5 years among women receiving antenatal care in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, by geographic location, clinic management and urbanicity. METHODS: Quarterly proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of pregnant women with HIV positive results were determined using aggregate service provision and uptake data from 22 maternity units that provided vertical HIV prevention services from October 2004 to March 2009. Assuming linearity, proportions were assessed for trend via the Cochran-Armitage test. Multivariable binomial regression was used to describe detailed prevalence trends. RESULTS: HIV testing was offered to 220,006 pregnant women; 210,348 (95.6%) agreed to be tested and 191,216 (90.9%) received their results. A total of 3999 women were found to be HIV positive, a prevalence of 1.90% (95% CI: 1.84-1.96%). The median quarterly proportion of women testing positive for HIV was 1.94% (range: 1.44-2.44%). Prevalence was heterogeneous in terms of maternity management, urbanicity and geographic location. Modeling suggested that the overall prevalence dropped from 2.04% (95% CI: 1.92-2.16%) to 1.77% (95% CI: 1.66-1.88%) over 4.5 years, a relative decrease of 13.2% (95% CI: 3.53-22.9%). Trend testing corroborated this decline (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The decreasing HIV prevalence among Kinshasa antenatal care seekers is robust and encouraging. The relatively low prevalence and the weak existing healthcare system require prevention of mother-to-child transmission interventions that strengthen maternal and child healthcare service delivery. Complacency would be unwarranted: assuming a uniform national crude birth rate of 50/1000 and 1.8% antenatal HIV prevalence, approximately 7000 pregnant HIV infected women in Kinshasa, and 60,000 nationwide, are in need of care and prevention services yearly.",,,6,,,
1540,"Patient-physician agreement on the content of CHD prevention discussions BACKGROUND: Little is known about agreement between patients and physicians on content and outcomes of clinical discussions. A common perception of content and outcomes may be desirable to optimize decision making and clinical care. OBJECTIVE: To determine patient-physician agreement on content and outcomes of coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention discussions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey nested within a randomized CHD prevention study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: University internal medicine clinic; 24 physicians and 157 patients. METHODS: Following one clinic visit, we surveyed patients and physicians on discussion content, decision making and final decisions about CHD prevention. For comparison, we audio-recorded, transcribed and coded 20 patient-physician visits. We calculated percent agreement between patient/physician reports, patient/transcription reports and physician/transcription reports. We calculated Cohen's kappas to compare patient/physician perspectives. RESULTS: Patients and physicians agreed on whether CHD was discussed in 130 visits (83%; kappa = 0.55; 95% CI 0.40-0.70). When discussions occurred, they agreed about discussion content (pros versus cons) in 53% of visits (kappa = 0.15; 95% CI -0.01-0.30) and physicians' recommendations in 73% (kappa = 0.44; 95% CI 0.28-0.66). Patients and physicians agreed on final decisions to take medication in 78% (kappa = 0.58; 95% CI 0.45-0.71) and change lifestyle in 69% (kappa = 0.38; 95% CI 0.24-0.53). They agreed less often, 43% (kappa = 0.13; 95% CI -0.11-0.37) about degree of involvement in decision making. Audio-recorded results were similar, but showed very low agreement between transcripts and patients' and physicians' self-report on discussion content and decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Disagreements about clinical discussions and decision making may be common. Future work is needed to determine: how widespread such agreements are; whether they impact clinical outcomes; and the relative importance of the subjective experience versus objective steps of shared decision making. _ 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,0,,,

1542,"Cost-effectiveness of alternative treatments for depression in low-income women BACKGROUND: Low-income mothers are more likely to experience depressive symptoms than their higher income counterparts, but they are less likely to receive treatment. One way to overcome common barriers to care for low-income women is to do therapy in the mother's home. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of in-home interpersonal therapy (IPT) to two standard therapies for depression treatment: office based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychotropic medication. METHODS: This cost utility analysis used a Markov model with a 3-year time horizon to compare the cost-effectiveness of the alternate therapies from the public payer perspective. We followed a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 women age 19 to 35 years with depressive symptoms who had an income level at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Costs were based on the number of women who completed the therapy. We used data from published literature on clinical trials with low-income minority women to determine the completion rates, duration, and effectiveness of each type of therapy. Additionally, costs for in-home IPT were calculated from unpublished trial data. Costs were determined using 2011 North Carolina Medicaid reimbursement rates; utility weights were taken from published literature. The endpoint was the total outpatient medical cost (therapy and outpatient medical visits). The study outcomes were depression free days (DFD), which were translated into quality of adjusted life years (QALY). We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each therapy based on the number of QALYs gained. We conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to determine how robust the results were to uncertainty in the parameters. RESULTS: Treating patients with IPT resulted in an ICER of USD 13,479/QALY and USD 29,309/QALY as compared to CBT and medications, respectively. The results were most sensitive to the efficacy of IPT. Simulations showed that, with a threshold of USD 50,000/QALY, IPT was cost-effective 95% and 78% of the time as compared to CBT and medications, respectively. If policy makers were willing to pay USD 50,000 per QALY, IPT had a 0.586 probability of being the cost-effective option relative to medication and in-office CBT. DISCUSSION: Due to higher completion rates, in-home IPT cost more but resulted in more QALYs gained than the other therapies. Our results indicated that in-home IPT was cost-effective as compared to office-based CBT and at least as cost-effective as medication therapy. The analysis was based on limited data because there have been few randomized, controlled studies on treatments for depression in low-income women, however; additional studies are needed to improve the accuracy of the model. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: In coming years, the number of low-income women covered by public insurance should increase due to the Affordable Care Act. Given the high prevalence of depression in this population, it will be important to consider the value of potential resources spent on depression treatments. This study found that both in-home IPT and medication could be cost-effective treatments for depression. The results of this study support public payers reimbursing for in-home services.",,,6,,,
1543,"Accuracy of record linkage software in merging dental administrative data sets OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of record matching using ""Link King"" software that uses an ordinal score for the certainty that linked records are valid matches. METHODS: We linked records in North Carolina Medicaid files to public health surveillance files using Link King matching software. We selected a stratified random sample of 230 of 45,295 linked records and 50 of 35,119 non-linked surveillance records, then manually reviewed the records. Sensitivity (Sn) and Specificity (Sp) were calculated based on each cut point of the Link King score, using manual review as the gold standard. RESULTS: The Sn increased from 0.837 (95% CI: 0.785, 0.892) to 0.935 (0.879, 0.994) and Sp decreased from 0.893 (0.816, 0.976) to 0.865 (0.790, 0.947) as cut points were varied to widen the scope of declared matches. With a goal of both Sn and Sp being large, accuracy was best when linked record pairs from the top three levels of certainty were included in the match. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a publicly available software program accurately merged Medicaid and surveillance data. The Link King could be useful to researchers in merging administrative databases. _ 2012 American Association of Public Health Dentistry.",,,6,,,
1544,"Effect of early preventive dental visits on subsequent dental treatment and expenditures OBJECTIVE: Professional organizations recommend a preventive dental visit by 1 year of age. This study compared dental treatment and expenditures for Medicaid children who have a preventive visit before the age of 18 months with those who have a visit at age 18-42 months. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used reimbursement claims for 19,888 children enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid (1999-2006). We compared the number of dental treatment procedures at age 43-72 months for children who had a visit by age 18 months with children who had a visit at ages 18-24, 25-30, 31-36, and 37-42 months using a zero-inflated negative binomial model. The likelihood and amount of expenditures at age 43-72 months were compared by group using a logit and ordinary least squares regression. RESULTS: Children who had a primary or secondary preventive visit by age 18 months had no difference in subsequent dental outcomes compared with children in older age categories. Among children with existing disease, those who had a tertiary preventive visit by age 18 months had lower rates of subsequent treatment [18-24 mo incidence density ratio (IDR): 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.38; 25-30 mo IDR: 1.21, 95% CI, 1.06-1.39; 37-42 mo IDR: 1.39, 95% CI, 1.22-1.59] and lower treatment expenditures compared with children in older age categories. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of preventive dental users in Medicaid, we found that children at highest risk of dental disease benefited from a visit before the age of 18 months, but most children could delay their first visit until the age of 3 years without an effect on subsequent dental outcomes.",,,3,,,
1545,"Effects of early dental office visits on dental caries experience OBJECTIVES: We determined the association between timing of a first dentist office visit before age 5 years and dental disease in kindergarten. METHODS: We used North Carolina Medicaid claims (1999-2006) linked to state oral health surveillance data to compare caries experience for kindergarten students (2005-2006) who had a visit before age 60 months (n=11,394) to derive overall exposure effects from a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. We repeated the analysis separately for children who had preventive and tertiary visits. RESULTS: Children who had a visit at age 37 to 48 and 49 to 60 months had significantly less disease than children with a visit by age 24 months (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.81, 0.95; IRR=0.75; 95% CI=0.69, 0.82, respectively). Disease status did not differ between children who had a tertiary visit by age 24 months and other children. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid-enrolled children in our study followed an urgent care type of utilization, and access to dental care was limited. Children at high risk for dental disease should be given priority for a preventive dental visit before age 3 years.",,,3,,,
1546,"HIV and adolescents: focus on young key populations Adolescents and young adults are at increased risk for HIV due to the many developmental, psychological, social, and structural transitions that converge in this period of the lifespan. In addition, adolescent deaths resulting from HIV continue to rise despite declines in other age groups. There are also young key populations (YKPs) that bear disproportionate burdens of HIV and are the most vulnerable, including young men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender youth, young people who inject drugs, and adolescent and young adult sex workers. As a society, we must do more to stop new HIV infections and untimely HIV-related deaths through both primary and secondary prevention and better management approaches. Using an interwoven prevention and treatment cascade approach, the starting point for all interventions must be HIV counselling and testing. Subsequent interventions for both HIV-negative and HIV-positive youth must be __dolescent-centred,_ occur within the socio-ecological context of young people and take advantage of the innovations and technologies that youth have easily incorporated into their daily lives.

1547,"Echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function are associated with risk of atrial fibrillation in blacks: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study BACKGROUND: Several studies have examined the link between atrial fibrillation (AF) and various echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function in whites and other racial groups but not in blacks. Exploring AF risk factors in blacks is important given that the lower incidence of AF in this racial group despite higher risk factors, is not completely explained. METHODS: We examined the association of echocardiographic measures with AF incidence in 2283 blacks (64.5% women, mean age 58.8 years) free of diagnosed AF and enrolled in the Jackson cohort of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a prospective study of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography was performed in 1993-1995, and incident AF was determined by electrocardiograms at a follow-up study exam, hospitalization discharge codes and death certificates through the end of 2009. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for AF associated with the echocardiographic measures, adjusting for age, sex, and known AF risk factors. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 13.5 years, 191 (8.4%) individuals developed AF. Left ventricular (LV) internal diameter 2-D (diastole) and percent fractional shortening of LV diameter displayed a U-shaped relationship with risk of AF, while left atrial diameter displayed a J-shaped nonlinear association. LV mass index was associated positively with AF. E/A ratio < 0.7 or >1.5 and ejection fraction (EF < 50%) were also associated with higher AF risk. These measures improved risk stratification for AF in addition to traditional risk factors, although not significantly {C-statistic of 0.767 (0.714-0.819) vs. 0.744 (0.691-0.797)}. CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based population of blacks, echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function are significantly associated with an increased risk of AF.",,,3,,,
1548,"Genetic identification of a common collagen disease in puerto ricans via identity-by-descent mapping in a health system Achieving confidence in the causality of a disease locus is a complex task that often requires supporting data from both statistical genetics and clinical genomics. Here we describe a combined approach to identify and characterize a genetic disorder that leverages distantly related patients in a health system and population-scale mapping. We utilize genomic data to uncover components of distant pedigrees, in the absence of recorded pedigree information, in the multi-ethnic BioMe biobank in New York City. By linking to medical records, we discover a locus associated with both elevated genetic relatedness and extreme short stature. We link the gene, COL27A1, with a little-known genetic disease, previously thought to be rare and recessive. We demonstrate that disease manifests in both heterozygotes and homozygotes, indicating a common collagen disorder impacting up to 2% of individuals of Puerto Rican ancestry, leading to a better understanding of the continuum of complex and Mendelian disease.",,,8,,,
1549,"Impact of Medicare Part D on mental health treatment and outcomes for dual eligible beneficiaries with HIV Depression is common among women with HIV and untreated depression can result in poor quality of life and worsen HIV outcomes. Women with HIV who are dually enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare faced a potential disruption in medication access when Medicare Part D was implemented in 2006. The goal of this study was to estimate the effects of Medicare Part D implementation on antidepressant use, depressive symptoms, and hospitalization in Medicaid-Medicare dual eligible women with HIV. This study used 2003-2008 data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study. The effects of Medicare Part D were estimated using a difference-in-differences approach, adjusting for temporal trends using a matched control group of Medicaid-only enrollees. Before Medicare Part D implementation, dual eligibles differed from Medicaid-only enrollees in antidepressant use and hospitalization, despite having identical prescription drug coverage through Medicaid. For dual enrollees, the transition to Medicare Part D was not associated with changes in antidepressant use, depressive symptoms, or hospitalization. We did not find disruptive effects on antidepressant use and related outcomes among dual eligibles in this study. Stable antidepressant use may be due to better access to medical care for dual eligibles through Medicare both before and after Medicare Part D implementation, which may have eclipsed any effects of the transition. It may also signal that classification of antidepressants as a protected drug class under Medicare Part D was effective in preventing psychiatric medication disruption.",,,6,,,
1550,"Associations Between Medicare Part D and Out-of-Pocket Spending, HIV Viral Load, Adherence, and ADAP Use in Dual Eligibles With HIV BACKGROUND: The implementation of Medicare part D on January 1, 2006 required all adults who were dually enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare (dual eligibles) to transition prescription drug coverage from Medicaid to Medicare part D. Changes in payment systems and utilization management along with the loss of Medicaid protections had the potential to disrupt medication access, with uncertain consequences for dual eligibles with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who rely on consistent prescription coverage to suppress their HIV viral load (VL). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of Medicare part D on self-reported out-of-pocket prescription drug spending, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) use, antiretroviral adherence, and HIV VL suppression among dual eligibles with HIV. METHODS: Using 2003-2008 data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study, we created a propensity score-matched cohort and used a difference-in-differences approach to compare dual eligibles' outcomes pre-Medicare and post-Medicare part D to those enrolled in Medicaid alone. RESULTS: Transition to Medicare part D was associated with a sharp increase in the proportion of dual eligibles with self-reported out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, followed by an increase in ADAP use. Despite the increase in out-of-pocket costs, both adherence and HIV VL suppression remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare part D was associated with increased out-of-pocket spending, although the increased spending did not seem to compromise antiretroviral therapy adherence or HIV VL suppression. It is possible that increased ADAP use mitigated the increase in out-of-pocket spending, suggesting successful coordination between Medicare part D and ADAP as well as the vital role of ADAP during insurance transitions.",,,5,,,
1551,"Depressive symptoms, HIV medication adherence, and HIV clinical outcomes in Tanzania: a prospective, observational study Depressive symptoms have been shown to independently affect both antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and HIV clinical outcomes in high-income countries. We examined the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and adherence, virologic failure, and suppressed immune function in people living with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Data from 403 study participants who were on stable ART and engaged in HIV clinical care were analyzed. We assessed crude and adjusted associations of depressive symptoms and ART adherence, both at baseline and at 12 months, using logistic regression. We used logistic generalized estimating equations to assess the association and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between depressive symptoms and both virologic failure and suppressed immune function. Ten percent of participants reported moderate or severe depressive symptoms at baseline and 31% of participants experienced virologic failure (>150 copies/ml) over two years. Depressive symptoms were associated with greater odds of reported medication nonadherence at both baseline (Odds Ratio [OR] per 1-unit increase_=_1.18, 95% CI [1.12, 1.24]) and 12 months (OR_=_1.08, 95% CI [1.03, 1.14]). By contrast, increases in depressive symptom score were inversely related to both virologic failure (OR_=_0.93, 95% CI [0.87, 1.00]) and immune system suppression (OR_=_0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.99]), though the association between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes was less precise than for the association with nonadherence. Findings indicate a positive association between depressive symptoms and nonadherence, and also an inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes, possibly due to informative loss to follow-up.",,,6,,,
1552,"Pain modality- and sex-specific effects of COMT genetic functional variants The enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) metabolizes catecholamine neurotransmitters involved in a number of physiological functions, including pain perception. Both human and mouse COMT genes possess functional polymorphisms contributing to interindividual variability in pain phenotypes such as sensitivity to noxious stimuli, severity of clinical pain, and response to pain treatment. In this study, we found that the effects of Comt functional variation in mice are modality specific. Spontaneous inflammatory nociception and thermal nociception behaviors were correlated the most with the presence of the B2 SINE transposon insertion residing in the 3'UTR mRNA region. Similarly, in humans, COMT functional haplotypes were associated with thermal pain perception and with capsaicin-induced pain. Furthermore, COMT genetic variations contributed to pain behaviors in mice and pain ratings in humans in a sex-specific manner. The ancestral Comt variant, without a B2 SINE insertion, was more strongly associated with sensitivity to capsaicin in female vs male mice. In humans, the haplotype coding for low COMT activity increased capsaicin-induced pain perception in women, but not men. These findings reemphasize the fundamental contribution of COMT to pain processes, and provide a fine-grained resolution of this contribution at the genetic level that can be used to guide future studies in the area of pain genetics.

1553,"Prevalence of type-specific human papillomavirus in endocervical, upper and lower vaginal, perineal and vaginal self-collected specimens: Implications for vaginal self-collection To determine why a vaginal self-collection tested for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) by Hybrid Capture 2(R) (hc2) has lower sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2 or worse (> or = CIN 2), we collected 5 specimens (endocervix, upper and lower vagina, perineum, vaginal self-collection) from 2,625 women. Endocervical and self-collected specimens had HR-HPV tests by hc2. All 5 anogenital specimens were tested for 37 HPV genotypes [Linear Array(R), (LA)] from 397 women hc2 positive in endocervical or self-collected specimens and for a randomly selected 71 of 2,228 women hc2 negative on both specimens. Three hundred nintey-five women who screened positive by hc2 or had abnormal cytology underwent colposcopic evaluation. Of 47 women with > or = CIN 2, hc2 was positive in 97.9% (46/47) of endocervical and 80.9% (38/47), p = 0.008 of self-collected specimens. Seven of 9 women with > or = CIN 2 and negative self-collected hc2 tests were positive for HR-HPV by LA. Of 2,578 women without > or = CIN 2, hc2 was positive in 9.8% (253/2,578) of endocervical and 11.4% (294/2,578), p = 0.001 of self-collected specimens. Of the 41 more women without > or = CIN 2 that tested hc2 positive on the self-collected but negative on endocervical specimen, LA tested positive for HR-HPV in 24, negative for HPV in 11 and negative for HR-HPV but positive for low-risk HPV in 6. Lower sensitivity of self-collected specimens is secondary to lower levels of vaginal HR-HPV. The principal cause of the lower specificity of self-collected specimens is HR-HPV present solely in the vagina, which is not associated with > or = CIN 2.",,,0,,,
1554,"Jump-landing biomechanics and knee-laxity change across the menstrual cycle in women with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction CONTEXT: Of the individuals able to return to sport participation after an anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) injury, up to 25% will experience a second ACL injury. This population may be more sensitive to hormonal fluctuations, which may explain this high rate of second injury. OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in 3-dimensional hip and knee kinematics and kinetics during a jump landing and to examine knee laxity across the menstrual cycle in women with histories of unilateral noncontact ACL injury. DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 women (age = 19.6 _ 1.3 years, height = 168.6 _ 5.3 cm, mass = 66.2 _ 9.1 kg) with unilateral, noncontact ACL injuries. INTERVENTION(S): Participants completed a jump-landing task and knee-laxity assessment 3 to 5 days after the onset of menses and within 3 days of a positive ovulation test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Kinematics in the uninjured limb at initial contact with the ground during a jump landing, peak kinematics and kinetics during the loading phase of landing, anterior knee laxity via the KT-1000, peak vertical ground reaction force, and blood hormone concentrations (estradiol-_-17, progesterone, free testosterone). RESULTS: At ovulation, estradiol-_-17 (t = -2.9, P = .009), progesterone (t = -3.4, P = .003), and anterior knee laxity (t = -2.3, P = .03) increased, and participants presented with greater knee-valgus moment (Z = -2.6, P = .01) and femoral internal rotation (t = -2.1, P = .047). However, during the menses test session, participants landed harder (greater peak vertical ground reaction force; t = 2.2, P = .04), with the tibia internally rotated at initial contact (t = 2.8, P = .01) and greater hip internal-rotation moment (Z = -2.4, P = .02). No other changes were observed across the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Knee and hip mechanics in both phases of the menstrual cycle represented a greater potential risk of ACL loading. Observed changes in landing mechanics may explain why the risk of second ACL injury is elevated in this population.",,,9,,,
1555,"Estrogen and muscle stiffness have a negative relationship in females PURPOSE: Hormonal fluctuations are one potential reason why females might have a greater rate of noncontact ACL injury. The hamstrings are capable of limiting anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) loading. This study examined whether relationships existed between reproductive hormones (estradiol-_-17, free testosterone, and progesterone) and hamstring neuromechanical variables (hamstring musculotendinous stiffness (MTS), rate of force production (RFP), time to 50% peak torque (T50%), and electromechanical delay (EMD)) in genders combined and independently. METHODS: Muscle properties of the hamstrings and reproductive hormones were evaluated in 30 subjects (15 males and 15 females) that were free from lower extremity injury and had no history of ACL injury. Females were tested 3-5_days after the onset of menses and were not using oral contraceptive. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each hormone and muscle property. RESULTS: For genders combined, estrogen (mean_=_46.0___28.2_pg/mL) was negatively correlated with RFP (mean_=_758.8___507.6_N/kg_s(-1), r_=_-0.43, P_=_0.02) and MTS (mean_=_12.8___2.6_N/cm, r_=_-0.43, P_=_0.02). Free testosterone (mean_=_13.2___13.0_pg/mL) was positively correlated with RFP (r_=_0.56, P_< _0.01) and MTS (r_=_0.46, P_=_0.01) but negatively correlated with T50% (mean_=_114.7___38.9_ms, r_=_-0.43, P_=_0.02). When gender was considered separately, females demonstrated negative correlation between estrogen (mean_=_68.0___23.2_pg/mL) and MTS (mean_=_11.7___1.5_N/cm, r_=_-0.53, P_=_0.05) and free testosterone (mean_=_1.5___0.6_pg/mL) and MTS (r_=_-0.52, P_=_0.05). Males alone displayed no significant correlations between the selected hormones and muscle properties. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations exist between muscle properties and reproductive hormones. Females, however, may be more sensitive to reproductive hormones and their fluctuations.",,,4,,,
1556,"Case reduction and cost-effectiveness of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine alongside bed nets in Lilongwe, Malawi BACKGROUND: RTS,S/AS01, the most advanced vaccine against malaria, is now undergoing pilot implementation in Malawi, Ghana, and Kenya where an estimated 360,000 children will be vaccinated each year. In this study we evaluate RTS,S/AS01 alongside bed net use and estimate cost-effectiveness. METHODS: RTS,S/AS01 phase III trial and bed net prevalence data were used to determine the effect of vaccination in the urban/periurban and rural areas of Lilongwe, Malawi. Cost data were used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of various interventions over three years. FINDINGS: Since bed nets reduce malaria incidence and homogeneous vaccine efficacy was assumed, participants without bed nets received greater relative benefit from vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 than participants with bed nets. Similarly, since malaria incidence in rural Lilongwe is higher than in urban Lilongwe, the impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccine interventions is increased in rural areas. In rural Lilongwe, we estimated that vaccinating one child without a bed net would prevent 2_59 (1_62 to 3_38) cases of malaria over three years, corresponding to a cost of $10_08 (7_71 to 16_13) per case averted. Alternatively, vaccinating one child with a bed net would prevent 1_59 (0_87 to 2_57) cases, corresponding to $16_43 (10_16 to 30_06) per case averted. Providing RTS,S/AS01 to 30,000 children in rural Lilongwe was estimated to cost $782,400 and to prevent 58,611 (35,778 to 82,932) cases of malaria over a three-year period. Joint interventions providing both vaccination and bed nets (to those without them) were estimated to prevent additional cases of malaria and to be similarly cost-effective, compared to vaccine-only interventions. INTERPRETATION: To maximize malaria prevention, vaccination and bed net distribution programs could be integrated.

1558,"Sedentary behavior and prevalent diabetes in 6,166 older women: the objective physical activity and cardiovascular health study BACKGROUND: We examined associations of sedentary time and sedentary accumulation patterns (ie, how sedentary time is accumulated) with prevalent diabetes in an ethnically diverse cohort of older women. METHODS: Community-dwelling women aged 63-99 (n = 6,116; median age = 79) wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers 24 h/day for up to 7 days from which we derived average daily sedentary time and three measures of sedentary accumulation patterns: breaks in sedentary time, usual sedentary bout duration, and alpha. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalent diabetes were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent (n = 1,282) of participants had diabetes. Women in the highest quartile of sedentary time (_10.3 h/day) had higher odds of diabetes (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.77-2.70) than women in the lowest quartile (_8.3 h/day). Prolonged accumulation patterns (ie, accumulating sedentary time in longer sedentary bouts) was associated with higher odds of diabetes than regularly interrupted patterns (comparing quartiles with the most vs least prolonged patterns: usual bout duration OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.28-1.92; alpha OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.32-1.97); however, there was no significant association for breaks in sedentary time (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.82-1.20). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of sedentary time and accumulating it in prolonged patterns were associated with increased odds of diabetes among older women. _ The Author(s) 2018.

1559,"Sedentary behavior and cardiovascular disease in older women: The Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) Study Background: Evidence that higher sedentary time is associated with higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is based mainly on self-reported measures. Few studies have examined whether patterns of sedentary time are associated with higher risk for CVD. Methods: Women from the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) Study (n=5638, aged 63-97, mean age=79_7) with no history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke wore accelerometers for 4-to-7 days and were followed for up to 4.9 years for CVD events. Average daily sedentary time and mean sedentary bout duration were the exposures of interest. Cox regression models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CVD using models adjusted for covariates and subsequently adjusted for potential mediators (body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, and CVD-risk biomarkers [fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure]). Restricted cubic spline regression characterized dose-response relationships. Results: There were 545 CVD events during 19,350 person-years. Adjusting for covariates, women in the highest (_ ~11 hr/day) vs. the lowest (_ ~9 hr/day) quartile of sedentary time had higher risk for CVD (HR=1.62; CI=1.21-2.17; p-trend < 0.001). Further adjustment for potential mediators attenuated but did not eliminate significance of these associations (p-trend< .05, each). Longer vs. shorter mean bout duration was associated with higher risks for CVD (HR=1.54; CI=1.27-2.02; p-trend=0.003) after adjustment for covariates. Additional adjustment for CVD-risk biomarkers attenuated associations resulting in a quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 HR=1.36; CI=1.01-1.83; p-trend=0.10). Dose-response associations of sedentary time and bout duration with CVD were linear (P-nonlinear >0.05, each). Women jointly classified as having high sedentary time and long bout durations had significantly higher risk for CVD (HR=1.34; CI=1.08-1.65) than women with both low sedentary time and short bout duration. All analyses were repeated for incident coronary heart disease (MI or CVD death) and associations were similar with notably stronger hazard ratios. Conclusions: Both high sedentary time and long mean bout durations were associated in a dose-response manner with increased CVD risk in older women, suggesting that efforts to reduce CVD burden may benefit from addressing either or both component(s) of sedentary behavior.",,,9,,,
1560,"Past, present, and future of healthy life expectancy The success of the current biomedical paradigm based on a ""disease model"" may be limited in the future because of large number of comorbidities inflicting older people. In recent years, there has been growing empirical evidence, based on animal models, suggesting that the aging process could be delayed and that this process may lead to increases in life expectancy accompanied by improvements in health at older ages. In this review, we explore past, present, and future prospects of healthy life expectancy and examine whether increases in average length of life associated with delayed aging link with additional years lived disability-free at older ages. Trends in healthy life expectancy suggest improvements among older people in the United States, although younger cohorts appear to be reaching old age with increasing levels of frailty and disability. Trends in health risk factors, such as obesity and smoking, show worrisome signs of negative impacts on adult health and mortality in the near future. However, results based on a simulation model of delayed aging in humans indicate that it has the potential to increase not only the length of life but also the fraction and number of years spent disability-free at older ages. Delayed aging would likely come with additional aggregate costs. These costs could be offset if delayed aging is widely applied and people are willing to convert their greater healthiness into more years of work.

1561,"Risk factors associated with the presence and severity of food insecurity in rural Honduras OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with the presence and severity of food insecurity among a sample of Honduran caregivers of young children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study in which the dependent variable, household food insecurity, was measured using a fourteen-item questionnaire developed and validated in a population of similar cultural context. A predictive modelling strategy used backwards elimination in logistic regression and multinomial logit regression models to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for food insecurity. SETTING: Rural Honduras in the department of Intibuc_, between March and April 2009. SUBJECTS: Two-hundred and ninety-eight Honduran caregivers of children aged 6-18 months. RESULTS: Ninety-three per cent of households were classified as having some degree of food insecurity (mild, moderate or severe). After controlling for caregiver age and marital status, compared with caregivers with more than primary-school education, those with less than primary-school education had 3_47 (95% CI 1_34, 8_99) times the odds of severe food insecurity and 2_29 (95% CI 1_00, 5_25) times the odds of moderate food insecurity. Our results also found that child anthropometric status was not associated with the presence or severity of food insecurity. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that among the sociodemographic factors assessed, food insecurity in rural Honduras is associated with maternal education. Understanding key factors associated with food insecurity that are unique to Honduras can inform the design of interventions to effectively mitigate the negative impact of food insecurity on children.",,,1,,,
1562,"Evidence for etiologic subtypes of breast cancer in the carolina breast cancer study BACKGROUND: Distinctions in the etiology of triple-negative versus luminal breast cancer have become well established using immunohistochemical surrogates [notably estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)]. However, it is unclear whether established immunohistochemical subtypes are the sole or definitive means of etiologically subdividing breast cancers. METHODS: We evaluated clinical biomarkers and tumor suppressor p53 with risk factor data from cases and controls in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a population-based study of incident breast cancers. For each individual marker and combinations of markers, we calculated an aggregate measure to distinguish the etiologic heterogeneity of different classification schema. To compare schema, we estimated subtype-specific case-control odds ratios for individual risk factors and fit age-at-incidence curves with two-component mixture models. We also evaluated subtype concordance of metachronous contralateral breast tumors in the California Cancer Registry. RESULTS: ER was the biomarker that individually explained the greatest variability in risk factor profiles. However, further subdivision by p53 significantly increased the degree of etiologic heterogeneity. Age at diagnosis, nulliparity, and race were heterogeneously associated with ER/p53 subtypes. The ER-/p53+ subtype exhibited a similar risk factor profile and age-at-incidence distribution to the triple-negative subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical marker-based intrinsic subtypes have established value, yet other schema may also yield important etiologic insights. IMPACT: Novel environmental or genetic risk factors may be identifiable by considering different etiologic schema, including cross-classification based on ER/p53. _2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",,,3,,,
1563,"A risk score to identify HIV-infected women most likely to become lost to follow-up in the postpartum period Access to lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is expanding among HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). For this strategy to meaningfully improve maternal HIV outcomes, retention in HIV care is essential. We developed a risk score to identify women with high likelihood of loss to follow-up (LTFU) at 6 months postpartum from HIV care, using data from public health facilities in Lusaka, Zambia. LTFU was defined as not presenting for HIV care within 60 days of the last scheduled appointment. We used logistic regression to assess demographic, obstetric and HIV predictors of LTFU and to develop a simple risk score. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed at each risk score cut-point. Among 2029 pregnant women initiating cART between 2009 and 2011, 507 (25%) were LTFU by 6 months postpartum. Parity, education, employment status, WHO clinical stage, duration of cART during pregnancy and number of antenatal care visits were associated with LTFU (p-value_< _.10). A risk score cut-point of 11 (42nd percentile) had 85% sensitivity (95% CI 82%, 88%) and 22% specificity (95% CI 20%, 24%) to detect women LTFU and would exclude 20% of women from a retention intervention. A risk score cut-point of 18 (69th percentile) identified the 23% of women with the highest probability of LTFU and had sensitivity 32% (95% CI 28%, 36%) and specificity 80% (95% CI 78%, 82%). A risk score approach may be useful to triage a subset of women most likely to be LTFU for targeted retention interventions.",,,6,,,
1564,"Disparities in Depressive Symptoms and Antidepressant Treatment by Gender and Race/Ethnicity among People Living with HIV in the United States OBJECTIVE: To describe disparities along the depression treatment cascade, from indication for antidepressant treatment to effective treatment, in HIV-infected individuals by gender and race/ethnicity. METHODS: The Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort includes 31,000 HIV-infected adults in routine clinical care at 8 sites. Individuals were included in the analysis if they had a depressive symptoms measure within one month of establishing HIV care at a CNICS site. Depressive symptoms were measured using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Indication for antidepressant treatment was defined as PHQ-9 _ 10 or a current antidepressant prescription. Antidepressant treatment was defined as a current antidepressant prescription. Evidence-based antidepressant treatment was considered treatment changes based on a person's most recent PHQ-9, in accordance with clinical guidelines. We calculated the cumulative probability of moving through the depression treatment cascade within 24 months of entering CNICS HIV care. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between gender, race/ethnicity, and a range of depression outcomes. RESULTS: In our cohort of HIV-infected adults in routine care, 47% had an indication for antidepressant treatment. Significant drop-offs along the depression treatment cascade were seen for the entire study sample. However, important disparities existed. Women were more likely to have an indication for antidepressant treatment (HR 1.54; 95% CI 1.34, 1.78), receive antidepressant treatment (HR 2.03; 95% CI 1.53, 2.69) and receive evidence-based antidepressant treatment (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.03, 2.74), even after accounting for race/ethnicity. Black non-Hispanics (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35, 0.65), Hispanics (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44, 0.89) and other race/ethnicities (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17, 0.73) were less likely to initiate antidepressant treatment, compared to white non-Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of HIV-infected adults depressive symptoms were common. Important disparities in the prevalence of depressive symptoms and receipt of antidepressant treatment existed by gender and race/ethnicity.",,,5,,,
1565,"Patterns of efavirenz use as first-line antiretroviral therapy in the United States: 1999-2015 BACKGROUND: Efavirenz has been a mainstay of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for over 15 years in the US. Its association with neuropsychiatric side effects may influence clinical prescribing and management. METHODS: We included HIV-infected adults enrolled in care at seven sites across the US, who initiated combination ART between 1999 and 2015. We examined the proportion initiating and continuing on efavirenz, overall and by mental health status. Log binomial and Cox models were used to estimate associations between mental health, clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and initiating or switching from efavirenz as first-line ART. RESULTS: Of the 8,230 participants included, 3,710 (45%) initiated efavirenz. In multivariable analyses, prior mono- or dual-ART, ART initiation after 2006, being female, intravenous drug use, antidepressant prescription, previous mental health diagnosis and baseline CD4+ T-cell count >350 cells/mm3 were inversely associated with initiating efavirenz. Participants initiating efavirenz had a faster time to a regimen switch, compared with those initiating an efavirenz-free regimen (P-value < 0.01). Among efavirenz initiators, starting efavirenz in more recent time periods and a previous mental health diagnosis were associated with faster time to switching from efavirenz. Despite this, 40-50% of participants with a previous mental health diagnosis initiated and continued on efavirenz for much of the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple clinical factors, including mental health diagnoses, appeared to influence efavirenz use. While mental health diagnosis status and more recent treatment starts were associated with shorter duration of efavirenz therapy, a previous mental health diagnosis did not preclude efavirenz initiation or continuation in many participants.",,,5,,,
1566,"Improving Depression Among HIV-Infected Adults: Transporting the Effect of a Depression Treatment Intervention to Routine Care BACKGROUND: Depression affects 20%-30% of people with HIV. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions to improve depression among HIV-infected adults, but typically have highly selected populations which may limit generalizability. Inverse probability of sampling weights (IPSW) is a recently proposed method to transport (or standardize) findings from RCTs to a specific external target population. METHODS: We used IPSW to transport the 6-month effect of the Measurement-Based Care (MBC) intervention on depression from the SLAM DUNC trial to a population of HIV-infected, depressed adults in routine care in the United States between 2010 and 2014. RESULTS: In the RCT, MBC was associated with an improvement in depression at 6 months of 3.6 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale [95% confidence interval (CI): -5.9 to -1.3]. When IPSW were used to standardize results from the trial to the target population, the intervention effect was attenuated by 1.2 points (mean improvement 2.4 points; 95% CI: -6.1 to 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: If implemented among HIV-infected, depressed adults in routine care, MBC may be less effective than in the RCT but can still be expected to reduce depression. Attenuation of the intervention effect among adults in routine care reflects the fact that the trial enrolled a larger proportion of individuals for whom the intervention was more effective. Given the burden of depression among HIV-infected adults, more effective interventions to improve depression are urgently needed. However, examining the transportability of trial findings is essential to understand whether similar effects can be expected if interventions are scaled-up.",,,6,,,
1567,"Relationship between ever reporting depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality in a cohort of HIV-infected adults in routine care OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether ever reporting depressive symptoms affects mortality in the modern HIV treatment era. DESIGN: A cohort study of HIV-infected adults in routine clinical care at seven sites in the USA. METHODS: We examined the effect of ever reporting depressive symptoms on all-cause mortality using data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems cohort. We included individuals with at least one depression measure between 2005 and 2014. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9. We used weighted Kaplan-Meier curves and marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability weights to estimate the effect of ever reporting depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 _10) on all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 10_895 individuals were included. Participants were followed for a median of 3.1 years (35_621 total person-years). There were 491 (4.5%) deaths during the follow-up period (crude incidence rate 13.8/1000 person-years). At baseline, 28% of the population reported depressive symptoms. In the weighted analysis, there was no evidence that ever reporting depressive symptoms increased the hazard of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.55-1.24). CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of HIV-infected adults in care in the modern treatment era, we observed no evidence that ever reporting depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of all-cause mortality, controlling for a range of time-varying factors. Antiretroviral therapy that is increasingly robust to moderate adherence and improved access to depression treatment may help to explain changes in the relationship between depressive symptoms and mortality in the modern treatment era.",,,5,,,
1568,"Temporal trends in the occurrence and outcomes of atrial fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction (from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Surveillance Study) Atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently coexists in the setting of myocardial infarction (MI), being associated with increased mortality. Nonetheless, temporal trends in the occurrence of AF complicating MI and in the prognosis of these patients are not well described. We examined temporal trends in prevalence of AF in the setting of MI and the effect of AF on prognosis in the community. We studied a population-based sample of 20,049 validated first-incident nonfatal hospitalized MIs among 35- to 74-year old residents of 4 communities in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study from 1987 through 2009. Prevalence of AF in the setting of MI increased from 11% to 15% during the 23-year study period. The multivariable adjusted odds ratio for prevalent AF, per 5-year increment, was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.19). Overall, in patients with MI, AF was associated with increased 1-year case fatality (odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.01) compared with those without AF. However, there was no evidence that the impact of AF on MI survival changed over time or differed over time by sex, race, or MI classification (all p values >0.10). In conclusion, co-occurrence of AF in MI slightly increased between 1987 and 2009. The adverse impact of AF on survival in the setting of MI was consistent throughout. In the setting of MI, co-occurrence of AF should be viewed as a critical clinical event, and treatment needs unique to this population should be explored further. Copyright _ 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1569,"Comparable ascertainment of newly-diagnosed atrial fibrillation using active cohort follow-up versus surveillance of centers for medicare and medicaid services in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study OBJECTIVE: Increasingly, epidemiologic studies use administrative data to identify atrial fibrillation (AF). Capture of incident AF is not well documented. We examined incidence rates and concordance of AF diagnosis based on active cohort follow-up versus surveillance of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. METHODS: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort participants without prevalent AF enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, with inpatient and outpatient coverage, for at least 12 continuous months between 1991 and 2009 were included. In active Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study follow-up, annual telephone calls captured hospitalizations and deaths with incident AF diagnosis codes. For Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data, incident AF was defined by billed inpatient and outpatient diagnoses. RESULTS: Of 10,134 eligible cohort participants, 738 developed AF according to both Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data; an additional 93 and 288 incident cases were identified using only Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data, respectively. Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years were 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 10.1-11.6) and 13.6 (95% confidence interval: 12.8-14.4) in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, respectively; agreement was 96%; kappa was 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.80). Earlier AF ascertainment by one system versus the other was not associated with any cardiovascular disease risk factors, after accounting for sociodemographic factors. Additional Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services events did not alter observed associations between risk factors and AF. CONCLUSION: Among fee-for-service enrollees, AF incidence rates were slightly lower for active cohort follow-up than for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services surveillance, because the latter included outpatient atrial fibrillation. Concordance was high and combining the two approaches could provide a more complete picture of newly-diagnosed AF.",,,5,,,
1570,"Impact of atrial fibrillation on healthcare utilization in the community: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risk of hospitalization. Little is known about the impact of AF on utilization of noninpatient health care or about sex or race differences in AF-related utilization. We examined rates of inpatient and outpatient utilization by AF status in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants with incident AF enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare for at least 12 continuous months between 1991 and 2009 (n=932) were matched on age, sex, race and field center with up to 3 participants without AF (n=2729). Healthcare utilization was ascertained from Medicare claims and classified by primary International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision code. The average annual numbers of days hospitalized were 13.2 (95% CI 11.6 to 15.0) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.1) for those with and without AF, respectively. The corresponding numbers of annual outpatient claims were 53.3 (95% CI 50.5 to 56.3) and 22.9 (95% CI 22.1 to 23.8) for those with and without AF, respectively. Most utilization among AF patients was attributable to non-AF conditions. The adjusted rate ratio for annual days hospitalized for other cardiovascular disease-related reasons was 4.58 (95% CI: 3.41 to 6.16) for those with AF versus those without AF. The association between AF and healthcare utilization was similar among men and women and among white and black participants. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with AF had considerably greater healthcare utilization, and the difference in utilization for other cardiovascular disease-related reasons was substantial. In addition to rate or rhythm treatment, AF management should focus on the accompanying cardiovascular comorbidities. _ 2014 The Authors.

1573,"Comparison of menus to actual foods and beverages served in North Carolina child-care centers Menus from child-care centers are an important source of information for parents, researchers, and child-care regulators, but previous research suggests that menus do not accurately represent foods served. The purpose of this study was to compare menus with actual foods and beverages served to children in child-care centers. Menus were collected and a dietary observation was conducted to document all foods and beverages served to children during the course of 1 day in 84 child-care centers in North Carolina in the fall of 2005. Frequencies of foods and beverages on the menus vs those served were computed by eating occasion, food category, and individual foods and beverages. Of the 254 meals and snacks served, 131 (52%) meals and snacks matched entirely what was stated on the menu. Of the 820 individual foods and beverages served, 710 (86.6%) matched those listed on the menus. An additional 110 foods and beverages were served but not listed on the menus. Grains, juice, and vegetables were served less often than indicated on the menus, and milk, protein-rich foods, fruits, mixed dishes, and foods of low nutritional value were served more often than listed on the menus. Overall, just over half of all meals and snacks matched menus, and nearly 90% of individual foods and beverages served matched those stated on menus. Parents of children in child care and dietetics practitioners providing consultation to child-care centers can encourage not only provision of healthy foods and beverages, but also accurate menus in child care.

1574,"A community-based intervention increases physical activity and reduces obesity in school-age children in North Carolina BACKGROUND: Community-based interventions are promising approaches to obesity prevention, but few studies have prospectively evaluated them. The aim of this study was to evaluate a natural experiment__ community intervention designed to promote active living and decrease obesity within a small southern town. METHODS: In 2011, community leaders implemented the Mebane on the Move intervention__ community-wide effort to promote physical activity (PA) and decrease obesity among residents of Mebane, North Carolina. We measured child PA and BMI before and after the intervention, using a nearby town not implementing an intervention as the comparison. In total, we assessed 64 children from Mebane and 40 from the comparison community 6 months before, as well as 34 and 18 children 6 months after the intervention. We assessed PA with accelerometers worn for 7 days and calculated BMI z-scores using children's height and weight. We conducted multivariable linear regressions examining pre- to postintervention change in minutes of PA and BMI z-score, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: At follow-up, children in Mebane modestly increased their moderate-to-vigorous PA (1.3 minutes per hour; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2, 2.3; p=0.03) and vigorous activity (0.8 minutes per hour; 95% CI: 0.1, 1.5; p=0.04) more than comparison children. In intervention children, BMI z-scores decreased 0.5 units (kg/m(2); 95% CI: -0.9, -0.02; p=0.045), compared to children in the comparison community. CONCLUSIONS: We observed positive effects on PA level and weight status of children in Mebane, despite high rates of attrition, suggesting that the community-based intervention may have been successful.",,,9,,,
1575,"Preventing childhood obesity in early care and education settings: lessons from two intervention studies BACKGROUND: Obesity prevention in young children is a public health priority. In the USA, nearly 10% of children less than 5__ears of age are obese, and most attend some form of out-of-home child care. While a number of interventions have been conducted in early care and education settings, few have targeted the youngest children in care or the less formal types of child care like family child care homes. Additionally, only two previous studies provided recommendations to help inform future interventions. METHODS: This paper presents lessons learned from two distinct intervention studies in early care and education settings to help guide researchers and public health professionals interested in implementing and evaluating similar interventions. We highlight two studies: one targeting children ages 4 to 24__onths in child care centres and the other intervening in children 18__onths to 4__ears in family child care homes. We include lessons from our pilot studies and the ongoing larger trials. RESULTS: To date, our experiences suggest that an intervention should have a firm basis in behaviour change theory; an advisory group should help evaluate intervention materials and plan for delivery; and realistic recruitment goals should recognize economic challenges of the business of child care. A flexible data collection approach and realistic sample size calculations are needed because of high rates of child (and sometimes facility) turnover. An intervention that is relatively easy to implement is more likely to appeal to a wide variety of early care and education providers. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to prevent obesity in early care and education have the potential to reach large numbers of children. It is important to consider the unique features and similarities of centres and family child care homes and take advantage of lessons learned from current studies in order to develop effective, evidence-based interventions. _ 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,2,,,
1576,"Correlation between maternal and infant cortisol varies by breastfeeding status OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine associations of mother and infant salivary cortisol, measured three times over the course of a day, and assess whether these varied by breastfeeding status. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 54 mothers and their infants aged 4-11 months. Mothers collected their own saliva and that of their infants upon awakening, 30min after waking and at bedtime. Breastfeeding status was reported by mothers and cortisol level was measured in saliva in _g/dl using standard techniques. We used generalized linear models to evaluate relationships between maternal and infant cortisol levels, and assessed whether the relationship differed by breastfeeding status: formula only compared to partial and full breastfeeding, adjusting for infant sex, race, age, maternal education, and family income. RESULTS: Thirty-four infants received formula only and 20 were either partially or fully breastfed. Breastfeeding was associated with higher household income, higher maternal education, and white race. Cortisol levels were higher among breastfed infants at all three time points. After adjustment, maternal cortisol levels were related with infant cortisol at bedtime only (regression estimate 0.06; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.1; p=0.02). The adjusted association between bedtime maternal and infant cortisol was stronger among breastfeeding dyads than among formula-feeding dyads (regression estimate 1.0; 95% CI: 0.1, 2.0; p=0.04 vs. 0.6; CI: -0.1, 1.3; p=0.10). In addition, we assessed the influence of maternal education and household income in our adjusted model; income strengthened the observed association, whereas maternal education did not change the estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding mothers and infants had significant correlations for cortisol at bedtime, while formula-feeding dyads did not. These data suggest that several factors may contribute to cortisol synchrony observed in mother/infant dyads, including the transfer of cortisol in human milk, physical interaction such as skin-to-skin contact, and shared environment. In addition, our findings support household income as a possible contributor. Copyright _ 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,2,,,
1577,"Nutrition practices and mealtime environments of North Carolina child care centers BACKGROUND: The majority of children in the United States attend out-of-home child care. However, little is known about the nutritional quality of foods served and the mealtime environments. METHODS: We assessed 96 child care centers over one full day using a researcher-administered structured observation and document review. We focused on eight nutrition domains: (1) fruits and vegetables, (2) whole grains, (3) high-sugar, high-salt, and high-fat foods, (4) beverages, (5) food availability and service, (6) staff behaviors, (7) training and education, and (8) policies. We computed daily means and frequencies for each domain. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of centers participated in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, indicating they served low-income children. Centers enrolled 66 children on average; 60% were white, 28% were black, 4% were Native American, and 8% identified as mixed race. On the day of observation, seven centers did not serve a fruit and 15 did not serve a vegetable. Eighty centers served a high-sugar or high-salt food and 84 did not serve any whole grains. Five centers did not provide water indoors to children, 22 served juice twice, and 50 served whole milk. Seventeen centers had a vending machine on site visible to parents and children. Overall, children were served excessive juice, high-sugar and high-salt snack foods, and too much whole milk. CONCLUSIONS: Centers had room for improvement and could strive to serve more nutritious foods and create healthier mealtime environments for children.",,,5,,,
1578,"The family child care home environment and children's diet quality BACKGROUND: Developing healthy eating behaviors and food preferences in early childhood may help establish future healthy diets. Large numbers of children spend time in child care, but little research has assessed the nutritional quality of meals and snacks in family child care homes. Therefore, it is important to assess foods and beverages provided, policies related to nutrition and feeding children, and interactions between providers and children during mealtimes. We examined associations between the nutrition environments of family child care homes and children's diet quality. METHODS: We assessed the nutrition environments of 166 family child care homes using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) (scores range: 0-21). We also recorded foods and beverages consumed by 496 children in care and calculated healthy eating index (HEI) (scores range: 0-100). We used a mixed effects linear regression model to examine the association between the EPAO nutrition environment (and EPAO sub-scales) and child HEI, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Family child care homes had a mean (standard deviation, SD) of 7.2 (3.6) children in care, 74.1% of providers were black or African American, and children had a mean (SD) age of 35.7 (11.4) months. In adjusted multivariable models, higher EPAO nutrition score was associated with increased child HEI score (1.16; 95% CI: 0.34, 1.98; p_=_0.006). Higher scores on EPAO sub-scales for foods provided (8.98; 95% CI: 3.94, 14.01; p_=_0.0006), nutrition education (5.37; 95% CI: 0.80, 9.94; p_=_0.02), and nutrition policy (2.36; 95% CI: 0.23, 4.49; p_=_0.03) were all associated with greater child HEI score. CONCLUSIONS: Foods and beverages served, in addition to nutrition education and nutrition policies in family child care homes, may be promising intervention targets for improving child diet quality.

1580,"Comparison of 7-day recall and daily diary reports of COPD symptoms and impacts OBJECTIVE: Patient reporting of symptoms in a questionnaire with a 7-day recall period was expected to differ from symptom reporting in a 7-day symptom diary on the basis of cognitive theory of memory processes and several studies of symptoms and health behaviors. METHODS: A total of 101 adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) completed a daily diary of items measuring symptoms and impacts of COPD for 7 days, and on the seventh day they completed a questionnaire of the same items with a 7-day recall period. The analysis examined concordance of 7-day recall with summary descriptors of the daily responses, examined the magnitude and covariates (patient characteristics and response patterns) of the difference between 7-day recall and mean of daily responses, and compared the discriminant ability and ability to detect change of 7-day recall and mean of daily responses. RESULTS: A 7-day recall was moderately concordant with the mean and maximum of daily responses and was 0.34 to 0.50 SDs higher than the mean of daily responses. Only the weekly report itself was a covariate of the difference. The discriminant ability and ability to detect change were equivalent. CONCLUSIONS: In measuring the weeklong experience of COPD symptoms and impacts on groups of patients, the 7-day recall scores were higher than the daily diary scores, but equivalent in detecting change over time.

1581,"Mode equivalence and acceptability of tablet computer-, interactive voice response system-, and paper-based administration of the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) BACKGROUND: PRO-CTCAE is a library of items that measure cancer treatment-related symptomatic adverse events (NCI Contracts: HHSN261201000043C and HHSN 261201000063C). The objective of this study is to examine the equivalence and acceptability of the three data collection modes (Web-enabled touchscreen tablet computer, Interactive voice response system [IVRS], and paper) available within the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) measurement system. METHODS: Participants (n = 112; median age 56.5; 24 % high school or less) receiving treatment for cancer at seven US sites completed 28 PRO-CTCAE items (scoring range 0-4) by three modes (order randomized) at a single study visit. Subjects completed one page (approx. 15 items) of the EORTC QLQ-C30 between each mode as a distractor. Item scores by mode were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC); differences in scores within the 3-mode crossover design were evaluated with mixed-effects models. Difficulties with each mode experienced by participants were also assessed. RESULTS: 103 (92 %) completed questionnaires by all three modes. The median ICC comparing tablet vs IVRS was 0.78 (range 0.55-0.90); tablet vs paper: 0.81 (0.62-0.96); IVRS vs paper: 0.78 (0.60-0.91); 89 % of ICCs were _0.70. Item-level mean differences by mode were small (medians [ranges] for tablet vs. IVRS_=_-0.04 [-0.16-0.22]; tablet vs paper = -0.02 [-0.11-0.14]; IVRS vs paper = 0.02 [-0.07-0.19]), and 57/81 (70 %) items had bootstrapped 95 % CI around the effect sizes within +/-0.20. The median time to complete the questionnaire by tablet was 3.4 min; IVRS: 5.8; paper: 4.0. The proportion of participants by mode who reported ""no problems"" responding to the questionnaire was 86 % tablet, 72 % IVRS, and 98 % paper. CONCLUSIONS: Mode equivalence of items was moderate to high, and comparable to test-retest reliability (median ICC = 0.80). Each mode was acceptable to a majority of respondents. Although the study was powered to detect moderate or larger discrepancies between modes, the observed ICCs and very small mean differences between modes provide evidence to support study designs that are responsive to patient or investigator preference for mode of administration, and justify comparison of results and pooled analyses across studies that employ different PRO-CTCAE modes of administration.

This study compared these two types of recall in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: One hundred and forty adults with T2D completed a daily diary for 7_days containing 9 T2D-related symptom and impact items. On day 7, patients completed the same items with a 7-day recall period. We examined the concordance of 7-day recall with summary descriptors of the daily reports and compared the scores and the discriminant ability of 7-day recall and mean of daily reports. RESULTS: Seven-day recall was most concordant with the mean of daily reports. The average difference in scores was small (range 0.22-0.77 on 11-point scale) and less than 0.5 standard deviations. For some items, the difference was positively associated with the variation in daily reports. The discriminant ability was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, a questionnaire with 7-day recall provided information consistent with a daily diary measure of the average week-long experience of T2D symptoms and impacts.",,,4,,,

METHODS: Adult patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) wore pedometers and completed PRO assessments during transplant hospitalization (4 weeks) and 4 weeks post-discharge. Patient reports of symptomatic treatment toxicities (single items from PRO-CTCAE, http://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae ) and symptoms, physical health, mental health, and quality of life (PROMIS(_) Global-10, http://nih.promis.org ), assessed weekly with 7-day recall on Likert scales, were compared individually with pedometry data, summarized as average daily steps per week, using linear mixed models.

Federal, state, and local agencies and data resources use different definitions, which may lead to confusion and inequity in the distribution of resources depending on the definition used. This article highlights how inconsistent definitions of rural may lead to measurement bias in research, the interpretation of research outcomes, and differential eligibility for rural-focused grants and other funding. We conclude by making specific recommendations on how policy makers and researchers could use these definitions more appropriately, along with definitions we propose, to better serve rural residents.

1588,"Phenotype harmonization and cross-study collaboration in GWAS consortia: the GENEVA experience Genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia and collaborations formed to detect genetic loci for common phenotypes or investigate gene-environment (G*E) interactions are increasingly common. While these consortia effectively increase sample size, phenotype heterogeneity across studies represents a major obstacle that limits successful identification of these associations. Investigators are faced with the challenge of how to harmonize previously collected phenotype data obtained using different data collection instruments which cover topics in varying degrees of detail and over diverse time frames. This process has not been described in detail. We describe here some of the strategies and pitfalls associated with combining phenotype data from varying studies. Using the Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA) multi-site GWAS consortium as an example, this paper provides an illustration to guide GWAS consortia through the process of phenotype harmonization and describes key issues that arise when sharing data across disparate studies. GENEVA is unusual in the diversity of disease endpoints and so the issues it faces as its participating studies share data will be informative for many collaborations. Phenotype harmonization requires identifying common phenotypes, determining the feasibility of cross-study analysis for each, preparing common definitions, and applying appropriate algorithms. Other issues to be considered include genotyping timeframes, coordination of parallel efforts by other collaborative groups, analytic approaches, and imputation of genotype data. GENEVA's harmonization efforts and policy of promoting data sharing and collaboration, not only within GENEVA but also with outside collaborations, can provide important guidance to ongoing and new consortia. _ 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,,8,,,
1589,"A survey of microRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms identifies novel breast cancer susceptibility loci in a case-control, population-based study of African-American women BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and influence cancer. Primary transcripts of miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are poorly annotated and little is known about the role of germline variation in miRNA genes and breast cancer (BC). We sought to identify germline miRNA variants associated with BC risk and tumor subtype among African-American (AA) women. METHODS: Under the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) Consortium, genotyping and imputed data from four studies on BC in AA women were combined into a final dataset containing 224,188 miRNA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 8350 women: 3663 cases and 4687 controls. The primary miRNA sequence was identified for 566 miRNA genes expressed in Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Tier 1 cell types and human pancreatic islets. Association analysis was conducted using logistic regression for BC status overall and by tumor subtype. RESULTS: A novel BC signal was localized to an 8.6-kb region of 17q25.3 by four SNPs (rs9913477, rs1428882938, rs28585511, and rs7502931) and remained statistically significant after multiple test correction (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-1.65; p =_3.15___10-7; false discovery rate (FDR)_=_0.03). These SNPs reside in a genomic location that includes both the predicted primary transcript of the noncoding miRNA gene MIR3065 and the first intron of the gene for brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 (BAIAP2). Furthermore, miRNA-associated SNPs on chromosomes 1p32.3, 5q32, and 3p25.1 were the strongest signals for hormone receptor, luminal versus basal-like, and HER2 enrichment status, respectively. A second phase of genotyping (1397_BC cases, 2418 controls) that included two SNPs in the 8.6-kb region was used for validation and meta-analysis. While neither rs4969239 nor rs9913477 was validated, when meta-analyzed with the original dataset their association with BC remained directionally consistent (OR =_1.29, 95% CI = 1.16-1.44 (p_=_4.18___10-6) and OR_=_1.33, 95% CI = 1.17-1.51 (p_=_1.6___10-5), respectively). CONCLUSION: Germline genetic variation indicates that MIR3065 may play an important role in BC development and heterogeneity among AA women. Further investigation to determine the potential functional effects of these SNPs is warranted. This study contributes to our understanding of BC risk in AA women and highlights the complexity in evaluating variation in gene-dense regions of the human genome.",,,3,,,

In a race-stratified analysis using unconditional logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate SNP association with breast cancer risk. Additionally, hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer-specific mortality were estimated.RESULTS: Two miR-185 SNPs provided suggestive evidence of an inverse association with breast cancer risk (rs2008591, OR = 0.72 (95 % CI = 0.53-0.98, p value = 0.04) and rs887205, OR = 0.71 (95 % CI = 0.52-0.96, p value = 0.03), respectively) among African Americans. Two SNPs, miR-34b/34c (rs4938723, HR = 0.57 (95 % CI = 0.37-0.89, p value = 0.01)) and miR-206 (rs6920648, HR = 0.77 (95 % CI = 0.61-0.97, p value = 0.02)), provided evidence of association with breast cancer survival. Further adjustment for stage resulted in more modest associations with survival (HR = 0.65 [95 % CI = 0.42-1.02, p value = 0.06] and HR = 0.79 [95 % CI = 0.62-1.00, p value = 0.05, respectively]).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that germline variation in the 5' region proximal to pre-miRNA gene sequences may be associated with breast cancer risk among African Americans and breast cancer-specific survival generally; however, further validation is needed to confirm these findings.",,,3,,,
1591,"Admixture mapping of prostate cancer in African Americans participating in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) BACKGROUND: Few genetic risk factors have been uncovered that contribute specifically to the racial disparity in prostate cancer (CaP) observed in African Americans (AA). With the advent of ancestry informative marker (AIM) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels and powerful genetic strategies such as mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium (MALD) it is possible to discover genes that underlie ethnic variation in disease risk. METHODS: One thousand one hundred thirty AA CaP cases enrolled in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) were genotyped using a 1,509 AIM SNP panel. MALD was performed using ADMIXMAP to test for linkage between CaP risk and ancestry estimates at each AIM SNP. RESULTS: The largest increase of African ancestry was observed at marker rs12543473 (P_=_0.0011), located on chromosome 8q24.21, and the greatest excess of European ancestry was observed at marker rs10768140 (P_=_0.0004) at chromosome 11p13. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the 8q24 risk loci and identified a novel genomic region on 11p13 that is associated with CaP risk. These findings should be replicated in larger AA populations and combined with fine mapping data to further refine the novel 11p13 CaP risk loci. _ 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,
1592,"Genetic polymorphism and prostate cancer aggressiveness: a case-only study of 1,536 GWAS and candidate SNPs in African-Americans and European-Americans BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have established a number of replicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for susceptibility to prostate cancer (CaP), but it is unclear whether these susceptibility SNPs are also associated with disease aggressiveness. This study evaluates whether such replication SNPs or other candidate SNPs are associated with CaP aggressiveness in African-American (AA) and European-American (EA) men. METHODS: A 1,536 SNP panel which included 34 genome-wide association study (GWAS) replication SNPs, 38 flanking SNPs, a set of ancestry informative markers, and SNPs in candidate genes and other areas was genotyped in 1,060 AA and 1,087 EA men with incident CaP from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). Tests for association were conducted using ordinal logistic regression with a log-additive genotype model and a 3-category CaP aggressiveness variable. RESULTS: Four GWAS replication SNPs (rs2660753, rs13254738, rs10090154, rs2735839) and seven flanking SNPs were associated with CaP aggressiveness (P < 0.05) in three genomic regions: One at 3p12 (EA), seven at 8q24 (5 AA, 2 EA), and three at 19q13 at the kallilkrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) locus (two AA, one AA and EA). The KLK3 SNPs also were associated with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in AA (P < 0.001) but not in EA. A number of the other SNPs showed some evidence of association but none met study-wide significance levels after adjusting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Some replicated GWAS susceptibility SNPs may play a role in CaP aggressiveness. However, like susceptibility, these associations are not consistent between racial groups.

1593,"The Senegal urban reproductive health initiative: a longitudinal program impact evaluation OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the impact of key components of the Senegal Urban Reproductive Health Initiative, including radio, television, community-based activities, Muslim religious-leader engagement and service quality improvement on modern contraceptive use by all women and the sub-sample of poor women. STUDY DESIGN: This study uses baseline (2011) and endline (2015) longitudinal data from a representative sample of urban women first surveyed in 2011 to examine the impact of the Initiative's demand- and supply-side activities on modern contraceptive use. RESULTS: By endline, there was increased exposure to radio and television programming, religious leaders speaking favorably about contraception, and community-based initiatives. In the same period, modern contraceptive use increased from 16.9% to 22.1% with a slightly larger increase among the poor (16.6% to 24.1%). Multivariate analyses demonstrate that women exposed to community-based activities were more likely to use modern contraception by endline (marginal effect (ME): 5.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.50-7.74) than those not exposed. Further, women living within 1 km of a facility with family planning guidelines were more likely to use (ME: 3.54; 95% CI: 1.88-5.20) than women without a nearby facility with guidelines. Among poor women, community-based activities, radio exposure (ME: 4.21; 95% CI: 0.49-7.93), and living close to program facilities (ME: 4.32; 95% CI: 0.04-8.59) impacted use. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based activities are important for reaching urban women, including poor women, to achieve increased contraceptive use. Radio programming is also an important tool for increasing demand, particularly among poor women. Impacts of other program activities on contraceptive use were modest. IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that community-based activities led to increased modern contraceptive use among all women and poor women in urban Senegal. These findings can inform future programs in urban Senegal and elsewhere in francophone Africa. Copyright _ 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,3,,,
1594,"Longitudinal evaluation of the tupange urban family planning program in kenya CONTEXT: Levels of fertility and contraceptive use have long fluctuated in Kenya. The multicomponent Tupange program, part of the Urban Reproductive Health Initiative, was initiated in 2011 to increase use of modern family planning methods. METHODS: Women aged 15-49 in the five Kenyan cities where Tupange was implemented were interviewed in 2010 and reinterviewed in 2014 to obtain information on their contraceptive use and exposure to components of the Tupange program. Fixed-effects models were estimated to identify associations between program exposure and use of modern family planning methods. Analyses were performed to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of program components. RESULTS: During the four-year follow-up period, the proportion of women using modern contraceptives increased from 45% to 52%, and the proportion of users who were using long-acting or permanent methods rose from 6% to 19%. The fixed-effects model indicated that modern method use was associated with having heard Tupange-related local radio programming and marginally associated with having discussed family planning with a community health worker (CHW); among women who were unmarried or did not give birth during the study period, modern method use was associated with living near program facilities. Local radio programming was the most cost-effective program component, followed by proximity to Tupange facilities and discussions with CHWs. CONCLUSIONS: Urban reproductive health programs seeking to increase use of modern family planning methods in Kenya and other Sub-Saharan African settings should consider multicomponent approaches that include CHW activities, local radio programming and improvements to the supply environment.",,,3,,,

We conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study in 133,805 individuals with follow-up in an additional 253,467 individuals. Combined meta-analyses identified 13 new loci associated with lipids, some of which were detected only because association differed by smoking status. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of including diverse populations, particularly in studies of interactions with lifestyle factors, where genomic and lifestyle differences by ancestry may contribute to novel findings.",,,8,,,
1596,"Formative research methods for designing culturally appropriate, integrated child nutrition and development interventions: an overview Nutritional and developmental insults in the first few years of life have profound public health implications, including substantial contributions to neonatal, infant, and early childhood morbidity and mortality, as well as longer term effects on cognitive development, school achievement, and worker productivity. Optimal development that can lead to the attainment of an individual's fullest potential, therefore, requires a combination of genetic capacity, adequate nutrition, psychosocial stimulation, and safe, clean physical environments. Researchers and policymakers have called for integrated child nutrition and development interventions for more than 20 years, yet there are only a handful of efficacy trials and even fewer examples of integrated interventions that have been taken to scale. While a critical component in the design of such interventions is formative research, there is a dearth of information in both the literature and policy arenas to guide this phase of the process. To move the field forward, this paper first provides an overview of formative research methods with a focus on qualitative inquiry, a description of the critical domains to be assessed (infant and young child feeding, responsive feeding, and child development), and currently available resources. Application of these methods is provided through a real-world case study--the design of an integrated nutrition and child development efficacy trial in Andhra Pradesh, India. Recommendations for next steps are discussed, the most important of which is the need for a comprehensive set of formative guidelines for designing locally tailored, culturally appropriate, integrated interventions. _ 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.",,,5,,,

1599,"Responsive feeding and child undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries Growth faltering and nutritional deficiencies continue to be highly prevalent in infants and young children (IYC) living in low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries. There is increasing recognition that feeding behaviors and styles, particularly responsive feeding (RF), could influence acceptance of food and dietary intake and thus the growth of IYC. This paper presents the evolution of RF research and the strength of the evidence for RF on child undernutrition in LAMI countries. Multiple approaches were used to identify studies, including keyword searches in many databases, hand searches of retrieved articles, and consultation with experts in the field. Articles were included if they contained a RF exposure and child undernutrition outcome. In total, we identified 21 studies: 15 on child growth, 4 on dietary intake, 3 on disease, and 8 on eating behaviors. Most studies were conducted among children < 36 mo of age and were published in the last 10 y. Cross-study comparisons were difficult due to multiple definitions of RF. One-half of the studies were observational with cross-sectional designs and few interventions were designed to isolate the effect of RF on child undernutrition. Overall, few studies have demonstrated a positive association between RF and child undernutrition, although there is promising evidence that positive caregiver verbalizations during feeding increase child acceptance of food. Recommendations for future research include consensus on the definition and measurement of RF, longitudinal studies that begin early in infancy, and randomized controlled trials that isolate the effect of RF on child undernutrition.",,,4,,,
1600,"Comparative genomic analyses identify common molecular pathways modulated upon exposure to low doses of arsenic and cadmium BACKGROUND: Exposure to the toxic metals arsenic and cadmium is associated with detrimental health effects including cancers of various organs. While arsenic and cadmium are well known to cause adverse health effects at high doses, the molecular impact resulting from exposure to environmentally relevant doses of these metals remains largely unexplored. RESULTS: In this study, we examined the effects of in vitro exposure to either arsenic or cadmium in human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells using genomics and systems level pathway mapping approaches. A total of 167 genes with differential expression were identified following exposure to either metal with surprisingly no overlap between the two. Real-time PCR was used to confirm target gene expression changes. The gene sets were overlaid onto protein-protein interaction maps to identify metal-induced transcriptional networks. Interestingly, both metal-induced networks were significantly enriched for proteins involved in common biological processes such as tumorigenesis, inflammation, and cell signaling. These findings were further supported by gene set enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the transcriptional responses induced by low dose exposure to cadmium and arsenic in human lymphoblastoid cells. These results highlight that even at low levels of exposure both metals can dramatically influence the expression of important cellular pathways.",,,1,,,
1601,"Spatially Modelling the Association Between Access to Recreational Facilities and Exercise: The 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis' Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. However these studies assume that these relationships are invariant over space. In this study, we introduce a novel method to analyze the association between access to recreational facilities and exercise allowing for spatial heterogeneity. In addition, this association is studied before and after controlling for crime, a variable that could explain spatial heterogeneity of associations. We use data from the Chicago site of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis of 781 adults aged 46 years and over. A spatially varying coefficient Tobit regression model is implemented in the Bayesian setting to allow for the association of interest to vary over space. The relationship is shown to vary over Chicago, being positive in the south but negative or null in the north. Controlling for crime weakens the association in the south with little change observed in northern Chicago. The results of this study indicate that spatial heterogeneity in associations of environmental factors with health may vary over space and deserve further exploration.",,,1,,,

This entailed in-depth, semistructured interviews with clinical and administrative staff (n = 70) involved in pilot studies of the nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) at primary health care facilities and rural hospitals. We found that staffs' response fell into four categories: owning, doubting, resisting, and rejecting. Overall, there were positive reactions to the garment as a relevant technology for saving women's lives. Findings will be used for future implementation of the garment and other new technologies.",,,6,,,
1603,"Estimating the cost of no-shows and evaluating the effects of mitigation strategies OBJECTIVE: To measure the cost of nonattendance (""no-shows"") and benefit of overbooking and interventions to reduce no-shows for an outpatient endoscopy suite. METHODS: We used a discrete-event simulation model to determine improved overbooking scheduling policies and examine the effect of no-shows on procedure utilization and expected net gain, defined as the difference in expected revenue based on Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reimbursement rates and variable costs based on the sum of patient waiting time and provider and staff overtime. No-show rates were estimated from historical attendance (18% on average, with a sensitivity range of 12%-24%). We then evaluated the effectiveness of scheduling additional patients and the effect of no-show reduction interventions on the expected net gain. RESULTS: The base schedule booked 24 patients per day. The daily expected net gain with perfect attendance is $4433.32. The daily loss attributed to the base case no-show rate of 18% is $725.42 (16.4% of net gain), ranging from $472.14 to $1019.29 (10.7%-23.0% of net gain). Implementing no-show interventions reduced net loss by $166.61 to $463.09 (3.8%-10.5% of net gain). The overbooking policy of 9 additional patients per day resulted in no loss in expected net gain when compared with the reference scenario. CONCLUSIONS: No-shows can significantly decrease the expected net gain of outpatient procedure centers. Overbooking can help mitigate the impact of no-shows on a suite's expected net gain and has a lower expected cost of implementation to the provider than intervention strategies.",,,5,,,
1604,"Reactions to cigarette taxes and related messaging: is the south different? OBJECTIVES: Given the lag in tobacco control policies in the southeastern US, we examined differences in reactions to tobacco taxes and related messaging among Southeasterners vs. non-Southeasterners. METHODS: In 2013, a cross-sectional online survey using quota-based sampling was conducted assessing tobacco use, attitudes/knowledge regarding tobacco taxation, and reactions to related messaging (health, youth prevention, economic impact, individual rights/responsibility, morality/religion, hospitality). RESULTS: Of 2501 participants, 36.7% were past 30-day smokers; 26.7% were Southeasterners. Compared to others, Southeasterners more likely believed that their state was in the bottom 20 states in tobacco taxes (p < .001) and less likely reported that their taxes were too high (p < .001). Regression analysis indicated that correlates of opposition to increased taxes included being older, having less education, being an infrequent church-attender, and being a current smoker (p's < .001); being a Southeasterner was not associated. Compared to others, Southeasterners were more likely to find pro-tobacco tax messages related to prevention and hospitality as more persuasive (p < .05) and anti-tobacco tax messaging related to the unfairness of tobacco taxes to smokers (p = .050) less persuasive. CONCLUSIONS: Given that Southeasterners are receptive to increased taxation, other factors must contribute to lagging policy and must be addressed.",,,4,,,
1605,"A semiquantitative metric for evaluating clinical actionability of incidental or secondary findings from genome-scale sequencing PURPOSE: As genome-scale sequencing is increasingly applied in clinical scenarios, a wide variety of genomic findings will be discovered as secondary or incidental findings, and there is debate about how they should be handled. The clinical actionability of such findings varies, necessitating standardized frameworks for a priori decision making about their analysis. METHODS: We established a semiquantitative metric to assess five elements of actionability: severity and likelihood of the disease outcome, efficacy and burden of intervention, and knowledge base, with a total score from 0 to 15. RESULTS: The semiquantitative metric was applied to a list of putative actionable conditions, the list of genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for return when deleterious variants are discovered as secondary/incidental findings, and a random sample of 1,000 genes. Scores from the list of putative actionable conditions (median = 12) and the ACMG list (median = 11) were both statistically different than the randomly selected genes (median = 7) (P < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSION: Gene-disease pairs having a score of 11 or higher represent the top quintile of actionability. The semiquantitative metric effectively assesses clinical actionability, promotes transparency, and may facilitate assessments of clinical actionability by various groups and in diverse contexts.Genet Med 18 5, 467-475.",,,1,,,
1606,"Beyond the dinner table: who's having breakfast, lunch and dinner family meals and which meals are associated with better diet quality and BMI in pre-school children? OBJECTIVE: Having frequent family dinners is associated with better diet quality in children; however, it is unknown whether the frequency of certain family meal types (i.e. dinner) is more strongly associated with better child weight and diet quality compared with other meal types (i.e. breakfast, lunch). Thus, the current study examined the frequency of eating breakfast, lunch or dinner family meals and associations with pre-school children's overall diet quality (HEI-2010) and BMI percentile. DESIGN: Cross-sectional baseline data (2012-2014) from two randomized controlled childhood obesity prevention trials, NET-Works and GROW, were analysed together. SETTING: Studies were carried out in community and in-home settings in urban areas of Minnesota and Tennessee, USA. SUBJECTS: Parent-child (ages 2-5 years) pairs from Minnesota (n 222 non-Hispanics; n 312 Hispanics) and Tennessee (n 545 Hispanics; n 55 non-Hispanics) participated in the study. RESULTS: Over 80 % of families ate breakfast or lunch family meals at least once per week. Over 65 % of families ate dinner family meals _5 times/week. Frequency of breakfast family meals and total weekly family meals were significantly associated with healthier diet quality for non-Hispanic pre-school children (P< 0_05), but not for Hispanic children. Family meal frequency by meal type was not associated with BMI percentile for non-Hispanic or Hispanic pre-school children. CONCLUSIONS: Breakfast family meal frequency and total weekly family meal frequency were associated with healthier diet quality in non-Hispanic pre-school children but not in Hispanic children. Longitudinal research is needed to clarify the association between family meal type and child diet quality and BMI percentile.",,,4,,,
1607,"Racial disparities in perinatal outcomes among women with gestational diabetes BACKGROUND: We sought to evaluate perinatal outcomes by race/ethnicity among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: We conducted a 14-year retrospective cohort study of women with GDM. Selected perinatal outcomes were examined. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR, aPR) of perinatal outcomes, comparing Hispanic and African American women with Caucasian women, were calculated. RESULTS: Hispanics comprised 54% of the 1018 woman cohort. Half received medical management of GDM (52%), more than African Americans (45%) or Caucasians (39%)(p< 0.05). Compared with Caucasians, Hispanics had fewer deliveries < 37 weeks (aPR 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.81), less gestational hypertension (aPR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.83), larger median birth weight infants (3453__ vs 3291__, p< 0.05), and greater risk of shoulder dystocia (aPR 3.52, 95% CI 1.30-9.50).

1608,"Excess Maternal Weight Gain and Large for Gestational Age Risk among Women with Gestational Diabetes OBJECTIVE: To determine whether, among women with gestational diabetes (GDM), gestational weight gain above Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines increases the risk of large for gestational age (LGA) neonates. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of singleton term pregnancies with GDM delivered at University of North Carolina Women's Hospital, Chapel Hill, NC from January 2002 to May 2010. We used Poisson regression modeling to estimate LGA risk (birth weight_>_90th percentile for gestational age), by body mass index class and adherence to 2009 IOM weight gain guidelines. Women meeting IOM guidelines were the referent group. Final adjusted models included race/ethnicity, medical management of GDM, and gestational age at delivery. RESULTS: Among the 466 women studied, mean____tandard deviation birth weight was 3,526___544__; 18% (82/466) delivered LGA neonates. Birth weight was greatest among women exceeding, compared with meeting or gaining less than, IOM guidelines (3,703___545 vs. 3,490___505 vs. 3,328___503, p_=_0.001). Exceeding IOM guideline was associated with LGA among obese women (adjusted risk ratio 2.62, 95% confidence interval 1.25, 5.50) but not among overweight or normal weight women. CONCLUSION: Targeting gestational weight gain, a modifiable risk factor, independent of GDM treatment, may decrease LGA risk. Women with GDM may benefit from tailored weight gain recommendations.

1609,"Associations between khat use and HIV risk and status among voluntary counseling and testing center clients in addis ababa, ethiopia OBJECTIVES: Ethiopia is 1 of 15 countries that account for nearly 75% of all people living with HIV. Khat use, a common practice in Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa, has gained attention as a potential risk factor for HIV. Our objective was to evaluate associations between khat use and demographic and risk-taking characteristics (alcohol use, sexual behavior), and also associations between HIV status and these characteristics among voluntary counseling and testing clients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among Pro Pride voluntary counseling and testing center clients, aged 18 to 49 years, from November 2009 to March 2010. All clients were approached, and 98.8% of these (684) completed a self-administered questionnaire. Associations between khat use, alcohol use, multiple sexual partners, and HIV status were assessed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Using khat in the past 90 days (current khat use) was significantly associated with being Muslim, being male, alcohol use, and having a greater number of sex partners in one's lifetime. The adjusted odds of current khat use was almost 7-fold higher in those having 4 or more sexual partners in their lifetime (adjusted odds ratio 6.89, 95% confidence interval 3.87, 12.25) as compared with those with 1 or none. HIV-positive status was significantly associated with age, employment, marital status, number of sex partners in one's lifetime, and khat use. Having used khat in one's lifetime, but not currently, past khat use, was associated with over a 2-fold increased adjusted odds (adjusted odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.13, 6.19) of being HIV-infected. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight associations between current khat use and the modifiable factors of number of lifetime sexual partners and alcohol use. In addition, we observed the association between HIV status and past khat use after adjusting for age, marital status, and number of sex partners in one's lifetime.",,,6,,,
1610,"Health literacy interventions and outcomes: an updated systematic review OBJECTIVES: To update a 2004 systematic review of health care service use and health outcomes related to differences in health literacy level and interventions designed to improve these outcomes for individuals with low health literacy. Disparities in health outcomes and effectiveness of interventions among different sociodemographic groups were also examined. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE_, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, and the Educational Resources Information Center. For health literacy, we searched using a variety of terms, limited to English and studies published from 2003 to May 25, 2010. For numeracy, we searched from 1966 to May 25, 2010. REVIEW METHODS: We used standard Evidence-based Practice Center methods of dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, abstractions, quality ratings, and strength of evidence grading. We resolved disagreements by consensus. We evaluated whether newer literature was available for answering key questions, so we broadened our definition of health literacy to include numeracy and oral (spoken) health literacy. We excluded intervention studies that did not measure health literacy directly and updated our approach to evaluate individual study risk of bias and to grade strength of evidence. RESULTS: We included good- and fair-quality studies: 81 studies addressing health outcomes (reported in 95 articles including 86 measuring health literacy and 16 measuring numeracy, of which 7 measure both) and 42 studies (reported in 45 articles) addressing interventions. Differences in health literacy level were consistently associated with increased hospitalizations, greater emergency care use, lower use of mammography, lower receipt of influenza vaccine, poorer ability to demonstrate taking medications appropriately, poorer ability to interpret labels and health messages, and, among seniors, poorer overall health status and higher mortality. Health literacy level potentially mediates disparities between blacks and whites. The strength of evidence of numeracy studies was insufficient to low, limiting conclusions about the influence of numeracy on health care service use or health outcomes. Two studies suggested numeracy may mediate the effect of disparities on health outcomes. We found no evidence concerning oral health literacy and outcomes. Among intervention studies (27 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 2 cluster RCTs, and 13 quasi-experimental designs), the strength of evidence for specific design features was low or insufficient. However, several specific features seemed to improve comprehension in one or a few studies. The strength of evidence was moderate for the effect of mixed interventions on health care service use; the effect of intensive self-management inventions on behavior; and the effect of disease-management interventions on disease prevalence/severity. The effects of other mixed interventions on other health outcomes, including knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence, and quality of life, and costs were mixed; thus, the strength of evidence was insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The field of health literacy has advanced since the 2004 report. Future research priorities include justifying appropriate cutoffs for health literacy levels prior to conducting studies; developing tools that measure additional related skills, particularly oral (spoken) health literacy; and examining mediators and moderators of the effect of health literacy. Priorities in advancing the design features of interventions include testing novel approaches to increase motivation, techniques for delivering information orally or numerically, ""work around"" interventions such as patient advocates; determining the effective components of already-tested interventions; determining the cost-effectiveness of programs; and determining the effect of policy and practice interventions.",,,7,,,
1611,"A school-based resistance intervention improves skeletal growth in adolescent females SUMMARY: Twenty-two sixth-grade girls who participated in a 7-month school-based resistance-training program were compared to 22 controls. In a subanalysis of Tanner breast II (T2) and III (T3) subjects (n_=_21 controls subjects (CON), n_=_17 subjects in the high-intervention (INT)-dose group (HI)), T2 HI had greater narrow neck (NN) width gains than T2 CON (p_< _0.05) and T3 HI had greater L3 bone mineral density (BMD) gains than T3 CON (p_< _0.05). INTRODUCTION: Physical activity modulates bone growth during adolescence, but an effective activity has not been identified for general use. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a school-based resistance-training program on skeletal growth in pre-menarcheal females. METHODS: Sixth-grade girls participated in a 7-month, resistance-training program (INT) embedded in physical education (PE) classes. Age- and maturity-matched CON from a neighboring school participated in the standard PE classes. INT dose defined high (HI) and low (LO) groups. At baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU), non-INT organized physical activity (PA, hours per week) and maturity status were recorded; DXA scans assessed total body, distal radius, proximal femur, and lumbar spine. Regression models analyzed growth in bone outcomes for HI versus CON, accounting for age, Tanner stage, height, and PA. RESULTS: Forty-four girls (22 HI, 22 CON) were 11.7___0.3 years of age at BL; all were _6 months postmenarche and did not differ in bone growth over the course of the intervention (p_>_0.05). However, in a subanalysis limited to subjects who were T2 or T3 at BL (n_=_21 CON, n_=_17 HI), T2 HI had greater gains in NN width (p_=_0.01) compared to T2 CON, while T3 HI had greater gains in L3 BMD (p_=_0.03) compared to T3 CON. CONCLUSIONS: In a group of T2 and T3 sixth-grade girls, a school-based resistance-training intervention produced maturity-specific differential gains for HI versus CON at the hip and spine.",,,9,,,

Methods: GWAS data on European Caucasians from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph) provided a total of 3857 DLBCL cases and 7666 general-population controls. Data were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Among the 28 SLE-related SNPs investigated, the two most convincingly associated with risk of DLBCL included the CD40 SLE risk allele rs4810485 on chromosome 20q13 (OR per risk allele=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16, p=0.0134), and the HLA SLE risk allele rs1270942 on chromosome 6p21.33 (OR per risk allele=1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36, p=0.0362). Of additional possible interest were rs2205960 and rs12537284. The rs2205960 SNP, related to a cytokine of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily TNFSF4, was associated with an OR per risk allele of 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.16, p=0.0549. The OR for the rs12537284 (chromosome 7q32, IRF5 gene) risk allele was 1.08, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.18, p=0.0765. Conclusions: These data suggest several plausible genetic links between DLBCL and SLE.",,,8,,,
1613,"Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies discovers multiple loci for chronic lymphocytic leukemia Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common lymphoid malignancy with strong heritability. To further understand the genetic susceptibility for CLL and identify common loci associated with risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four genome-wide association studies (GWAS) composed of 3,100 cases and 7,667 controls with follow-up replication in 1,958 cases and 5,530 controls. Here we report three new loci at 3p24.1 (rs9880772, EOMES, P=2.55 _ 10(-11)), 6p25.2 (rs73718779, SERPINB6, P=1.97 _ 10(-8)) and 3q28 (rs9815073, LPP, P=3.62 _ 10(-8)), as well as a new independent SNP at the known 2q13 locus (rs9308731, BCL2L11, P=1.00 _ 10(-11)) in the combined analysis. We find suggestive evidence (P< 5 _ 10(-7)) for two additional new loci at 4q24 (rs10028805, BANK1, P=7.19 _ 10(-8)) and 3p22.2 (rs1274963, CSRNP1, P=2.12 _ 10(-7)).

In a genome-wide search for loci associated with the upper versus the lower 5th percentiles of body mass index, height and waist-to-hip ratio, as well as clinical classes of obesity, including up to 263,407 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 4 new loci (IGFBP4, H6PD, RSRC1 and PPP2R2A) influencing height detected in the distribution tails and 7 new loci (HNF4G, RPTOR, GNAT2, MRPS33P4, ADCY9, HS6ST3 and ZZZ3) for clinical classes of obesity. Further, we find a large overlap in genetic structure and the distribution of variants between traits based on extremes and the general population and little etiological heterogeneity between obesity subgroups.",,,8,,,
1615,"Genome-wide association study identifies multiple risk loci for chronic lymphocytic leukemia Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously identified 13 loci associated with risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). To identify additional CLL susceptibility loci, we conducted the largest meta-analysis for CLL thus far, including four GWAS with a total of 3,100 individuals with CLL (cases) and 7,667 controls. In the meta-analysis, we identified ten independent associated SNPs in nine new loci at 10q23.31 (ACTA2 or FAS (ACTA2/FAS), P=1.22_10(-14)), 18q21.33 (BCL2, P=7.76_10(-11)), 11p15.5 (C11orf21, P=2.15_10(-10)), 4q25 (LEF1, P=4.24_10(-10)), 2q33.1 (CASP10 or CASP8 (CASP10/CASP8), P=2.50_10(-9)), 9p21.3 (CDKN2B-AS1, P=1.27_10(-8)), 18q21.32 (PMAIP1, P=2.51_10(-8)), 15q15.1 (BMF, P=2.71_10(-10)) and 2p22.2 (QPCT, P=1.68_10(-8)), as well as an independent signal at an established locus (2q13, ACOXL, P=2.08_10(-18)). We also found evidence for two additional promising loci below genome-wide significance at 8q22.3 (ODF1, P=5.40_10(-8)) and 5p15.33 (TERT, P=1.92_10(-7)). Although further studies are required, the proximity of several of these loci to genes involved in apoptosis suggests a plausible underlying biological mechanism.",,,8,,,
1616,"A Postpartum Community-Based Weight Management Intervention Designed for Low-Income Women: Feasibility and Initial Efficacy Testing Postpartum weight retention increases a woman's risk of entering subsequent pregnancies overweight or obese, and women who are overweight or obese in pregnancy face higher rates of complications for themselves and their infants. This study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an intervention to prevent postpartum weight retention in predominantly low-income African-American women. A randomized control pilot study was conducted to test the effects of the intervention on weight, adiposity, health behaviors, and eating and exercise self-efficacy from baseline (Time 1) to study completion (Time 2). The women in the experimental group had significantly greater decreases in triceps skinfolds (p = 0.01) and subscapular skinfolds (p = 0.04) and had significantly greater nutrition knowledge (p =0.04) than the control group. The results indicate that women randomized to a postpartum weight management program significantly decreased adiposity, increased nutrition knowledge and action, and, in addition, the women found the intervention acceptable.",,,6,,,

Aim 2 was to test the initial effects of the intervention on the primary outcome of fasting blood glucose and secondary outcomes including metabolic, clinical, adiposity, health behavior, and self-efficacy outcomes in women. Aim 3 examined infant feeding. Infant weight and adiposity growth are discussed in this manuscript. The intervention group received the Phase I intervention, which included 14 classes, each lasting 60 minutes, with the first class delivered during pregnancy on the benefits of breastfeeding for maternal metabolic control andfor infant health. The classes resumed 6 weeks postpartum and were delivered weekly. The Phase II intervention included 3 monthly classes, each lasting 60 minutes, during which the interventionist facilitated a group discussion and assisted the women with problems related to breastfeeding, nutrition, or exercise. Results demonstrated that 100 women were enrolled in the study; however, secondary to the majority of women returning to work part-time or full-time, the retention for the intervention and data collection was poor. In addition, statistical significancefor the primary outcomes was not achieved. However, women made some changes in adiposity and health behaviors, and infants made changes in adiposity growth.

1618,"Rationale, design, methodology and sample characteristics for the family partners for health study: a cluster randomized controlled study BACKGROUND: Young children who are overweight are at increased risk of becoming obese and developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. Therefore, early intervention is critical. This paper describes the rationale, design, methodology, and sample characteristics of a 5-year cluster randomized controlled trial being conducted in eight elementary schools in rural North Carolina, United States. METHODS/DESIGN: The first aim of the trial is to examine the effects of a two-phased intervention on weight status, adiposity, nutrition and exercise health behaviors, and self-efficacy in overweight or obese 2nd, 3 rd, and 4th grade children and their overweight or obese parents. The primary outcome in children is stabilization of BMI percentile trajectory from baseline to 18 months. The primary outcome in parents is a decrease in BMI from baseline to 18 months. Secondary outcomes for both children and parents include adiposity, nutrition and exercise health behaviors, and self-efficacy from baseline to 18 months. A secondary aim of the trial is to examine in the experimental group, the relationships between parents and children's changes in weight status, adiposity, nutrition and exercise health behaviors, and self-efficacy. An exploratory aim is to determine whether African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white children and parents in the experimental group benefit differently from the intervention in weight status, adiposity, health behaviors, and self-efficacy.A total of 358 African American, non-Hispanic white, and bilingual Hispanic children with a BMI _ 85th percentile and 358 parents with a BMI _ 25 kg/m_ have been inducted over 3 1/2 years and randomized by cohort to either an experimental or a wait-listed control group. The experimental group receives a 12-week intensive intervention of nutrition and exercise education, coping skills training and exercise (Phase I), 9 months of continued monthly contact (Phase II) and then 6 months (follow-up) on their own. Safety endpoints include adverse event reporting. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied to all data. DISCUSSION: Findings from this trial may lead to an effective intervention to assist children and parents to work together to improve nutrition and exercise patterns by making small lifestyle pattern changes.

Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory study was to compare whether African American and white children and parents benefitted equally from a community-based weight management intervention delivered in two rural counties in southeastern North Carolina (N.C.). METHODS: We compared the efficacy of the Family Partners for Health intervention for African American and white children and their parents by testing the three-way interaction of the intervention group according to visit and race. RESULTS: African American children in the intervention group weighed significantly (P_=_0.027) less than those in the control group, while white children in the intervention group weighed less than those in the control group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. African American and white parents in the intervention group weighed less than their respective control groups across all three data collections, but the difference was only significant in the group of white parents (P_=_0.010) at the completion of the study. At the completion of the study, African American children in the intervention group received significantly (P_=_0.003) more support for physical activity than African American children in the control group. At both time points, white children in the intervention group were not significantly different from those in the control group. African American parents in the intervention group scored slightly worse in the stress management assessment compared to those in the control group, while white parents in the intervention group showed a significantly (P_=_0.041) better level of stress management than those in the control group. At the completion of the study, African American parents in the intervention group scored somewhat worse in emotional eating self-efficacy compared to the scores of the African American parents in the control group, while white parents in the intervention group scored significantly (P_< _0.001) better than those in the control group.

1620,"A cluster randomized controlled trial for child and parent weight management: children and parents randomized to the intervention group have correlated changes in adiposity Background: Studies have suggested that obesity is linked within families and that successful interventions involve both the parent and child with obesity. However little information exists regarding similarities in adiposity and weight loss between the parent and child, especially in low socio-economic ethnically diverse households. Methods: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between the changes from baseline over time in adiposity, weight, health behaviors, and self-efficacy in children (n_=_184) and parents (n_=_184) participating in an 18-month weight loss program. Within the intervention group only and for each post-baseline time point, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for children's changes (from baseline) in adiposity, weight,_health behaviors, and self-efficacy, with their parents' corresponding changes from baseline, to determine how strongly the dyads were correlated. Results: At the completion of 18_months, the intervention group parents demonstrated strong positive correlations between parent and child change in waist circumference (r_=_0.409, p_< _0.001), triceps (r_=_0.332, p_< _0.001), and subscapular (r_=_0.292, p_=_0.002) skinfolds. There were no significant correlations between weight, health behaviors, eating, and exercise self-efficacy.

Recruitment and retention on both district and school levels and child and parent levels are discussed. A total of 358 children and 358 parents from eight schools in rural North Carolina participated in a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a nutrition and exercise education, coping skills training, and exercise intervention. Recruitment and retention at the district and school level included meeting with superintendents and receiving a proper introduction to school principals and consistently clear communication throughout the study. At the school level, relationships were developed with the principal and other key personnel to keep lines of communication open during the study. Recruitment and retention strategies at the child and parent level included allowing adequate time for questions during consent and assent and providing a free nutrition and exercise program, a light meal, homework assistance, child care for other children who came to the program, and transportation vouchers if needed. Successful recruitment and retention strategies at the district and school levels and child and parent levels are important for conducting longitudinal community-based studies. _ 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,0,,,

To date, there have been few interdisciplinary interventions that target predominantly ethnic minority low-income women diagnosed with GDM. This paper describes the rationale, design and methodology of a 2-year, randomized, controlled study being conducted in North Carolina. METHODS/DESIGN: Using a two-group, repeated measures, experimental design, we will test a 14- week intensive intervention on the benefits of breastfeeding, understanding gestational diabetes and risk of progression to prediabetes and T2DM, nutrition and exercise education, coping skills training, physical activity (Phase I), educational and motivational text messaging and 3_months of continued monthly contact (Phase II). A total of 100 African American, non-Hispanic white, and bilingual Hispanic women between 22-36_weeks of pregnancy who are diagnosed with GDM and their infants will be randomized to either the experimental group or the wait-listed control group. The first aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of the intervention. The second aim of study is to test the effects of the intervention on maternal outcomes from baseline (22-36_weeks pregnant) to 10_months postpartum. Primary maternal outcomes will include fasting blood glucose and weight (BMI) from baseline to 10_months postpartum. Secondary maternal outcomes will include clinical, adiposity, health behaviors and self-efficacy outcomes from baseline to 10_months postpartum. The third aim of the study is to quantify the effects of the intervention on infant feeding and growth. Infant outcomes will include weight status and breastfeeding from birth through 10_months of age. Data analysis will include general linear mixed-effects models. Safety endpoints include adverse event reporting. DISCUSSION: Findings from this trial may lead to an effective intervention to assist women diagnosed with GDM to improve maternal glucose homeostasis and weight as well as stabilize infant growth trajectory, reducing the burden of metabolic disease across two generations.

1623,"The family partners for health study: a cluster randomized controlled trial for child and parent weight management OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test a two-phased nutrition and exercise education, coping skills training, and exercise intervention program for overweight or obese low-income ethnic minority 2nd to 4th grade children and their parents in rural North Carolina, USA. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out with 358 children (7-10 years) and a parent for each child (n=358). General linear mixed models were used to determine the effects of the intervention on weight, adiposity, health behaviors, and eating and exercise self-efficacy by examining changes in children and parents from baseline to completion of the study (18 months). RESULTS: At 18 months, children in the experimental group did not have a significantly decreased body mass index (BMI) percentile (P=0.470); however, they showed a reduction in the growth rate of their triceps (P=0.001) and subscapular skinfolds (P< 0.001) and an improvement in dietary knowledge (P=0.018) and drank less than one glass of soda per day (P=0.052) compared with the control group. Parents in the experimental group had decreased BMI (P=0.001), triceps (P< 0.001) and subscapular skinfolds (P< 0.001) and increased nutrition (P=0.003) and exercise (P< 0.001) knowledge and more often drank water or unsweetened drinks (P=0.029). At 18 months, children in the experimental group did not show significant improvement in eating (P=0.956) or exercise self-efficacy (P=0.976). Experimental parents demonstrated improved socially acceptable eating self-efficacy (P=0.013); however, they did not show significant improvement in self-efficacy pertaining to emotional eating (P=0.155) and exercise (P=0.680). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that inclusion of children and parents in the same intervention program is an effective way to decrease adiposity and improve nutrition behaviors in both children and parents and improve weight and eating self-efficacy in parents.",,,1,,,
1624,"Social environment and HIV risk among MSM in Hanoi and Thai Nguyen Little is known about the effect of the social environment on HIV risk in gay men in northern Vietnam, particularly in rural areas. This qualitative research study conducted 4 key informant interviews and 30 in-depth interviews of men in two northern Vietnamese cities: Hanoi, a large city, and Thai Nguyen, a smaller town. Hanoi has experienced a growth in the number of places where gay men can socialize, access HIV prevention services, and discuss health issues. Thai Nguyen lacks these open venues. However, homosexuality is still highly stigmatized in the general population in both cities. This stigma affects the number of partners and level of sexual risk of participants. Also, men generally reported little communication between partners about sexual risk. While stigma in the general community is difficult to change, social environments where gay men can openly communicate creates an opportunity for HIV prevention and social support.",,,2,,,
1625,"Risk factors for estrogen receptor positive ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast in African American women BACKGROUND: Compared to U.S. white women, African American women are more likely to die from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Elucidation of risk factors for DCIS in African American women may provide opportunities for risk reduction. METHODS: We used data from three epidemiologic studies in the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium to study risk factors for estrogen receptor (ER) positive DCIS (488 cases; 13,830 controls). Results were compared to associations observed for ER+_invasive breast cancer (n_=_2,099). RESULTS: First degree family history of breast cancer was associated with increased risk of ER+_DCIS [odds ratio (OR): 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31, 2.17]. Oral contraceptive use within the past 10 years (vs. never) was also associated with increased risk (OR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.97), as was late age at first birth (_25 years vs. < 20 years) (OR: 1.26, 95%CI: 0.96, 1.67). Risk was reduced in women with older age at menarche (_15 years vs. < 11 years) (OR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.42, 0.93) and higher body mass index (BMI) in early adulthood (_25 vs. < 20_kg/m2 at age 18 or 21) (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.55, 1.01). There was a positive association of recent BMI with risk in postmenopausal women only. In general, associations of risk factors for ER+_DCIS were similar in magnitude and direction to those for invasive ER+_breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most risk factors for invasive ER+_breast cancer are also associated with increased risk of ER+_DCIS among African American women.

1626,"Adaptation of an Evidence-Based Cardiovascular Health Intervention for Rural African Americans in the Southeast BACKGROUND: African Americans (AA) living in the southeast United States have the highest prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and rural minorities bear a significant burden of co-occurring CVD risk factors. Few evidence-based interventions (EBI) address social and physical environmental barriers in rural minority communities. We used intervention mapping together with community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to adapt objectives of a multi-component CVD lifestyle EBI to fit the needs of a rural AA community. We sought to describe the process of using CPBR to adapt an EBI using intervention mapping to an AA rural setting and to identify and document the adaptations mapped onto the EBI and how they enhance the intervention to meet community needs. METHODS: Focus groups, dyadic interviews, and organizational web-based surveys were used to assess content interest, retention strategies, and incorporation of auxiliary components to the EBI. Using CBPR principles, community and academic stakeholders met weekly to collaboratively integrate formative research findings into the intervention mapping process. We used a framework developed by Wilstey Stirman et al. to document changes. RESULTS: Key changes were made to the content, context, and training and evaluation components of the existing EBI. A matrix including behavioral objectives from the original EBI and new objectives was developed. Categories of objectives included physical activity, nutrition, alcohol, and tobacco divided into three levels, namely, individual, interpersonal, and environmental. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention mapping integrated with principles of CBPR is an efficient and flexible process for adapting a comprehensive and culturally appropriate lifestyle EBI for a rural AA community context.",,,9,,,
1627,"Genetic analysis of hsCRP in American Indians: The Strong Heart Family Study BACKGROUND: Increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an important component of the innate immune response, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression and risk of colon cancer (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of American Indian populations. METHODS: The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and association analyses. RESULTS: CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 _ 0.05, p< 1.3 X 10-20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold < 7.77 x 10-7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes 2, 5, 6(2 loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7.2 X 10-4. CONCLUSION: In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other chromosomes that warrant further investigation.",,,8,,,
1628,"Family history of cancer in relation to breast cancer subtypes in african american women BACKGROUND: The evidence on the relation of family history of cancers other than breast cancer to breast cancer risk is conflicting, and most studies have not assessed specific breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: We assessed the relation of first-degree family history of breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, ovarian, and cervical cancer and lymphoma or leukemia, to the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), ER(-), and triple-negative breast cancer in data from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: There were 3,023 ER(+) and 1,497 ER(-) breast cancer cases (including 696 triple-negative cases) and 17,420 controls. First-degree family history of breast cancer was associated with increased risk of each subtype: OR = 1.76 (95% CI, 1.57-1.97) for ER(+), 1.67 (1.42-1.95) for ER(-), and 1.72 (1.38-2.13) for triple-negative breast cancer. Family history of cervical cancer was associated with increased risk of ER(-) (OR = 2.39; 95% CI, 1.36-4.20), but not ER(+) cancer. Family history of both breast and prostate cancer was associated with increased risk of ER(+) (3.40; 2.42-4.79) and ER(-) (2.09; 1.21-3.63) cancer, but family history of both breast and lung cancer was associated only with ER(-) cancer (2.11; 1.29-3.46). CONCLUSIONS: A family history of cancers other than breast may influence the risk of breast cancer, and associations may differ by subtype. IMPACT: Greater surveillance and counseling for additional screening may be warranted for women with a family history of cancer. _2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",,,3,,,
1629,"A case-control analysis of oral contraceptive use and breast cancer subtypes in the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium INTRODUCTION: Recent oral contraceptive (OC) use has been consistently associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but evidence on specific breast cancer subtypes is sparse. METHODS: We investigated recency and duration of OC use in relation to molecular subtypes of breast cancer in a pooled analysis of data from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium. The study included 1,848 women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, 1,043 with ER-negative (ER-) breast cancer (including 494 triple negative (TN) tumors, which do not have receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor 2), and 10,044 controls. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for exposure categories relative to never use, controlling for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: OC use within the previous 5 years was associated with increased risk of ER+ (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.81), ER- (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), and TN (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.53) breast cancer. The risk declined after cessation of use but was apparent for ER+ cancer for 15 to 19 years after cessation and for ER- breast cancer for an even longer interval after cessation. Long duration of use was also associated with increased risk of each subtype, particularly ER-. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that OC use, particularly recent use of long duration, is associated with an increased risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer in African American women. Research into mechanisms that explain these findings, especially the association with ER- breast cancer, is needed.",,,3,,,
1630,"Opportunities and challenges of Web 2.0 for vaccination decisions A growing number of people use the Internet to obtain health information, including information about vaccines. Websites that allow and promote interaction among users are an increasingly popular source of health information. Users of such so-called Web 2.0 applications (e.g. social media), while still in the minority, represent a growing proportion of online communicators, including vocal and active anti-vaccination groups as well as public health communicators. In this paper, the authors: define Web 2.0 and examine how it may influence vaccination decisions; discuss how anti-vaccination movements use Web 2.0 as well as the challenges Web 2.0 holds for public health communicators; describe the types of information used in these different settings; introduce the theoretical background that can be used to design effective vaccination communication in a Web 2.0 environment; make recommendations for practice and pose open questions for future research. The authors conclude that, as a result of the Internet and Web 2.0, private and public concerns surrounding vaccinations have the potential to virally spread across the globe in a quick, efficient and vivid manner. Web 2.0 may influence vaccination decisions by delivering information that alters the perceived personal risk of vaccine-preventable diseases or vaccination side-effects. It appears useful for public health officials to put effort into increasing the effectiveness of existing communication by implementing interactive, customized communication. A key step to providing successful public health communication is to identify those who are particularly vulnerable to finding and using unreliable and misleading information. Thus, it appears worthwhile that public health websites strive to be easy to find, easy to use, attractive in its presentation and readily provide the information, support and advice that the searcher is looking for. This holds especially when less knowledgeable individuals are in need of reliable information about vaccination risks and benefits. Copyright _ 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,0,,,
1631,"Meeting Medicare requirements for transitional care: Do stroke care and policy align? OBJECTIVE: This study (1) describes transitional care for stroke patients discharged home from hospitals, (2) compares hospitals' standards of transitional care with core transitional care management (TCM) components recognized by Medicare, and (3) examines the association of policy and hospital specialty designations with TCM implementation. METHODS: Hospitals participating in the Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) Study provided data on their hospital, stroke patient population, and standards of transitional care. Hospital-reported transitional care strategies were compared with the federal TCM definition (2-day follow-up, 14-day visit, non-face-to-face services). We examined the associations of TCM billing, stroke center certification, and Magnet nursing excellence designation with TCM implementation. RESULTS: Transitional care varied widely among 41 hospitals in North Carolina and no one strategy was universally applied or provided across hospitals. One third of hospitals met the TCM definition (37% provided telephone follow-up, 76% provided face-to-face provider follow-up, all provided a type of non-face-to-face support). There were no differences between groups (TCM met/not met) in hospital characteristics or transitional care resources and processes. Stroke center certification, Magnet designation, and use of TCM billing codes were not different for hospitals that did and did not meet the TCM definition. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial variation in the provision of strategies supporting stroke patients' transition home from the hospital. Supportive stroke care transitions are essential when more than 50% of stroke patients are discharged home and more than half experience moderate to severe strokes. More research is needed to identify drivers of TCM uptake. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02588664. _ 2019 American Academy of Neurology.",,,0,,,
1632,"GSK2801, a BAZ2/BRD9 Bromodomain Inhibitor, Synergizes with BET Inhibitors to Induce Apoptosis in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Screening of an inhibitor library targeting kinases and epigenetic regulators identified several molecules having antiproliferative synergy with extraterminal domain (BET) bromodomain (BD) inhibitors (JQ1, OTX015) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). GSK2801, an inhibitor of BAZ2A/B BDs, of the imitation switch chromatin remodeling complexes, and BRD9, of the SWI/SNF complex, demonstrated synergy independent of BRD4 control of P-TEFb-mediated pause-release of RNA polymerase II. GSK2801 or RNAi knockdown of BAZ2A/B with JQ1 selectively displaced BRD2 at promoters/enhancers of ETS-regulated genes. Additional displacement of BRD2 from rDNA in the nucleolus coincided with decreased 45S rRNA, revealing a function of BRD2 in regulating RNA polymerase I transcription. In 2D cultures, enhanced displacement of BRD2 from chromatin by combination drug treatment induced senescence. In spheroid cultures, combination treatment induced cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP characteristic of apoptosis in tumor cells. Thus, GSK2801 blocks BRD2-driven transcription in combination with BET inhibitor and induces apoptosis of TNBC. IMPLICATIONS: Synergistic inhibition of BDs encoded in BAZ2A/B, BRD9, and BET proteins induces apoptosis of TNBC by a combinatorial suppression of ribosomal DNA transcription and ETS-regulated genes. _2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",,,3,,,
1633,"Monetary Value of Diet Is Associated with Dietary Quality and Nutrient Adequacy among Urban Adults, Differentially by Sex, Race and Poverty Status OBJECTIVE: The association between monetary value of the diet (MVD, $/day) with dietary quality was examined using a large sample of urban US adults, differentially by socio-demographic factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 2,111 participants, aged 30-64y, using data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Study. Dietary quality indices included Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) and Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR), (two 24-hr recalls). A national food price database was used to estimate MVD. Multiple linear/logistic regression analyses were conducted stratifying separately by sex, race and poverty status. RESULTS: Women had significantly higher HEI-2010 scores than men (43.35 vs 41.57 out of 100, respectively), whereas MAR scores were higher for men (76.8 vs 69.9, out of 100), reflecting energy intake gender differentials. Importantly, a $3/day higher MVD (IQR: $3.70/d (Q1) to $6.62/d (Q4)) was associated with a 4.98_0.35 higher total HEI-2010 and a 3.88_0.37 higher MAR score, after energy-adjustment and control for key confounders. For HEI-2010 and MAR, stronger associations were observed among participants above poverty and among women, whilethe MVD vs. HEI-2010 association was additionally stronger among Whites. Sex and poverty status differentials were observed for many MAR and some HEI-2010 components. CONCLUSIONS: Despite positive associations between measures of dietary quality and MVD, particularly above poverty and among women, approaching compliance with the Dietary Guidelines (80 or more for HEI-2010) requires a substantially higher MVD. Thus, nutrition education may further improve people's decision-making regarding food venues and dietary choices.",,,4,,,
1634,"Longitudinal Associations between Monetary Value of the Diet, DASH Diet Score and the Allostatic Load among Middle-Aged Urban Adults Lower cost can lead to poorer-quality diets, potentially worsening metabolic profiles. We explored these pathways among urban adults. Longitudinal data were extracted from 1224-1479 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. DASH(mean) (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) score was computed using four 24 h recalls (v1/v2: 2004-2013) linked with a national food price database to estimate monetary value of the diet [MVD(mean)]. Allostatic load (AL) was measured at visits 2 (v2) and 3 (v3) in 2009-2018. Mixed-effects regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted, linking MVD(mean)/DASH(mean) to AL [v2 and annual change(v3-v2)] and exploring mediating pathways between MVD(mean) and AL(v3) through DASH(mean), stratifying by sex, race and poverty status. MVD(mean) tertiles were linearly associated with contemporaneous DASH(mean), after energy adjustment. In mixed-effects regression models, DASH(mean) was consistently linked to lower AL(v2). DASH(mean) and MVD(mean) were positively associated with higher serum albumin(v2). In SEM, MVD(mean) was linked to AL(v3) through DASH(mean), mainly among Whites and specifically for the cholesterol and Waist-Hip-Ratio AL components. In summary, energy and other covariate-adjusted increase in MVD may have a sizeable impact on DASH which can reduce follow-up AL among urban White middle-aged adults. More studies are needed to replicate findings in comparable samples of urban adults.",,,6,,,
1635,"Integrating palliative care information and hospice referral in medicaid primary care BACKGROUND: Hospice and palliative care (PC) remain underutilized by Medicaid patients. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate an intervention to improve communication about advance care planning (ACP) and symptom distress, and to facilitate referral to PC and hospice. METHODS: We conducted a study in a statewide Medicaid primary care network with 510 Medicaid care managers (CMs). PC experts collaborated with leaders in the statewide primary care network on a quality improvement intervention. Training components included education and engagement with local hospice and PC providers. Quality improvement components included feedback of quality measures and a practice toolkit. Evaluation used participant surveys and tracking of key quality measures: 1) percent of at-risk subset of aged, blind, and disabled (ABD) Medicaid patients asked about ACP or symptom distress; 2) cumulative number of ABD Medicaid PC or hospice referrals; and 3) the percent of all nondual ABD Medicaid decedents enrolled in hospice. RESULTS: After training, CMs identified the following areas for expected practice change: ACP (29%), identifying/referring patients for hospice or PC (25%), supporting patients and families (21%), toolkit utilization (10%), and engaging medical providers (10%). Over one-year follow-up the percent of moderate and high-risk ABD Medicaid patients asked about ACP or symptoms increased from 7% to 31% and 8% to 41%, respectively (p< 0.001). The cumulative number of PC or hospice referrals increased from 8 to 155. Hospice enrollment at death was unchanged (29% to 30%, p=NS [nonsignificant]). CONCLUSIONS: A statewide intervention targeting CMs in a Medicaid primary care practice network is effective to increase communication and hospice and PC referrals; longer follow-up may be required to determine effect on hospice use.",,,2,,,
1636,"Imputation method for lifetime exposure assessment in air pollution epidemiologic studies BACKGROUND: Environmental epidemiology, when focused on the life course of exposure to a specific pollutant, requires historical exposure estimates that are difficult to obtain for the full time period due to gaps in the historical record, especially in earlier years. We show that these gaps can be filled by applying multiple imputation methods to a formal risk equation that incorporates lifetime exposure. We also address challenges that arise, including choice of imputation method, potential bias in regression coefficients, and uncertainty in age-at-exposure sensitivities. METHODS: During time periods when parameters needed in the risk equation are missing for an individual, the parameters are filled by an imputation model using group level information or interpolation. A random component is added to match the variance found in the estimates for study subjects not needing imputation. The process is repeated to obtain multiple data sets, whose regressions against health data can be combined statistically to develop confidence limits using Rubin's rules to account for the uncertainty introduced by the imputations. To test for possible recall bias between cases and controls, which can occur when historical residence location is obtained by interview, and which can lead to misclassification of imputed exposure by disease status, we introduce an ""incompleteness index,"" equal to the percentage of dose imputed (PDI) for a subject. ""Effective doses"" can be computed using different functional dependencies of relative risk on age of exposure, allowing intercomparison of different risk models. To illustrate our approach, we quantify lifetime exposure (dose) from traffic air pollution in an established case-control study on Long Island, New York, where considerable in-migration occurred over a period of many decades. RESULTS: The major result is the described approach to imputation. The illustrative example revealed potential recall bias, suggesting that regressions against health data should be done as a function of PDI to check for consistency of results. The 1% of study subjects who lived for long durations near heavily trafficked intersections, had very high cumulative exposures. Thus, imputation methods must be designed to reproduce non-standard distributions. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach meets a number of methodological challenges to extending historical exposure reconstruction over a lifetime and shows promise for environmental epidemiology. Application to assessment of breast cancer risks will be reported in a subsequent manuscript.",,,1,,,
1637,"Psychometric Properties of the Four-Item Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study Participants OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the reliability and factorial validity of the four-item Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale (MGLS) among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants. METHODS: We used the cross-sectional visit 5 data from the ARIC Study to assess the measurement properties of the MGLS. We measured the internal consistency using Cronbach _ (where _ > 0.70 is considered reliable for group-level measurement), the response frequency, and the inter item correlation. Factor analysis of the MGLS and five other adherence items in the survey was conducted using a polychoric correlation matrix to examine the dimensionality that underlies the MGLS. A vanishing tetrad test was conducted to assess conformity with an effect indicator model. RESULTS: Among the ARIC visit 5 participants, 6,261 (96%) responded to the MGLS and other questions related to medication adherence in the survey (mean age 76 _ 5 years, 59% women). The Cronbach _ for the MGLS was 0.47. The inter-item correlations ranged from 0.11 to 0.26. In the factor analysis of the medication adherence survey questions, a three-factor solution was used. One factor captured the extent of nonadherence, whereas other factors focused on the reasons for nonadherence. The MGLS items spread out across the factors that reflect the extent of as well as the reasons for nonadherence. The results of the vanishing tetrad test indicated that the MGLS consists of items other than effect indicators (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The low reliability together with the factor analysis findings imply that the MGLS may reflect causes as well as the extent of medication adherence. The findings suggest that the MGLS, as presently used, lacks consistency in an elderly population. Copyright _ 2016 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

1638,"Depression and coping strategies among Vietnamese women living with HIV: A qualitative study Women living with HIV (WLWH) are more likely to suffer from depression than seronegative women and are also more likely to suffer from depression than men living with HIV. There is limited depression research with WLWH in Vietnam. Twenty in-depth interviews with WLWH were conducted to identify pathways leading to depression and coping strategies for depression. Participants were recruited from an antiretroviral treatment clinic in northern Vietnam. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed, translated, and analysed to identify key themes. All participants reported sudden loss of social support, debilitating depression, and suicidal ideation in the first six months after HIV diagnosis. While some were able to cope with their status after several months, others continued to struggle due to HIV-related stigma that was perceived as more isolating for WLWH than for men. Women who were able to effectively cope with depression found ways to re-establish connections to family and community. Interventions to improve mental wellbeing should link WLWH to mental health services immediately after diagnosis and address loss of support and stigma, as they contributed to the onset and persistence of depression after HIV diagnosis. Community-level HIV stigma reduction interventions may also help repair broken social bonds and foster new ones.",,,6,,,
1639,"The effect of cash transfers and household vulnerability on food security in zimbabwe We study the impact of the Zimbabwe Harmonized Social Cash Transfer (HSCT) on household food security after 12 months of implementation. We investigate determinants of food security as measured by a well-known food security scale - the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - and as measured by value of household food consumption composed of own-production, market purchases and gifts received. We find that several dimensions of household vulnerability correlate more strongly with the food security measure than with food consumption. Labor constraints, which is a key vulnerability criterion used by the HSCT to target households, is an important predictor of the food security score but not food consumption, and its effect on food security is even larger during the lean season. Impact analysis shows that the program has had statistically significant impacts on Food Security and Diet Diversity scores but null to low impacts on food consumption. However aggregate food consumption hides dynamic activity taking place within the household where the cash is used to obtain more food from the market and rely less on food received as gifts. The cash in turn gives beneficiaries greater choice in their food basket, which improves diet diversity.",,,1,,,
1640,"The role of helplessness, outcome expectation for exercise and literacy in predicting disability and symptoms in older adults with arthritis OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of outcome expectation for exercise (OEE), helplessness, and literacy on arthritis outcomes in 2 community-based lifestyle randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in urban and rural communities with older adults with arthritis. METHODS: Data from 391 participants in 2 RCTs were combined to examine associations of 2 psychosocial variables: helplessness and OEE, and literacy with arthritis outcomes. Arthritis outcomes namely, the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and arthritis symptoms pain, fatigue and stiffness Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), were measured at baseline and at the end of the interventions. Complete baseline and post-intervention data were analyzed using STATA version 9. RESULTS: Disability after intervention was not predicted by helplessness, literacy, or OEE in the adjusted model. Arthritis symptoms after the intervention were all significantly predicted by helplessness at various magnitudes in adjusted models, but OEE and literacy were not significant predictors. CONCLUSION: When literacy, helplessness, and OEE were examined as predictors of arthritis outcomes in intervention trials, they did not predict disability. However, helplessness predicted symptoms of pain, fatigue, and stiffness, but literacy did not predict symptoms. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future sustainable interventions may include self-management components that address decreasing helplessness to improve arthritis outcomes. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1641,"Associations between low literacy and health status measures: cross-sectional analyses of two physical activity trials Arthritis researchers have thoroughly documented a powerful relationship between years of education and health outcomes, but they have not documented the role of literacy. The authors examined the associations between literacy and arthritis health status measures. Participants were recruited from southeastern urban and rural areas. Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, which provides an estimate of reading level in less than 3 minutes, was administered to 447 participants at baseline in 2 community-based randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions designed for aging sedentary adults with arthritis. Those who read below ninth grade were considered to have low literacy. Among the 447 study participants, the median sample age was 69 years. A majority of the participants were women (86%), Caucasian (80%), overweight or obese (72%). Of all participants, 20% had low literacy. Significantly more African Americans (54%) than Caucasians (12%) had low literacy levels (p < .001). Individuals with low literacy did not have significantly worse disability or arthritis symptoms than individuals with adequate literacy (all ps > .05). Among our study participants, 1 in 5 had low literacy, but literacy was not associated with health status in this population. Copyright _ Taylor & Francis Group, LLC",,,9,,,
1642,"Travel-related behaviors, opinions, and concerns of U.S. adult drivers by race/ethnicity, 2010 INTRODUCTION: The U.S. population is shifting to become both older and more racially and ethnically diverse. Our current understanding of U.S. drivers' travel-related needs and concerns by race/ethnicity is limited. METHODS: Data from the 2010 HealthStyles survey, an annual, cross-sectional, national mail-panel survey of persons ages 18 years or older living in the United States, were used to calculate weighted percentages of travel-related behaviors, opinions, and concerns by race/ethnicity. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between race/ethnicity and specific travel-related concerns, while adjusting for other demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Adequate transportation alternatives to driving were reported by a greater percentage of persons in certain minority groups compared to whites (Hispanic: 34.7%; white: 23.4%). Concern for the availability of alternatives to driving in the future was greater among minority groups (black: 57.7%; Hispanic: 47.3%; other: 50.9%) compared to whites (37.5%). Additionally, among persons with a household income of $25,000+, minorities were generally more likely than whites to report concern about having alternative transportation options to driving, whereas concern was consistently high among all racial/ethnic groups for those earning less than $25,000 annually. In each racial/ethnic group, more than 10% of persons reported not knowing how they would get around if they could no longer drive. CONCLUSIONS: Important variations by race/ethnicity in both travel behaviors and concerns for adequate alternatives to driving were found, revealing the need for further research to better understand reasons for these differences and to identify ways to meet the transportation needs of the changing U.S. population demographics. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Further research on adequate alternatives to driving and transportation needs is needed. _ 2013.",,,4,,,
1643,"Testosterone replacement therapy among HIV-infected men in the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine the rate of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) initiation, TRT predictors and associated monitoring in HIV-infected men. DESIGN: A multisite cohort study. METHODS: We examined TRT initiation rates and monitoring among adult HIV-infected men in routine care at seven sites in the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) from 1996 to 2011. We determined TRT predictors using Cox regression modelling. RESULTS: Of 14_454 men meeting inclusion criteria, TRT was initiated in 1482 (10%) with an initiation rate of 19.7/1000 person-years [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 18.7-20.7]. In the multivariable model, TRT was significantly associated with age at least 35 years, white race, diagnosis of AIDS wasting, hepatitis C coinfection, protease inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy and nadir CD4 cell count of 200__ells/_l or less. Overall, 1886 out of 14_454 (13%) had testosterone deficiency. Among those initiating TRT, 992 out of 1482 (67%) had a pre-TRT serum total testosterone measured, and deficiency [< 300__g/dl (10.4__mol/l)] was found in 360 out of 1482 (24%). Post-TRT serum total testosterone was measured within 6 months of TRT initiation in 377 out of 1482 (25%) men. CONCLUSION: TRT was common in HIV-infected men, though evidence for pre-TRT testosterone deficiency was lacking in 76%. Endocrine guidelines for post-TRT monitoring were uncommonly followed. Given cardiovascular and other risks associated with TRT, efforts should focus on understanding factors driving these TRT practices in HIV-infected men.",,,5,,,

1645,"Discriminative Accuracy of FEV1:FVC Thresholds for COPD-Related Hospitalization and Mortality Importance: According to numerous current guidelines, the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires a ratio of the forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity (FEV1:FVC) of less than 0.70, yet this fixed threshold is based on expert opinion and remains controversial. Objective: To determine the discriminative accuracy of various FEV1:FVC fixed thresholds for predicting COPD-related hospitalization and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Pooled Cohorts Study harmonized and pooled data from 4 US general population-based cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study; Cardiovascular Health Study; Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study; and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Participants aged 45 to 102 years were enrolled from 1987 to 2000 and received follow-up longitudinally through 2016. Exposures: Presence of airflow obstruction, which was defined by a baseline FEV1:FVC less than a range of fixed thresholds (0.75 to 0.65) or less than the lower limit of normal as defined by Global Lung Initiative reference equations (LLN). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of COPD hospitalization and COPD-related mortality, defined by adjudication or administrative criteria. The optimal fixed FEV1:FVC threshold was defined by the best discrimination for these COPD-related events as indexed using the Harrell C statistic from unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Differences in C statistics were compared with respect to less than 0.70 and less than LLN thresholds using a nonparametric approach. Results: Among 24_207 adults in the pooled cohort (mean [SD] age at enrollment, 63 [10.5] years; 12_990 [54%] women; 16_794 [69%] non-Hispanic white; 15_181 [63%] ever smokers), complete follow-up was available for 11_077 (77%) at 15 years. During a median follow-up of 15 years, 3925 participants experienced COPD-related events over 340_757 person-years of follow-up (incidence density rate, 11.5 per 1000 person-years), including 3563 COPD-related hospitalizations and 447 COPD-related deaths. With respect to discrimination of COPD-related events, the optimal fixed threshold (0.71; C statistic for optimal fixed threshold, 0.696) was not significantly different from the 0.70 threshold (difference, 0.001 [95% CI, -0.002 to 0.004]) but was more accurate than the LLN threshold (difference, 0.034 [95% CI, 0.028 to 0.041]). The 0.70 threshold provided optimal discrimination in the subgroup analysis of ever smokers and in adjusted models. Conclusions and Relevance: Defining airflow obstruction as FEV1:FVC less than 0.70 provided discrimination of COPD-related hospitalization and mortality that was not significantly different or was more accurate than other fixed thresholds and the LLN. These results support the use of FEV1:FVC less than 0.70 to identify individuals at risk of clinically significant COPD.",,,9,,,
1646,"A framework for transcriptome-wide association studies in breast cancer in diverse study populations BACKGROUND: The relationship between germline genetic variation and breast cancer survival is largely unknown, especially in understudied minority populations who often have poorer survival. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have interrogated breast cancer survival but often are underpowered due to subtype heterogeneity and clinical covariates and detect loci in non-coding regions that are difficult to interpret. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) show increased power in detecting functionally relevant loci by leveraging expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from external reference panels in relevant tissues. However, ancestry- or race-specific reference panels may be needed to draw correct inference in ancestrally diverse cohorts. Such panels for breast cancer are lacking. RESULTS: We provide a framework for TWAS for breast cancer in diverse populations, using data from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS), a population-based cohort that oversampled black women. We perform eQTL analysis for 406 breast cancer-related genes to train race-stratified predictive models of tumor expression from germline genotypes. Using these models, we impute expression in independent data from CBCS and TCGA, accounting for sampling variability in assessing performance. These models are not applicable across race, and their predictive performance varies across tumor subtype. Within CBCS (N_=_3,828), at a false discovery-adjusted significance of 0.10 and stratifying for race, we identify associations in black women near AURKA, CAPN13, PIK3CA, and SERPINB5 via TWAS that are underpowered in GWAS. CONCLUSIONS: We show that carefully implemented and thoroughly validated TWAS is an efficient approach for understanding the genetics underpinning breast cancer outcomes in diverse populations.",,,3,,,
1647,"Modeling drug- and chemical-induced hepatotoxicity with systems biology approaches We provide an overview of computational systems biology approaches as applied to the study of chemical- and drug-induced toxicity. The concept of ""toxicity pathways"" is described in the context of the 2007 US National Academies of Science report, ""Toxicity testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and A Strategy."" Pathway mapping and modeling based on network biology concepts are a key component of the vision laid out in this report for a more biologically based analysis of dose-response behavior and the safety of chemicals and drugs. We focus on toxicity of the liver (hepatotoxicity) - a complex phenotypic response with contributions from a number of different cell types and biological processes. We describe three case studies of complementary multi-scale computational modeling approaches to understand perturbation of toxicity pathways in the human liver as a result of exposure to environmental contaminants and specific drugs. One approach involves development of a spatial, multicellular ""virtual tissue"" model of the liver lobule that combines molecular circuits in individual hepatocytes with cell-cell interactions and blood-mediated transport of toxicants through hepatic sinusoids, to enable quantitative, mechanistic prediction of hepatic dose-response for activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor toxicity pathway. Simultaneously, methods are being developing to extract quantitative maps of intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulatory networks perturbed by environmental contaminants, using a combination of gene expression and genome-wide protein-DNA interaction data. A predictive physiological model (DILIsym_) to understand drug-induced liver injury (DILI), the most common adverse event leading to termination of clinical development programs and regulatory actions on drugs, is also described. The model initially focuses on reactive metabolite-induced DILI in response to administration of acetaminophen, and spans multiple biological scales.",,,1,,,
1648,"Flanking bases influence the nature of DNA distortion by platinum 1,2-intrastrand (GG) cross-links The differences in efficacy and molecular mechanisms of platinum anti-cancer drugs cisplatin (CP) and oxaliplatin (OX) are thought to be partially due to the differences in the DNA conformations of the CP and OX adducts that form on adjacent guanines on DNA, which in turn influence the binding of damage-recognition proteins that control downstream effects of the adducts. Here we report a comprehensive comparison of the structural distortion of DNA caused by CP and OX adducts in the TGGT sequence context using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. When compared to our previous studies in other sequence contexts, these structural studies help us understand the effect of the sequence context on the conformation of Pt-GG DNA adducts. We find that both the sequence context and the type of Pt-GG DNA adduct (CP vs. OX) play an important role in the conformation and the conformational dynamics of Pt-DNA adducts, possibly explaining their influence on the ability of many damage-recognition proteins to bind to Pt-DNA adducts.",,,7,,,
1649,"Assessing Challenges in Low-Income Families to Inform a Life Skills-Based Obesity Intervention BACKGROUND: This article describes the formative research undertaken to explore challenges of low-income parents of 3-to 5-year-olds to inform a parent-focused life skills-based intervention to prevent obesity in preschool-aged children. METHOD: A total of 40 parents completed surveys, 30 parents participated in focus groups, and 5 community stakeholders participated in individual interviews. In each data mode, participants were asked to prioritize a list of challenges centered on parenting, family care, and self-care. Survey data were analyzed descriptively using SAS, while focus groups and interviews were analyzed for emerging themes using ATLAS.ti. RESULTS: Parents reported needing strategies for managing children's behavior around picky eating, limits/boundaries, tantrums, and routines. Challenges with child behavior management were compounded by parents' inability to find affordable fun family activities outside the home and difficulties in communicating childrearing expectations to coparents/relatives who assisted with child care. Added to these were other competing priorities (e.g., financial) that led to the neglect of self, including the inability to find ""me"" time, build relationships, and care for one's health. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that address parenting, family care and self-care challenges of low-income parents may enhance resilience and support positive changes that can promote healthy development in children, including obesity prevention.",,,6,,,
1650,"The impact of HIV couple testing and counseling on social support among pregnant women and their partners in Lilongwe, Malawi: an observational study Couples HIV testing and counseling (couple counseling) promotes safer sexual behaviors, increases communication between couples, and decreases HIV transmission. However, the impact of couple counseling on social support, critical for persons living with HIV, has not been examined. Ninety couples with a recently tested HIV-positive pregnant woman (female-positive couples) and 47 couples with a recently tested HIV-negative pregnant woman (female-negative couples) were enrolled in an observational study at an antenatal clinic in Malawi. Each couple member was assessed immediately before and one month after couple counseling for partner, family, and peer social support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Before couple counseling, social support was lower among women than men in both female-positive couples (__=_-10.00, p_< _.01) and female-negative couples (__=_-8.43, p__< _.01). After couple counseling, social support increased for women in female-positive couples (__=_4.01, p_< _.01) and female-negative couples (__=_4.69, p_< _.01) but not for men in either type of couple. Couple counseling could be an effective strategy to increase social support for women, including those with recent HIV diagnoses.",,,2,,,
1651,"Association of rs780094 in GCKR with metabolic traits and incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease: the ARIC Study OBJECTIVE: The minor T-allele of rs780094 in the glucokinase regulator gene (GCKR) associates with a number of metabolic traits including higher triglyceride levels and improved glycemic regulation in study populations of mostly European ancestry. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we sought to replicate these findings, examine them in a large population-based sample of African American study participants, and to investigate independent associations with other metabolic traits in order to determine if variation in GKCR contributes to their observed clustering. In addition, we examined the association of rs780094 with incident diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke over up mean follow-up times of 8, 15, and 15 years, respectively. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Race-stratified analyses were conducted among 10,929 white and 3,960 black participants aged 45-64 at baseline assuming an additive genetic model and using linear and logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Previous findings replicated among white participants in multivariable adjusted models: the T-allele of rs780094 was associated with lower fasting glucose (p = 10(-7)) and insulin levels (p = 10(-6)), lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, p = 10(-9)), less prevalent diabetes (p = 10(-6)), and higher CRP (p = 10(-8)), 2-h postprandial glucose (OGTT, p = 10(-6)), and triglyceride levels (p = 10(-31)). Moreover, the T-allele was independently associated with higher HDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.022), metabolic syndrome prevalence (p = 0.043), and lower beta-cell function measured as HOMA-B (p = 0.011). Among black participants, the T-allele was associated only with higher triglyceride levels (p = 0.004) and lower insulin levels (p = 0.002) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.013). Prospectively, the T-allele was associated with reduced incidence of diabetes (p = 10(-4)) among white participants, but not with incidence of CHD or stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate rs780094 has independent associations with multiple metabolic traits as well as incident diabetes, but not incident CHD or stroke. The magnitude of association between the SNP and most traits was of lower magnitude among African American compared to white participants.",,,8,,,

To investigate the sexual risk profiles of gay app users and guide future HIV prevention programs, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 1,342 MSM in China examining associations between gay app use and sexual behaviors, including HIV and sexually transmitted disease testing. Compared to non-app users, app users were more likely to be younger, better educated, ""out"" about their sexual orientation, and single. They were also more likely to report multiple recent sex partners and HIV testing, but there was no difference in condomless sex between the two groups. Future research among MSM in LMIC is needed to characterize gay app use and explore its potential for future public health interventions.",,,6,,,
1653,"High adult sex ratios and risky sexual behaviors: a systematic review BACKGROUND: Thirty-four countries worldwide have abnormally high sex ratios (>102 men per 100 women), resulting in over 100 million missing women. Widespread sex selective abortion, neglect of young girls leading to premature mortality, and gendered migration have contributed to these persistent and increasing distortions. Abnormally high adult sex ratios in communities may drive sexually transmitted disease (STD) spread where women are missing and men cannot find stable partners. We systematically reviewed evidence on the association between high community sex ratios and individual sexual behaviors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Seven databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Sociological Abstracts, and PopLINE) were searched without restrictions on time or location. We followed PRISMA guidelines and evaluated quality according to STROBE criteria. 1093 citations were identified and six studies describing 57,054 individuals were included for review. All six studies showed an association between high community sex ratios and individual sexual risk behaviors. In high sex ratio communities, women were more likely to have multiple sex partners and men were more likely to delay first sexual intercourse and purchase sex. Only two studies included STD outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: High community sex ratios were associated with increased individual sexual risk behavior among both men and women. However, none of the studies examined unprotected sex or appropriately adjusted for gendered migration. Further studies are needed to understand the effect of community sex ratios on sexual health and to inform comprehensive STD control interventions.",,,3,,,
1654,"HIV and syphilis testing preferences among men who have sex with men in South China: a qualitative analysis to inform sexual health services BACKGROUND: Health services for men who have sex with men (MSM) are inadequate in many areas around the world. HIV and syphilis test uptake remain suboptimal among MSM in China and many other regions. To inform the development of more comprehensive sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing programs among MSM, we collected descriptive data on MSM testing practices and preferences. METHODS: MSM in two large urban Chinese cities were recruited through community-based organizations and clinics to participate in semi-structured interviews. We purposively sampled MSM across a range of sociodemographic characteristics and testing history, and assessed preferences for HIV and syphilis testing in the context of facilitators and barriers to testing and previous testing experiences. Each interview transcript was coded and thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti 7.0. RESULTS: 35 MSM were interviewed. Confidentiality and privacy were the most important factors influencing participants' decisions about whether and where to get tested. Men preferred rapid testing (results available within 30 minutes) compared to conventional tests where results take several hours or days to return. Participants described concerns about quality and accuracy of rapid tests offered in non-clinical settings such as community-based organizations. Men preferred testing service providers who were MSM-friendly, non-discriminatory, and medically trained. Preferred service center environments included: convenient but discrete location, MSM-friendly atmosphere, and clean/standard medical facilities. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the need for HIV/syphilis testing services that are confidential and inclusive of MSM. Rapid testing in decentralized (i.e. peripheral health facilities and community-level, non-clinical venues) settings provides an opportunity to reach individuals who have not been tested before, but must be accompanied by quality assurance systems and technical competence. Implementation research could further evaluate HIV/syphilis testing programs responsive to MSM preferences. SHORT SUMMARY: A qualitative study of MSM in South China found that men preferred rapid STD testing at MSM-focused test centers, but were concerned about test quality assurance and confidentiality.",,,6,,,
1655,"Transethnic insight into the genetics of glycaemic traits: fine-mapping results from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) consortium AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Elevated levels of fasting glucose and fasting insulin in non-diabetic individuals are markers of dysregulation of glucose metabolism and are strong risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies have discovered over 50 SNPs associated with these traits. Most of these loci were discovered in European populations and have not been tested in a well-powered multi-ethnic study. We hypothesised that a large, ancestrally diverse, fine-mapping genetic study of glycaemic traits would identify novel and population-specific associations that were previously undetectable by European-centric studies. METHODS: A multiethnic study of up to 26,760 unrelated individuals without diabetes, of predominantly Hispanic/Latino and African ancestries, were genotyped using the Metabochip. Transethnic meta-analysis of racial/ethnic-specific linear regression analyses were performed for fasting glucose and fasting insulin. We attempted to replicate 39 fasting glucose and 17 fasting insulin loci. Genetic fine-mapping was performed through sequential conditional analyses in 15 regions that included both the initially reported SNP association(s) and denser coverage of SNP markers. In addition, Metabochip-wide analyses were performed to discover novel fasting glucose and fasting insulin loci. The most significant SNP associations were further examined using bioinformatic functional annotation. RESULTS: Previously reported SNP associations were significantly replicated (p___0.05) in 31/39 fasting glucose loci and 14/17 fasting insulin loci. Eleven glycaemic trait loci were refined to a smaller list of potentially causal variants through transethnic meta-analysis. Stepwise conditional analysis identified two loci with independent secondary signals (G6PC2-rs477224 and GCK-rs2908290), which had not previously been reported. Population-specific conditional analyses identified an independent signal in G6PC2 tagged by the rare variant rs77719485 in African ancestry. Further Metabochip-wide analysis uncovered one novel fasting insulin locus at SLC17A2-rs75862513. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that while glycaemic trait loci often have generalisable effects across the studied populations, transethnic genetic studies help to prioritise likely functional SNPs, identify novel associations that may be population-specific and in turn have the potential to influence screening efforts or therapeutic discoveries. DATA AVAILABILITY: The summary statistics from each of the ancestry-specific and transethnic (combined ancestry) results can be found under the PAGE study on dbGaP here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356.v1.p1.",,,8,,,

1657,"The Future of Genomic Studies Must Be Globally Representative: Perspectives from PAGE The past decade has seen a technological revolution in human genetics that has empowered population-level investigations into genetic associations with phenotypes. Although these discoveries rely on genetic variation across individuals, association studies have overwhelmingly been performed in populations of European descent. In this review, we describe limitations faced by single-population studies and provide an overview of strategies to improve global representation in existing data sets and future human genomics research via diversity-focused, multiethnic studies. We highlight the successes of individual studies and meta-analysis consortia that have provided unique knowledge. Additionally, we outline the approach taken by the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study to develop best practices for performing genetic epidemiology in multiethnic contexts. Finally, we discuss how limiting investigations to single populations impairs findings in the clinical domain for both rare-variant identification and genetic risk prediction.",,,1,,,
1658,"Strategies for enriching variant coverage in candidate disease loci on a multiethnic genotyping array Investigating genetic architecture of complex traits in ancestrally diverse populations is imperative to understand the etiology of disease. However, the current paucity of genetic research in people of African and Latin American ancestry, Hispanic and indigenous peoples in the United States is likely to exacerbate existing health disparities for many common diseases. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology, Phase II (PAGE II), Study was initiated in 2013 by the National Human Genome Research Institute to expand our understanding of complex trait loci in ethnically diverse and well characterized study populations. To meet this goal, the Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA) was designed to substantially improve fine-mapping and functional discovery by increasing variant coverage across multiple ethnicities at known loci for metabolic, cardiovascular, renal, inflammatory, anthropometric, and a variety of lifestyle traits. Studying the frequency distribution of clinically relevant mutations, putative risk alleles, and known functional variants across multiple populations will provide important insight into the genetic architecture of complex diseases and facilitate the discovery of novel, sometimes population-specific, disease associations. DNA samples from 51,650 self-identified African ancestry (17,328), Hispanic/Latino (22,379), Asian/Pacific Islander (8,640), and American Indian (653) and an additional 2,650 participants of either South Asian or European ancestry, and other reference panels have been genotyped on MEGA by PAGE II. MEGA was designed as a new resource for studying ancestrally diverse populations. Here, we describe the methodology for selecting trait-specific content for use in multi-ethnic populations and how enriching MEGA for this content may contribute to deeper biological understanding of the genetic etiology of complex disease.",,,8,,,
1659,"A randomized trial exploring the effect of a telephone call follow-up on care plan compliance among older adults discharged home from the emergency department OBJECTIVES: Older patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) have difficulty comprehending discharge plans and are at high risk of adverse outcomes. The authors investigated whether a postdischarge telephone call-mediated intervention by a nurse would improve discharge care plan adherence, specifically by expediting post-ED visit physician follow-up appointments and/or compliance with medication changes. The second objectives were to determine if this telephone call intervention would reduce return ED visits and/or hospitalizations within 35_days of the index ED visit and to determine potential cost savings of this intervention. METHODS: This was a 10-week randomized, controlled trial among patients aged 65 and older discharged to home from an academic ED. At 1 to 3_days after each patient's index ED visit, a trained nurse called intervention group patients to review discharge instructions and assist with discharge plan compliance; placebo call group patients received a patient satisfaction survey call, while the control group patients were not called. Data collection calls occurred at 5 to 8_days and 30 to 35_days after the index ED visits for all three groups. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were performed for categorical data and the Kruskal-Wallis test examined group differences in time to follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients completed the study. Patients were 60% female and 72% white, with a mean age of 75_years (standard deviation [SD] _ 7.58_years). Intervention patients were more likely to follow up with medical providers within 5_days of their ED visits than either the placebo or the control group patients (54, 20, and 37%, respectively; p_=_0.04). All groups performed well in medication acquisition and comprehension of medication indications and dosage. There were no differences in return visits to the ED or hospital within 35_days of the index ED visit for intervention patients, compared to placebo or control group patients (22, 33, and 27%, respectively; p_=_0.41). An economic analysis showed an estimated 70% chance that this intervention would reduce total costs. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone call follow-up of older patients discharged from the ED resulted in expedited follow-up for patients with their primary care physicians. Further study is warranted to determine if these results translate into improved patient outcomes, decreased return ED visits or hospital admissions, and cost savings resulting from this intervention. _ 2014 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",,,6,,,
1660,"Genetic diversity is a predictor of mortality in humans BACKGROUND: It has been well-established, both by population genetics theory and direct observation in many organisms, that increased genetic diversity provides a survival advantage. However, given the limitations of both sample size and genome-wide metrics, this hypothesis has not been comprehensively tested in human populations. Moreover, the presence of numerous segregating small effect alleles that influence traits that directly impact health directly raises the question as to whether global measures of genomic variation are themselves associated with human health and disease. RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of 17 cohorts followed prospectively, with a combined sample size of 46,716 individuals, including a total of 15,234 deaths. We find a significant association between increased heterozygosity and survival (P = 0.03). We estimate that within a single population, every standard deviation of heterozygosity an individual has over the mean decreases that person's risk of death by 1.57%. CONCLUSIONS: This effect was consistent between European and African ancestry cohorts, men and women, and major causes of death (cancer and cardiovascular disease), demonstrating the broad positive impact of genomic diversity on human survival.",,,1,,,
1661,"Predictors of Longitudinal Trajectories of Alcohol Consumption in People with HIV BACKGROUND: Our aim was to describe alcohol consumption trajectories in a cohort of people living with HIV and determine clinical and sociodemographic predictors of each trajectory. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 7,906 patients in the 7 Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems sites. Alcohol consumption was categorized as none, moderate, and alcohol misuse. Predictors included age, race/ethnicity, depressive or anxiety symptoms, illicit drug use (opioids, methamphetamines, cocaine/crack), marijuana use, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HIV transmission risk factor, and HIV disease progression. We estimated sex-stratified alcohol consumption trajectories and their predictors. RESULTS: We found 7 trajectories of alcohol consumption in men: stable nondrinking and increased drinking (71% and 29% of initial nondrinking); stable moderate, reduced drinking, and increased alcohol misuse (59%, 21%, and 21% of initial moderate alcohol use); and stable alcohol misuse and reduced alcohol misuse (75% and 25% of initial alcohol misuse). Categories were similar in women, except lack of an increase to alcohol misuse trajectory among women that begin with moderate use. Older men and women were more likely to have stable nondrinking, while younger men were more likely to increase to or remain in alcohol misuse. Minorities, people with depressive or anxiety symptoms, HCV-infected individuals, and people who injected drugs were more likely to reduce use. Illicit drug use was associated with a reduction in overall drinking, while marijuana use was associated with stable moderate drinking or misuse. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal trajectories of increasing alcohol use and stable misuse highlight the need to integrate routine screening and alcohol misuse interventions into HIV primary care.

1662,"G protein coupled receptor kinase 3 regulates breast cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Chemokine receptor interactions are important modulators of breast cancer metastasis; however, it is now recognized that quantitative surface expression of one important chemokine receptor, CXCR4, may not directly correlate with metastasis and that its functional activity in breast cancer may better inform tumor pathogenicity. G protein coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) is a negative regulator of CXCR4 activity, and we show that GRK expression correlates with tumorigenicity, molecular subtype, and metastatic potential in human tumor microarray analysis. Using established human breast cancer cell lines and an immunocompetent in vivo mouse model, we further demonstrate that alterations in GRK3 expression levels in tumor cells directly affect migration and invasion in vitro and the establishment of distant metastasis in vivo. The effects of GRK3 modulation appear to be specific to chemokine-mediated migration behaviors without influencing tumor cell proliferation or survival. These data demonstrate that GRK3 dysregulation may play an important part in TNBC metastasis.",,,3,,,
1663,"Child safety and booster seat use in five tribal communities, 2010-2014 PROBLEM: Motor-vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) including AI/AN children. Child safety seats prevent injury and death among children in a motor-vehicle crash, yet use is low among AI/AN children. METHODS: To increase the use of child safety seats (CSS; car seats and booster seats), five tribal communities implemented evidence-based strategies from the Guide to Community Preventive Services during 2010-2014. Increased CSS use was evaluated through direct observational surveys and CSS event data. CSS events are used to check the installation, use, and safety of CSS and new CSS can be provided. RESULTS: CSS use increased in all five programs (ranging from 6% to 40%). Four out of five programs exceeded their goals for increased use. Among the five communities, a total of 91 CSS events occurred resulting in 1417 CSS checked or provided. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Evidence-based child passenger safety interventions are both feasible in and transferable to tribal communities. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,,1,,,

We aimed to identify other variants in SLC30A8 that increase diabetes risk and impair _-cell function, and test whether zinc intake modifies this risk. DESIGN/OUTCOME: We sequenced exons in SLC30A8 in 380 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) participants and identified 44 novel variants, which were genotyped in 3445 DPP participants and tested for association with diabetes incidence and measures of insulin secretion and processing. We examined individual common variants and used gene burden tests to test 39 rare variants in aggregate. RESULTS: We detected a near-nominal association between a rare-variant genotype risk score and diabetes risk. Five common variants were associated with the oral disposition index. Various methods aggregating rare variants demonstrated associations with changes in oral disposition index and insulinogenic index during year 1 of follow-up. We did not find a clear interaction of zinc intake with genotype on diabetes incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Individual common and an aggregate of rare genetic variation in SLC30A8 are associated with measures of _-cell function in the DPP. Exploring rare variation may complement ongoing efforts to uncover the genetic influences that underlie complex diseases.",,,1,,,
1665,"Prediction of HIV transmission cluster growth with statewide surveillance data BACKGROUND: Prediction of HIV transmission cluster growth may help guide public health action. We developed a predictive model for cluster growth in North Carolina (NC) using routine HIV surveillance data. METHODS: We identified putative transmission clusters with _2 members through pairwise genetic distances _1.5% from HIV-1 pol sequences sampled November 2010-December 2017 in NC. Clusters established by a baseline of January 2015 with any sequences sampled within 2 years before baseline were assessed for growth (new diagnoses) over 18 months. We developed a predictive model for cluster growth incorporating demographic, clinical, temporal, and contact tracing characteristics of baseline cluster members. We internally and temporally externally validated the final model in the periods January 2015-June 2016 and July 2016-December 2017. RESULTS: Cluster growth was predicted by larger baseline cluster size, shorter time between diagnosis and HIV care entry, younger age, shorter time since the most recent HIV diagnosis, higher proportion with no named contacts, and higher proportion with HIV viremia. The model showed areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of 0.82 and 0.83 in the internal and temporal external validation samples. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive model developed and validated here is a novel means of identifying HIV transmission clusters that may benefit from targeted HIV control resources.",,,6,,,
1666,"Repeat human immunodeficiency virus testing by transmission risk group and rurality of residence in north carolina BACKGROUND: Understanding of repeat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing (RHT) is limited and the impact of rural residence as a potential barrier to RHT is unknown. Rural populations are of particular interest in the Southeastern United States because of their disproportionate HIV burden. METHODS: We used HIV surveillance data from publicly funded HIV testing sites in North Carolina to assess repeat testing by transmission risk group and residential rurality in a retrospective cohort study. Linear binomial regression models were used to estimate adjusted, 1-year cumulative incidences and cumulative incidence differences comparing RHT within transmission risk populations by level of rurality. RESULTS: In our total study population of 600,613 persons, 19,275 (3.2%) and 9567 (1.6%) self-identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) and persons who inject drugs (PWID), respectively. A small minority, 13,723 (2.3%) resided in rural ZIP codes. Men who have sex with men were most likely to repeat test (unadjusted, 1-year cumulative incidence after an initial negative test, 16.4%) compared with PWID (13.2%) and persons who did not identify as either MSM or PWID (13.6%). The greatest effect of rurality was within PWID; the adjusted, 1-year cumulative incidence of RHT was 6.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-11.4) percentage points higher among metropolitan versus rural PWID. CONCLUSIONS: One-year cumulative incidence of RHT was low among all clients of publicly funded HIV testing sites in North Carolina, including MSM and PWID for whom annual testing is recommended. Our findings suggest a need for public health efforts to increase access to and support for RHT, particularly among rural PWID.",,,5,,,
1667,"Ethiopian women's perspectives on antenatal care and iron-folic acid supplementation: Insights for translating global antenatal calcium guidelines into practice After decades of global response to iron-deficiency anemia, lessons learned from antenatal iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation can inform new micronutrient supplementation efforts. The World Health Organization recommends calcium supplementation for the prevention of preeclampsia; however, little is documented on how to design programs to integrate calcium into the standard of care. Twenty interviews with pregnant women and 22 interviews with health providers and volunteers in two districts in Ethiopia were conducted to examine how barriers and facilitators to antenatal care, IFA supplementation, and initial reactions to calcium supplements and regimen might influence adherence and inform future programs. Women viewed supplementation positively but cited lack of information on benefits and risks, forgetfulness, and inconsistent IFA supply as challenges. Though knowledge and awareness of anemia and IFA supplements were widespread, preeclampsia was mostly unknown. Some symptoms of preeclampsia were viewed as normal in pregnancy, making it difficult to convey risk to motivate supplement use. Some women viewed co-consumption of IFA and calcium as potentially harmful and were confused regarding the simultaneous risks of anemia and hypertension, understood as ""low"" and ""high"" blood levels in pregnancy. However, most said they would take both IFA and calcium supplements if provided with supplements and counseling on purpose and benefits. Strategies such as social support from families, stronger community-based counseling, and increased health care provider and community awareness of preeclampsia are critical for women to understand the benefits of supplementation and resolve confusion caused by current descriptors used for anemia and hypertension. _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,6,,,
1668,"Middle managers' role in implementing evidence-based practices in healthcare: a systematic review BACKGROUND: Middle managers are in a unique position to promote the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in healthcare organizations, yet knowledge of middle managers' role in implementation and determinants (e.g., individual-, organizational-, and system-level factors) which influence their role remains fractured, spanning decades and disciplines. To synthesize understanding, we undertook a systematic review of studies of middle managers' role in healthcare EBP implementation and determinants of that role. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Business Source Complete (Ebsco) for literature on middle managers' role in healthcare EBP implementation and its determinants. We abstracted data from records that met inclusion criteria (i.e., written in English, peer-reviewed, and reporting either a protocol or results of an empirical study) into a matrix for analysis. We summarized categorical variables using descriptive statistics. To analyze qualitative data, we used a priori codes and then allowed additional themes to emerge. RESULTS: One hundred five records, spanning across several countries and healthcare settings and relating to a range of EBPs, met our inclusion criteria. Studies of middle managers' role in healthcare EBP implementation and its determinants substantially increased from 1996 to 2015. Results from included studies suggest that middle managers shape implementation climate in addition to fulfilling the four roles hypothesized in extant theory of middle managers' role in implementation. However, extant studies offered little understanding of determinants of middle managers' role. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that middle managers may play an important role in facilitating EBP implementation. Included studies offered little understanding regarding the relative importance of various roles, potential moderators of the relationship between middle managers' roles and EBP implementation, or determinants of middle managers' role in EBP implementation. Future studies should seek to understand determinants and moderators of middle managers' role. Clearer understanding may facilitate the translation of evidence into practice.",,,7,,,

1670,"Uncovering middle managers' role in healthcare innovation implementation BACKGROUND: Middle managers have received little attention in extant health services research, yet they may have a key role in healthcare innovation implementation. The gap between evidence of effective care and practice may be attributed in part to poor healthcare innovation implementation. Investigating middle managers' role in healthcare innovation implementation may reveal an opportunity for improvement. In this paper, we present a theory of middle managers' role in healthcare innovation implementation to fill the gap in the literature and to stimulate research that empirically examines middle managers' influence on innovation implementation in healthcare organizations. DISCUSSION: Extant healthcare innovation implementation research has primarily focused on the roles of physicians and top managers. Largely overlooked is the role of middle managers. We suggest that middle managers influence healthcare innovation implementation by diffusing information, synthesizing information, mediating between strategy and day-to-day activities, and selling innovation implementation. SUMMARY: Teamwork designs have become popular in healthcare organizations. Because middle managers oversee these team initiatives, their potential to influence innovation implementation has grown. Future research should investigate middle managers' role in healthcare innovation implementation. Findings may aid top managers in leveraging middle managers' influence to improve the effectiveness of healthcare innovation implementation.",,,7,,,
1671,"From strategy to action: how top managers' support increases middle managers' commitment to innovation implementation in health care organizations BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that top managers' support influences middle managers' commitment to innovation implementation. What remains unclear is how top managers' support influences middle managers' commitment. Results may be used to improve dismal rates of innovation implementation. METHODS: We used a mixed-method sequential design. We surveyed (n = 120) and interviewed (n = 16) middle managers implementing an innovation intended to reduce health disparities in 120 U.S. health centers to assess whether top managers' support directly influences middle managers' commitment; by allocating implementation policies and practices; or by moderating the influence of implementation policies and practices on middle managers' commitment. For quantitative analyses, multivariable regression assessed direct and moderated effects; a mediation model assessed mediating effects. We used template analysis to assess qualitative data. FINDINGS: We found support for each hypothesized relationship: Results suggest that top managers increase middle managers' commitment by directly conveying to middle managers that innovation implementation is an organizational priority (_ = 0.37, p = .09); allocating implementation policies and practices including performance reviews, human resources, training, and funding (bootstrapped estimate for performance reviews = 0.09; 95% confidence interval [0.03, 0.17]); and encouraging middle managers to leverage performance reviews and human resources to achieve innovation implementation. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Top managers can demonstrate their support directly by conveying to middle managers that an initiative is an organizational priority, allocating implementation policies and practices such as human resources and funding to facilitate innovation implementation, and convincing middle managers that innovation implementation is possible using available implementation policies and practices. Middle managers may maximize the influence of top managers' support on their commitment by communicating with top managers about what kind of support would be most effective in increasing their commitment to innovation implementation.",,,7,,,

If so, in what ways does their commitment influence implementation effectiveness? Although quantitative survey data analysis results suggest a weak relationship, qualitative interview data analysis results indicate that middle managers' commitment influences implementation effectiveness when middle managers are proactive.

1673,"Survivorship care plans: prevalence and barriers to use Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are intended to educate survivors and providers about survivors' transition from cancer treatment to follow-up care. Using a survey of 23 cancer programs in the South Atlantic United States, we (1) describe the prevalence and barriers to SCP use and (2) assess relationships between SCP use and (a) barriers and (b) cancer program characteristics. Most cancer programs (86 %) reported some SCP use; however, less than a quarter of cancer programs' providers had ever used an SCP. The majority (61 %) began using SCPs because of professional societies' recommendations. Key barriers to SCP use were insufficient organizational resources (75 %) and systems for SCP use. We found patterns in SCP use across location, program type, and professional society membership. Most cancer programs have adopted SCPs, but use remains inconsistent. Efforts to promote SCP use should address barriers, particularly in cancer programs that are susceptible to barriers to SCP use.",,,6,,,
1674,"Combined use of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF): a systematic review BACKGROUND: Over 60 implementation frameworks exist. Using multiple frameworks may help researchers to address multiple study purposes, levels, and degrees of theoretical heritage and operationalizability; however, using multiple frameworks may result in unnecessary complexity and redundancy if doing so does not address study needs. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) are both well-operationalized, multi-level implementation determinant frameworks derived from theory. As such, the rationale for using the frameworks in combination (i.e., CFIR_+__DF) is unclear. The objective of this systematic review was to elucidate the rationale for using CFIR_+__DF by (1) describing studies that have used CFIR_+__DF, (2) how they used CFIR_+__DF, and (2) their stated rationale for using CFIR_+__DF. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review to identify studies that mentioned both the CFIR and the TDF, were written in English, were peer-reviewed, and reported either a protocol or results of an empirical study in MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, or Google Scholar. We then abstracted data into a matrix and analyzed it qualitatively, identifying salient themes. FINDINGS: We identified five protocols and seven completed studies that used CFIR_+__DF. CFIR_+__DF was applied to studies in several countries, to a range of healthcare interventions, and at multiple intervention phases; used many designs, methods, and units of analysis; and assessed a variety of outcomes. Three studies indicated that using CFIR_+__DF addressed multiple study purposes. Six studies indicated that using CFIR_+__DF addressed multiple conceptual levels. Four studies did not explicitly state their rationale for using CFIR_+__DF. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the purposes that authors of the CFIR (e.g., comprehensive set of implementation determinants) and the TDF (e.g., intervention development) propose help to justify the use of CFIR_+__DF. Given that the CFIR and the TDF are both multi-level frameworks, the rationale that using CFIR_+__DF is needed to address multiple conceptual levels may reflect potentially misleading conventional wisdom. On the other hand, using CFIR_+__DF may more fully define the multi-level nature of implementation. To avoid concerns about unnecessary complexity and redundancy, scholars who use CFIR_+__DF and combinations of other frameworks should specify how the frameworks contribute to their study.

1675,"Criteria for selecting implementation science theories and frameworks: results from an international survey BACKGROUND: Theories provide a synthesizing architecture for implementation science. The underuse, superficial use, and misuse of theories pose a substantial scientific challenge for implementation science and may relate to challenges in selecting from the many theories in the field. Implementation scientists may benefit from guidance for selecting a theory for a specific study or project. Understanding how implementation scientists select theories will help inform efforts to develop such guidance. Our objective was to identify which theories implementation scientists use, how they use theories, and the criteria used to select theories. METHODS: We identified initial lists of uses and criteria for selecting implementation theories based on seminal articles and an iterative consensus process. We incorporated these lists into a self-administered survey for completion by self-identified implementation scientists. We recruited potential respondents at the 8th Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in Health and via several international email lists. We used frequencies and percentages to report results. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-three implementation scientists from 12 countries responded to the survey. They reported using more than 100 different theories spanning several disciplines. Respondents reported using theories primarily to identify implementation determinants, inform data collection, enhance conceptual clarity, and guide implementation planning. Of the 19 criteria presented in the survey, the criteria used by the most respondents to select theory included analytic level (58%), logical consistency/plausibility (56%), empirical support (53%), and description of a change process (54%). The criteria used by the fewest respondents included fecundity (10%), uniqueness (12%), and falsifiability (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation scientists use a large number of criteria to select theories, but there is little consensus on which are most important. Our results suggest that the selection of implementation theories is often haphazard or driven by convenience or prior exposure. Variation in approaches to selecting theory warn against prescriptive guidance for theory selection. Instead, implementation scientists may benefit from considering the criteria that we propose in this paper and using them to justify their theory selection. Future research should seek to refine the criteria for theory selection to promote more consistent and appropriate use of theory in implementation science.",,,7,,,
1676,"Potential determinants of health-care professionals' use of survivorship care plans: a qualitative study using the theoretical domains framework BACKGROUND: Survivorship care plans are intended to improve coordination of care for the nearly 14 million cancer survivors in the United States. Evidence suggests that survivorship care plans (SCPs) have positive outcomes for survivors, health-care professionals, and cancer programs, and several high-profile organizations now recommend SCP use. Nevertheless, SCP use remains limited among health-care professionals in United States cancer programs. Knowledge of barriers to SCP use is limited in part because extant studies have used anecdotal evidence to identify determinants. This study uses the theoretical domains framework to identify relevant constructs that are potential determinants of SCP use among United States health-care professionals. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews to assess the relevance of 12 theoretical domains in predicting SCP use among 13 health-care professionals in 7 cancer programs throughout the United States with diverse characteristics. Relevant theoretical domains were identified through thematic coding of interview transcripts, identification of specific beliefs within coded text units, and mapping of specific beliefs onto theoretical constructs. RESULTS: We found the following theoretical domains (based on specific beliefs) to be potential determinants of SCP use: health-care professionals' beliefs about the consequences of SCP use (benefit to survivors, health-care professionals, and the system as a whole); motivation and goals regarding SCP use (advocating SCP use; extent to which using SCPs competed for health-care professionals' time); environmental context and resources (whether SCPs were delivered at a dedicated visit and whether a system, information technology, and funding facilitated SCP use); and social influences (whether using SCPs is an organizational priority, influential people support SCP use, and people who could assist with SCP use buy into using SCPs). Specific beliefs mapped onto the following psychological constructs: outcome expectancies, intrinsic motivation, goal priority, resources, leadership, and team working. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have explored a limited range of determinants of SCP use. Our findings suggest a more comprehensive list of potential determinants that could be leveraged to promote SCP use. These results are particularly timely as cancer programs face impending SCP use requirements. Future work should develop instruments to measure the potential determinants and assess their relative influence on SCP use.",,,7,,,
1677,"Survivorship care plan implementation in US cancer programs: a national survey of cancer care providers Survivorship care plans (SCPs)-documents intended to improve care for cancer survivors who have completed active treatment-are required, yet implementation is poor. We sought to understand SCP implementation in cancer programs in the USA with the objective of identifying opportunities for improvement. We recruited cancer care providers in the USA via several cancer care networks to participate in a survey regarding SCP implementation. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. Three hundred ninety-five providers from diverse cancer programs in 47 states and Washington, DC responded to the survey. The timing of SCP implementation varied across and within cancer programs, with approximately 40% of respondents reporting developing SCPs more than 3_months after primary treatment or adjuvant therapy completion. Nurse navigators were responsible for 48-58% of each stage of SCP implementation. Processes that could have been automated often occurred in-person or via phone and vice versa. Respondents reported spending more than 2_h per SCP to complete all stages of implementation, of which less than a third was reimbursed by third-party payers. We identified several opportunities for improving SCP implementation, including broadening the base of responsibility, optimizing modes of communication, decreasing the time required and increasing the funding available, and limiting variation in SCP implementation across and within cancer programs. Future work should assess the influence of approaches to SCP implementation on desired outcomes.",,,7,,,
1678,"T-CaST: an implementation theory comparison and selection tool BACKGROUND: Theories, models, and frameworks (TMF) are foundational for generalizing implementation efforts and research findings. However, TMF and the criteria used to select them are not often described in published articles, perhaps due in part to the challenge of selecting from among the many TMF that exist in the field. The objective of this international study was to develop a user-friendly tool to help scientists and practitioners select appropriate TMF to guide their implementation projects. METHODS: Implementation scientists across the USA, the UK, and Canada identified and rated conceptually distinct categories of criteria in a concept mapping exercise. We then used the concept mapping results to develop a tool to help users select appropriate TMF for their projects. We assessed the tool's usefulness through expert consensus and cognitive and semi-structured interviews with implementation scientists. RESULTS: Thirty-seven implementation scientists (19 researchers and 18 practitioners) identified four criteria domains: usability, testability, applicability, and familiarity. We then developed a prototype of the tool that included a list of 25 criteria organized by domain, definitions of the criteria, and a case example illustrating an application of the tool. Results of cognitive and semi-structured interviews highlighted the need for the tool to (1) be as succinct as possible; (2) have separate versions to meet the unique needs of researchers versus practitioners; (3) include easily understood terms; (4) include an introduction that clearly describes the tool's purpose and benefits; (5) provide space for noting project information, comparing and scoring TMF, and accommodating contributions from multiple team members; and (6) include more case examples illustrating its application. Interview participants agreed that the tool (1) offered them a way to select from among candidate TMF, (2) helped them be explicit about the criteria that they used to select a TMF, and (3) enabled them to compare, select from among, and/or consider the usefulness of combining multiple TMF. These revisions resulted in the Theory Comparison and Selection Tool (T-CaST), a paper and web-enabled tool that includes 16 specific criteria that can be used to consider and justify the selection of TMF for a given project. Criteria are organized within four categories: applicability, usability, testability, and acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: T-CaST is a user-friendly tool to help scientists and practitioners select appropriate TMF to guide implementation projects. Additionally, T-CaST has the potential to promote transparent reporting of criteria used to select TMF within and beyond the field of implementation science.",,,7,,,
1679,"Survivorship care plans: are randomized controlled trials assessing outcomes that are relevant to stakeholders? PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes assessed in extant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to outcomes that stakeholders expect from survivorship care plans (SCPs). To facilitate the transition from active treatment to follow-up care for the 15.5 million US cancer survivors, many organizations require SCP use. However, results of several RCTs of SCPs' effectiveness have been null, possibly because they have evaluated outcomes on which SCPs should be expected to have limited influence. Stakeholders (e.g., survivors, oncologists) may expect outcomes that differ from RCTs' outcomes. METHODS: We identified RCTs' outcomes using a PubMed literature review. We identified outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs using semistructured interviews with stakeholders in three healthcare systems in the USA and Canada. Finally, we mapped RCTs' outcomes onto stakeholder-identified outcomes. RESULTS: RCT outcomes did not fully address outcomes that stakeholders expected from SCPs, and RCTs assessed outcomes that stakeholders did not expect from SCPs. RCTs often assessed outcomes only from survivors' perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: RCTs of SCPs' effectiveness have not assessed outcomes that stakeholders expect. To better understand SCPs' effectiveness, future RCTs should assess outcomes of SCP use that are relevant from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: SCPs' effectiveness may be optimized when used with an eye toward outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs. For survivors, this means using SCPs as a map to guide them with respect to what kind of follow-up care they should seek, when they should seek it, and from whom they should seek it.",,,6,,,
1680,"Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from the CHARGE consortium identifies common variants associated with carotid intima media thickness and plaque Carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and plaque determined by ultrasonography are established measures of subclinical atherosclerosis that each predicts future cardiovascular disease events. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data in 31,211 participants of European ancestry from nine large studies in the setting of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. We then sought additional evidence to support our findings among 11,273 individuals using data from seven additional studies. In the combined meta-analysis, we identified three genomic regions associated with common carotid intima media thickness and two different regions associated with the presence of carotid plaque (P < 5 _ 10(-8)). The associated SNPs mapped in or near genes related to cellular signaling, lipid metabolism and blood pressure homeostasis, and two of the regions were associated with coronary artery disease (P < 0.006) in the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis (CARDIoGRAM) consortium. Our findings may provide new insight into pathways leading to subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events.",,,8,,,
1681,"Drug-Gene Interactions of Antihypertensive Medications and Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Disease: A Pharmacogenomics Study from the CHARGE Consortium BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major risk factor for a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including myocardial infarction, sudden death, and stroke. In the US, over 65 million people have high blood pressure and a large proportion of these individuals are prescribed antihypertensive medications. Although large long-term clinical trials conducted in the last several decades have identified a number of effective antihypertensive treatments that reduce the risk of future clinical complications, responses to therapy and protection from cardiovascular events vary among individuals. METHODS: Using a genome-wide association study among 21,267 participants with pharmaceutically treated hypertension, we explored the hypothesis that genetic variants might influence or modify the effectiveness of common antihypertensive therapies on the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes. The classes of drug treatments included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. In the setting of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, each study performed array-based genome-wide genotyping, imputed to HapMap Phase II reference panels, and used additive genetic models in proportional hazards or logistic regression models to evaluate drug-gene interactions for each of four therapeutic drug classes. We used meta-analysis to combine study-specific interaction estimates for approximately 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a discovery analysis among 15,375 European Ancestry participants (3,527 CVD cases) with targeted follow-up in a case-only study of 1,751 European Ancestry GenHAT participants as well as among 4,141 African-Americans (1,267 CVD cases). RESULTS: Although drug-SNP interactions were biologically plausible, exposures and outcomes were well measured, and power was sufficient to detect modest interactions, we did not identify any statistically significant interactions from the four antihypertensive therapy meta-analyses (Pinteraction > 5.0_10-8). Similarly, findings were null for meta-analyses restricted to 66 SNPs with significant main effects on coronary artery disease or blood pressure from large published genome-wide association studies (Pinteraction _ 0.01). Our results suggest that there are no major pharmacogenetic influences of common SNPs on the relationship between blood pressure medications and the risk of incident CVD.",,,8,,,
1682,"Sequencing of 2 subclinical atherosclerosis candidate regions in 3669 individuals: Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium Targeted Sequencing Study BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis, the precursor to coronary heart disease and stroke, is characterized by an accumulation of fatty cells in the arterial intimal-medial layers. Common carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and plaque are subclinical atherosclerosis measures that predict cardiovascular disease events. Previously, genome-wide association studies demonstrated evidence for association with cIMT (SLC17A4) and plaque (PIK3CG). METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced 120 kb around SLC17A4 (6p22.2) and 251 kb around PIK3CG (7q22.3) among 3669 European ancestry participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) in Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. Primary analyses focused on 438 common variants (minor allele frequency _1%), which were independently meta-analyzed. A 3' untranslated region CCDC71L variant (rs2286149), upstream from PIK3CG, was the most significant finding in cIMT (P=0.00033) and plaque (P=0.0004) analyses. A SLC17A4 intronic variant was also associated with cIMT (P=0.008). Both were in low linkage disequilibrium with the genome-wide association study single nucleotide polymorphisms. Gene-based tests including T1 count and sequence kernel association test for rare variants (minor allele frequency < 1%) did not yield statistically significant associations. However, we observed nominal associations for rare variants in CCDC71L and SLC17A3 with cIMT and of the entire 7q22 region with plaque (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Common and rare variants in PIK3CG and SLC17A4 regions demonstrated modest association with subclinical atherosclerosis traits. Although not conclusive, these findings may help to understand the genetic architecture of regions previously implicated by genome-wide association studies and identify variants within these regions for further investigation in larger samples. _ 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,8,,,
1683,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD): single institutional experience of 141 patients BACKGROUND: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a well-recognized but rare complication of hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant. Due to rarity of this disease, retrospective studies from major transplant centers has been the main source to provide treatment guidelines, which are still in evolution. The sample size of this study is among one of the largest study on PTLD till date reported throughout the world. METHODS: This study was performed at University of Florida which is one of the largest transplant center in South East United States. We performed treatment and survival analysis along with univariate and multivariate analysis to identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: We reviewed 141 patients diagnosed with PTLD over last 22_years with median follow-up of 2.4_years. The estimated median overall survival of the entire group was 15.0_years. Sub group analysis showed that 5-year overall survival rates of pediatric population were 88% (median not reached). For adults, median OS was 5.35_years while for elderly patients it was 1.32_years. The estimated median OS of patients with monomorphic PTLD was 9.0_years while in polymorphic PTLD was 19.3_years. Univariate analysis identified gender, age at transplant and PTLD diagnosis, performance status, IPI score, allograft type, recipient EBV status, multiple acute rejections prior to PTLD diagnosis, PTLD sub-type, extra-nodal site involvement, immunosuppressive drug regimen at diagnosis, initial treatment best response were statistically significant prognostic factors (p_< _0.05). On multivariate analysis, age at PTLD diagnosis, recipient EBV status, bone marrow involvement, and initial best response were statistically significant prognostic factors (p_< _0.05). Surprisingly, use of Rituximab alone as upfront therapy had poor hazard ratio in the cumulative group as well less aggressive PTLD subgroup comprising of early lesions and polymorphic PTLD. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with treatment and analysis of outcomes does challenge current role of Rituximab use in treatment of PTLD. Currently as we define role of immunotherapy in cancer treatment, the role of acute rejections and immunosuppressant in PTLD becomes more relevant as noticed in our study. This study was also able to find new prognostic factors and also verified other known prognostic factors.",,,5,,,
1684,"Racial and health insurance disparities in pediatric acute kidney injury in the USA BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly increases morbidity and mortality for hospitalized children, yet sociodemographic risk factors for pediatric AKI are poorly described. We examined sociodemographic differences in pediatric AKI amongst a national cohort of hospitalized children. METHODS: Secondary analysis of the most recent (2012) Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Study sample weights were used to obtain national estimates of AKI (defined by administrative data). KID is a nationally representative sample of pediatric discharges throughout the USA. Linear risk regression models were used to assess the relationship between our primary exposures (race/ethnicity, health insurance, household urbanization, gender, and age) and the diagnosis of AKI, adjusting for comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 1,699,841 hospitalizations met our study criteria. In 2012, AKI occurred in approximately 12.3/1000 pediatric hospitalizations, which translates to almost 30,000 children nationally. Asian/Pacific Islander, African-American, and Hispanic children were at slightly increased risk for AKI compared to Caucasian children (adjusted risk difference (RD) 4.5 per 1000 hospitalizations, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-6.0; 2.5/1000 hospitalizations, 95% CI 1.7-3.3; and 1.7/1000 hospitalizations, 95% CI 0.9-2.5, respectively). Uninsured children were more likely to suffer AKI compared to children with any health insurance (e.g., no insurance versus Medicaid: adjusted RD 14.4/1000 hospitalizations, 95% CI 12.7-16.2). Based on these national estimates, one episode of AKI might be prevented if 70 (95% CI 62-79) hospitalized children without insurance were provided with Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric AKI occurs more frequently in racial minority and uninsured children, factors linked to lower socioeconomic status.",,,3,,,
1685,"Incidence and epidemiology of acute kidney injury in a pediatric Malawian trauma cohort: a prospective observational study BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is highly associated with mortality risk in children worldwide. Trauma can lead to AKI and is a leading cause of pediatric death in Africa. However, there is no information regarding the epidemiology of pediatric, trauma-associated AKI in Africa. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of pediatric trauma patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in Malawi. Participants enrolled at admission were followed prospectively throughout their hospitalization. AKI was defined by creatinine-only Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. We calculated descriptive statistics and univariate relative risks (RR) for hypothesis-generation of potential risk factors associated with AKI. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 114 participants. Depending on baseline creatinine definition, AKI incidence ranged from 4 to 10%. The new Schwartz equation estimated baseline creatinine values best and yielded an AKI incidence of 9.7%. Almost one in ten children died during hospitalization, but those with AKI (n_=_4) were at significantly higher risk of death compared to those without AKI (40.0% vs 6.2%; RR 6.5, 95% CI 2.2-19.1). Burn injuries were most commonly associated with AKI (63.6%). Other potential AKI risk factors included multiple injuries, trunk or facial injuries, and recent consumption of herbal remedies. CONCLUSIONS: AKI occurs in up to 10% of admitted pediatric trauma patients in Malawi and increases the risk of death 7-fold compared to those without AKI. This large unrecognized burden in trauma requires further investment by researchers, clinicians and policymakers to develop evidenced-based triage, recognition, and management approaches to prevent the associated sequelae and potential mortality from AKI.",,,3,,,
1686,"Insulin sensitivity and diabetic kidney disease in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes: an observational analysis of data from the TODAY clinical_trial BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease is a major cause of premature mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Worsening insulin sensitivity independent of glycemic control may contribute to the development of diabetic kidney disease. We investigated the longitudinal association of insulin sensitivity with hyperfiltration and increased albumin excretion in adolescents with T2DM. STUDY DESIGN: Observational prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 532 TODAY (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) participants aged 12 to 17 years with T2DM duration less than 2 years at baseline. The TODAY Study was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that examined the efficacy of 3 treatment regimens (metformin monotherapy, metformin plus rosiglitazone, or metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention program) to achieve durable glycemic control. PREDICTORS: Natural log-transformed estimated insulin sensitivity (reciprocal of fasting insulin), hemoglobin A1c concentration, age, race-ethnicity, treatment group, body mass index, loss of glycemic control, and hypertension. OUTCOMES: Hyperfiltration was defined as 99th percentile or higher of estimated glomerular filtration rate (_140mL/min/1.73m2) when referenced to healthy adolescents (NHANES 1999-2002) and albumin-creatinine ratio__ 30_g/mg at 3 consecutive annual visits. RESULTS: Hyperfiltration was observed in 7.0% of participants at baseline and in 13.3% by 5 years, with a cumulative incidence of 5.0% over 5 years. The prevalence of increased albumin excretion was 6% at baseline and 18% by 5 years, with a cumulative incidence of 13.4%. There was an 8% increase in risk for hyperfiltration per 10% lower estimated insulin sensitivity in unadjusted and adjusted models (P=0.01). Increased albumin excretion was associated with hemoglobin A1c concentration, but not estimated insulin sensitivity. LIMITATIONS: Longer follow-up is needed to capture the transition from hyperfiltration to rapid glomerular filtration rate decline in youth-onset T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Lower estimated insulin sensitivity was associated with risk for hyperfiltration over time, whereas increased albumin excretion was associated with hyperglycemia in youth-onset T2DM.

1687,"The other side of through: young breast cancer survivors' spectrum of sexual and reproductive health needs The long-term reproductive health impact of cancer treatments is a concern for premenopausal women with a history of breast cancer. This study examined the unmet sexual and reproductive health needs of breast cancer survivors, as well as concordances and discordances in needs by childbearing status and race. We interviewed 17 women diagnosed with breast cancer between the ages of 18 and 45 years and living in North Carolina. To analyze these data, we used the Sort and Sift, Think and Shift_ method, a multidimensional qualitative analysis approach. We learned that breast cancer survivors (a) received limited reproductive health information, (b) desired realistic expectations of conceiving postcancer, (c) struggled with adjusting to their altered physical appearance, and (d) had menopause symptoms that led to sexual health and quality of life issues. Breast cancer survivors are in need of and desire more education and resources to address their sexual and reproductive health concerns.",,,3,,,
1688,"Beyond incentives for involvement to compensation for consultants: increasing equity in CBPR approaches BACKGROUND: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) strives for equitable collaboration among community and academic partners throughout the research process. To build the capacity of academia to function as effective research partners with communities, the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (NC TraCS), home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)'s Clinical and Translational Sciences Award (CTSA), developed a community engagement consulting model. This new model harnesses the expertise of community partners with CBPR experience and compensates them equitably to provide technical assistance to community-academic research partnerships. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes approaches to valuing community expertise, the importance of equitable compensation for community partners, the impact on the community partners, opportunities for institutional change, and the constraints faced in model implementation. METHODS: Community Experts (CEs) are independent contractor consultants. CEs were interviewed to evaluate their satisfaction with their engagement and compensation for their work. LESSONS LEARNED: (1) CEs have knowledge, power, and credibility to push for systems change. (2) Changes were needed within the university to facilitate successful consultation to community-academic partnerships. (3) Sustaining the CE role requires staff support, continued compensation, increased opportunities for engagement, and careful consideration of position demands. (4) The role provides benefits beyond financial compensation. (5) Opportunities to gather deepened relationships within the partnership and built collective knowledge that strengthened the project. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging CE expertise and compensating them for their role benefits both university and community. Creating a place for community expertise within academia is an important step toward equitably including the community in research.",,,7,,,
1689,"Perceived barriers and preferred components for physical activity interventions in African-American survivors of breast or endometrial cancer with type 2 diabetes: the S.U.C.C.E.S.S. framework PURPOSE: African-American (AA) female cancer survivors share a disproportionate burden of diabetes compared to their white counterparts. Our objectives were to explore the perspectives of AA survivors with type 2 diabetes on perceived barriers to physical activity (PA) and preferences for a PA intervention and develop a framework for a PA program after cancer treatment. METHODS: Trained interviewers conducted semi-structured interviews with AA survivors of breast or endometrial cancer with diabetes (total n_=_20; 16 breast, 4 endometrial). Thirteen open-ended questions were posed to stimulate discussions, which were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two investigators independently reviewed transcriptions and extracted coded quotations to identify major themes. RESULTS: Median age of participants was 63_years. Nine themes were identified that focused on post-treatment physical symptoms (e.g., lymphedema, bone/joint pain, depression symptoms and self-motivation as barriers to PA, exercise routines tailored to physical limitations and peer partners and program leaders who understand their emotional health needs). The S.U.C.C.E.S.S. framework summarizes the survivors' preferences for an effective lifestyle intervention: Support efforts to maintain PA, Understand physical and depression symptoms, Collaborate with multi-disciplinary provider, Coordinate in-person intervention activities, Encourage partnerships among survivors for comorbidity risk reduction, develop Sustainable coping strategies for side effects of treatment, and Share local community resources. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors verbalized the need for a multi-disciplinary team to assist with their psychosocial needs and physical limitations to achieve their PA goals, as integrated into the S.U.C.C.E.S.S. FRAMEWORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The S.U.C.C.E.S.S. framework reflects the perspectives of survivors with type 2 diabetes and may help to inform post-treatment programs.",,,4,,,
1690,"'It's like you don't have a roadmap really': using an antiracism framework to analyze patients' encounters in the cancer system BACKGROUND: Cancer patients can experience healthcare system-related challenges during the course of their treatment. Yet, little is known about how these challenges might affect the quality and completion of cancer treatment for all patients, and particularly for patients of color. Accountability for Cancer Care through Undoing Racism and Equity is a multi-component, community-based participatory research intervention to reduce Black-White cancer care disparities. This formative work aimed to understand patients' cancer center experiences, explore racial differences in experiences, and inform systems-level interventions. METHODS: Twenty-seven breast and lung cancer patients at two cancer centers participated in focus groups, grouped by race and cancer type. Participants were asked about what they found empowering and disempowering regarding their cancer care experiences. The community-guided analysis used a racial equity approach to identify racial differences in care experiences. RESULTS: For Black and White patients, fear, uncertainty, and incomplete knowledge were disempowering; trust in providers and a sense of control were empowering. Although participants denied differential treatment due to race, analysis revealed implicit Black-White differences in care. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the challenges participants faced were related to lack of transparency, such that improvements in communication, particularly two-way communication could greatly improve patients' interaction with the system. Pathways for accountability can also be built into a system that allows patients to find solutions for their problems with the system itself. Participants' insights suggest the need for patient-centered, systems-level interventions to improve care experiences and reduce disparities.",,,5,,,
1691,"Prevalence of preterm, low birthweight, and small for gestational age delivery after breast cancer diagnosis: a population-based study BACKGROUND: Black-white disparities in breast cancer incidence rates and birth outcomes raise concerns about potential disparities in the reproductive health of premenopausal breast cancer survivors. We examined the prevalence of preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA) by breast cancer history and effect modification by race. METHODS: We analyzed linked North Carolina birth records and Central Cancer Registry files from 1990 to 2009 (n_=_2,325,229). We used multivariable negative log-binomial regression to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between breast cancer history and PTB, LBW, and SGA. RESULTS: Of 1,912,269 eligible births, 512 births were to mothers with a previous breast cancer diagnosis history. Average age at breast cancer diagnosis was 31.8_years (SD_=_4.7). Mean time from diagnosis to delivery was 3.3_years (SD_=_2.8). After multivariable adjustment, the PR was 1.67 (95% CI, 1.42-1.97) for PTB, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.23-1.84) for LBW, and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.05-1.61) for SGA comparing women with a breast cancer history to the general population. Among black mothers, the PRs associated with breast cancer history for PTB, LBW, and SGA were 1.31 (95% CI, 1.00-1.72), 1.49 (95% CI, 1.14-1.94), and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.11-1.87), respectively. The corresponding PRs among white mothers were 2.06 (95% CI, 1.67-2.54), 1.53 (95% CI, 1.12-2.08), and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.77-1.58), respectively. The interaction between breast cancer history and race was statistically significant for associations with PTB, but not for LBW or SGA. CONCLUSIONS: In our data, women with a breast cancer history were at higher risk of delivering a PTB, LBW, or SGA infant, especially if they received chemotherapy or gave birth within 2_years of their breast cancer diagnosis date.",,,3,,,
1692,"HLA-associated phenotypes in youth with autoimmune diabetes OBJECTIVES: To examine human leukocyte antigen HLA DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes within a multi-ethnic cohort and assess their association with characteristics of diabetes onset. METHODS: The sample included 1662 participants from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study who tested positive for GADA and/or IA-2A autoantibodies. Blood drawn at the study visit was used to measure fasting C-peptide (FCP) and genotype HLA DRB1 and DQB1 loci. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was determined from medical records. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models stratified by race/ethnicity were used to assess associations with DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes. RESULTS: The frequency of DRB1*03 susceptibility haplotypes ranged 27.5-28.9% in all racial/ethnic groups. The frequency of susceptibility DRB1*04-DQB1*0302 was higher in non-Hispanic White (NHW; 34.1%) and Hispanic (38.9%) compared to non-Hispanic Black (NHB; 20.8%) youth. Neutral and protective haplotypes were low frequency in all groups. DBR1*03 haplotypes were associated with younger age at diagnosis in NHW and positivity for multiple autoantibodies in Hispanics. DRB1*04-DQB1*0302 haplotypes were associated with multiple autoantibody positivity in NHW and Hispanics, and lower FCP and higher odds of DKA in Hispanics only. Although protective DRB1*04-DQB1*0301 haplotypes were associated with older age at diagnosis in NHW, they were also associated with multiple autoantibody positivity in these youth. Protective DRB1*13 haplotypes were associated with decreased odds of multiple autoantibody positivity in NHB youth. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and their association with onset-related characteristics of autoimmune diabetes varies across major racial/ethnic groups in the USA. This may contribute to variation in clinical presentation of autoimmune diabetes by race/ethnicity. _ 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",,,4,,,
1693,"Quantitative proteomic analysis of human airway cilia identifies previously uncharacterized proteins of high abundance Cilia are essential to many diverse cellular processes. Although many major axonemal components have been identified and studied, how they interact to form a functional axoneme is not completely understood. To further our understanding of the protein composition of human airway cilia, we performed a semiquantitative analysis of ciliary axonemes using label-free LC/MSE, which identified over 400 proteins with high confidence. Tubulins were the most abundant proteins identified, with evidence of 20 different isoforms obtained. Twelve different isoforms of axonemal dynein heavy chain were also identified. Absolute quantification of the nontubulin components demonstrated a greater than 75-fold range of protein abundance (RSPH9;1850 fmol vs CCDC103;24 fmol), adding another level of complexity to axonemal structure. Of the identified proteins, _70% are known axonemal proteins. In addition, many previously uncharacterized proteins were identified. Unexpectedly, several of these, including ERICH3, C1orf87, and CCDC181, were present at high relative abundance in the cilia. RT-PCR analysis and immunoblotting confirmed cilia-specific expression for eight uncharacterized proteins, and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated unique axonemal localizations. These studies have provided the first quantitative analysis of the ciliary proteome and have identified and characterized several previously unknown proteins as major constituents of human airway cilia.",,,1,,,
1694,"Characteristics of persons who inject drugs and who witness opioid overdoses in Vietnam: a cross-sectional analysis to inform future overdose prevention programs BACKGROUND: Persons who use opioids have a high risk of overdose and associated mortality. In Vietnam, little is known about the characteristics of this population and the persons who are witness to those overdoses. One approach to combatting fatal overdose has been the use of peer interventions in which a friend or injecting partner administers overdose reversal medication, but availability in Vietnam of these medications is limited to pilot programs with aims to expand in the future (Le Minh and V.F. Go, Personal Communication, 2016). The primary objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics associated with witnessing three or more overdoses in a lifetime. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data from a four-arm randomized control trial conducted in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam, known as the Prevention for Positives project. One thousand six hundred seventy-three PWID were included in the analysis. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with witnessing three or more overdoses in a lifetime. Characteristics explored included education, employment, marital status, risky drug use behaviors, locations for accessing syringes, recent overdose, history of incarceration, drug treatment, and having slept outside in the past 3_months. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent (n_=_1203) of participants had witnessed at least one overdose in their lifetime, and 46% had witnessed three or more overdoses (n_=_765). In the multivariable model, having less than secondary education (AOR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57, 0.86), having slept outside in the past 3_months (AOR 1.77; 95% CI 1.31, 2.40), having a history of incarceration (AOR 1.33; 95% CI 1.07, 1.65), having a history of drug treatment (AOR 1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.77), experiencing a recent non-fatal overdose (AOR 3.84; 95% CI 2.36, 6.25), injecting drugs daily (AOR 1.79; 95% CI 1.45, 2.20), receptive needle sharing (AOR 1.30; 95% CI 1.04, 1.63), and number of years injecting (AOR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02, 1.07) were significantly associated with witnessing three or more overdoses. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted interventions are needed to train persons witnessing an overdose to administer overdose-reversal medication. This includes targeting persons prior to release from prisons, drug treatment centers, and those accessing syringe exchange programs. Additional research should assess the burden of witnessing an overdose as well as locations for medication distribution. Assessments of the training capacity and needs for implementing these programs among drug using peers in Vietnam are of the utmost importance.",,,3,,,
1695,"Racial differences in weight loss mediated by engagement and behavior change Objective: We set out to determine if a primarily Internet-delivered behavioral weight loss intervention produced differential weight loss in African American and non-Hispanic White women, and to identify possible mediators. Design: Data for this analysis were from a randomized controlled trial, collected at baseline and 4-months. Setting: The intervention included monthly face-to-face group sessions and an Internet component that participants were recommended to use at least once weekly. Participants: We included overweight or obese African American and non-Hispanic White women (n=170), with at least weekly Internet access, who were able to attend group sessions. Intervention: Monthly face-to-face group sessions were delivered in large or small groups. The Internet component included automated tailored feedback, self-monitoring tools, written lessons, video resources, problem solving, exercise action planning tools, and social support through message boards. Main Outcome Measure: Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate race group differences in weight change. Results: Non-Hispanic White women lost more weight than African American women (-5.03% vs.-2.39%, P=.0002). Greater website log-ins and higher change in Eating Behavior Inventory score in non-Hispanic White women partially mediated the race-weight loss relationship. Conclusions: The weight loss disparity may be addressed through improved website engagement and adoption of weight control behaviors.",,,3,,,
1696,"Comparative effectiveness of a standard behavioral and physical activity enhanced behavioral weight loss intervention in Black women Black women typically lose small amounts of weight in behavioral weight loss interventions, partially due to low engagement in physical activity. Culturally relevant enhancement of the physical activity component may improve weight loss. This study compared the effectiveness of a culturally-relevant, physical activity-enhanced behavioral weight loss intervention to a standard behavioral weight loss intervention in Black women (n = 85) over 6 months. The study was conducted in two cohorts from March 2016 to February 2017 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Participants had an average age of 48.30 _ 11.02 years with an average body mass index of 36.46 _ 4.50 kg/m2. Standard and enhanced groups' weight change (-2.83 kg and -2.08 kg, respectively) and change in physical activity (43.93 min/ week and 15.29 min/week, respectively) did not differ between groups. Significantly more standard group participants lost 5% of baseline weight compared to enhanced group participants. This study produced typical weight loss results in Black women. Behavioral weight loss treatment remains moderately effective for Black women. Strategies to increase attendance and self-monitoring, and the inclusion of cultural contexts to weight-related behaviors are needed to improve outcomes.",,,9,,,
1697,"Perceptions of Community HIV/STI Risk Among U.S Women Living in Areas with High Poverty and HIV Prevalence Rates Although studies have consistently demonstrated that women at high risk for HIV and non-HIV sexually transmitted infections (STIs) tend to underestimate their individual risk, little is known about how women at risk perceive their community's HIV/STI risk. We explored perceptions of community HIV/STI risk among U.S. women living in areas with high poverty and HIV prevalence rates as part of a qualitative substudy of the Women's HIV SeroIncidence Study. Semi-structured focus groups were conducted. Data were coded and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Participants expressed the perception that their communities were at elevated HIV/STI risk, mostly due to contextual and structural factors such as lack of access to health care and education. Findings suggest that HIV prevention messages that target U.S. women at high risk for HIV may be strengthened by addressing the high perceived community HIV/STI risk driven by structural factors.",,,6,,,
1698,"Medication risk communication during rheumatology office visits OBJECTIVE: We used a multidimensional framework to describe the types of information about medication risks that rheumatologists provide to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients during routine office visits. METHODS: We analyzed 1,094 audiotaped rheumatology office visits involving 450 RA patients. Each patient had up to 3 visits audiotaped. In conjunction with each office visit, patients also completed a self-administered questionnaire and interview and the rheumatologists provided ratings of patient health status. RESULTS: The number of medication risks discussed per visit ranged from 0-18, with a mean _ SD of 3.23 _ 2.93. The rheumatologist initiated _80% of the medication risk discussions. Approximately one-fourth of the discussions (25.6%) were limited to an assessment of whether or not the patient was experiencing a medication side effect. More risks were discussed during visits when changes to the patient's regimen were discussed than when no changes were discussed (X= 3.93, SD = 3.10 and X = 2.20, SD = 2.34, respectively; P < 0.0001). When medications were being proposed for addition to the patient's regimen, the most frequently discussed risk dimensions were the importance of monitoring (30%), probability (29.8%), things the patient should do to minimize risk (25.5%), and risk severity (21.8%). CONCLUSION: Most discussions of medication risks that we observed were quite limited and often restricted to an assessment of whether the patient was experiencing side effects from their current medications. The amount of information that is optimal and how to tailor information to the preferences and abilities of individual patients remain important areas for future research.

1699,"Polymorphisms in the carcinogen detoxification genes CYB5A and CYB5R3 and breast cancer risk in African American women PURPOSE: Cytochrome b 5 (encoded by CYB5A) and NADH cytochrome b 5 reductase (encoded by CYB5R3) detoxify aromatic and heterocyclic amine mammary carcinogens found in cigarette smoke. We hypothesized that CYB5A and CYB5R3 polymorphisms would be associated with breast cancer risk in women. METHODS: We characterized the prevalence of 18 CYB5A and CYB5R3 variants in genomic DNA from African American (AfrAm) and Caucasian (Cauc) women from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study population (1,946 cases and 1,747 controls) and determined their associations with breast cancer risk, with effect modification by smoking. RESULTS: A CYB5R3 variant, I1M+6T (rs8190370), was significantly more common in breast cancer cases (MAF 0.0238) compared with controls (0.0169, p = 0.039); this was attributable to a higher MAF in AfrAm cases (0.0611) compared with AfrAm controls (0.0441, p = 0.046; adjusted OR 1.41, CI 0.98-2.04; p = 0.062). When smoking was considered, I1M+6T was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk in AfrAm smokers (adjusted OR 2.10, 1.08-4.07; p = 0.028) compared with never smokers (OR = 1.21; 0.77-1.88; p for interaction = 0.176). I1M+6T and three additional CYB5R3 variants, -251T, I8-1676C, and *392C, as well as two CYB5A variants, 13G and I2-992T, were significantly more common in AfrAms compared with Caucs. CONCLUSIONS: CYB5R3 I1M+6C>T should be considered in future molecular epidemiologic studies of breast cancer risk in AfrAms. Further, variants in CYB5A and CYB5R3 should be considered in the evaluation of other tumors in AfrAms that are associated with aromatic and heterocyclic amine exposures, to include prostate, bladder, and colon cancers.",,,3,,,
1700,"A cross-sectional study of medical students' knowledge of patient safety and quality improvement BACKGROUND: The Association of American Medical Colleges and the World Health Organization have endorsed formal patient safety and quality improvement (QI) education for medical students. We surveyed medical students to assess their current level of patient safety and QI knowledge and to identify factors associated with increased knowledge. METHODS: A literature review, focus groups with medical students, and local expert interviews were used to develop an electronic survey, which was distributed to all medical students at a single medical school in the spring of 2012. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the medical school student body (N = 790) participated in the survey. A greater proportion of students reported previous exposure to patient safety education than to QI education (79% vs 47%). Students scored an average of 56% and 58% on the patient safety and QI knowledge tests, respectively. Having or pursuing an advanced degree (P = .02) and previous exposure to patient safety education (P = .02) were associated with higher knowledge scores. After adjusting for confounding variables, only previous exposure to QI education (P = .02) was associated with higher QI knowledge scores. LIMITATIONS: There is a risk of measurement bias due to the use of an unvalidated instrument. Students who have greater knowledge of patient safety or QI might recall exposure at a greater frequency, inflating the association between exposure and knowledge. Also, this is a cross-sectional study, so we cannot draw conclusions about causality. CONCLUSION: Medical students' knowledge of patient safety and QI is low. Previous formal or informal education about these topics is associated with increased knowledge.",,,1,,,
1701,"Quality of care for heart failure patients hospitalized for any cause OBJECTIVES: The study sought to assess the quality of care for heart failure patients who are hospitalized for all causes. BACKGROUND: Performance measures for heart failure target patients with a principal diagnosis of heart failure. However, patients with heart failure are commonly hospitalized for other causes and may benefit from treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. METHODS: We assessed rates of compliance with care measures for patients hospitalized with acute or chronic heart failure in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) study surveillance catchment area from 2005 to 2009. Rates of compliance were compared between patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure and those with another principal discharge diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 4,345 hospitalizations of heart failure patients, 39.6% carried a principal diagnosis of heart failure. Patients with a principal heart failure diagnosis had higher rates of LV function assessment (89.1% vs. 82.5%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.10) and discharge ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in LV dysfunction (64.1% vs. 56.3%; aPR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.20) as compared to patients hospitalized for another cause. LV assessment and ACE inhibitor/ARB use were associated with reductions in 1-year post-discharge mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.85; adjusted odds ratio: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.96, respectively) that did not differ for patients with versus without a principal heart failure diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with individuals hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of heart failure, heart failure patients hospitalized for other causes were less likely to receive guideline recommended care. Quality initiatives may improve care by targeting hospitalizations with either principal or secondary heart failure diagnoses. Copyright _ 2014 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

1702,"High-normal albuminuria and risk of heart failure in the community BACKGROUND: Albuminuria has been associated with cardiovascular risk, but the relationship of high-normal albuminuria to subsequent heart failure has not been well established. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 10,975 individuals free from heart failure were followed up from the fourth ARIC Study visit (1996-1998) through January 2006. PREDICTOR: Urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), analyzed continuously and categorically as optimal (< 5 mg/g), intermediate-normal (5-9 mg/g), high-normal (10-29 mg/g), microalbuminuria (30-299 mg/g), and macroalbuminuria (_300 mg/g). OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Incident heart failure was defined as a heart failure-related hospitalization or death. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the HR of heart failure after adjustment for age, race, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and other cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Individuals were followed up for a median of 8.3 years and experienced 344 heart failure events. Compared with normal UACR, albuminuria was associated with a progressively increased risk of heart failure from intermediate-normal (adjusted HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12-2.11) and high-normal UACR (adjusted HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.38-2.66) to microalbuminuria (adjusted HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.77-3.50) and macroalbuminuria (adjusted HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.10-5.72). Results were similar in secondary analyses of participants censored at the time of coronary heart disease event and along a range of eGFRs. LIMITATIONS: UACR was measured as a single random sample. CONCLUSIONS: Albuminuria is associated with subsequent heart failure, even in individuals with few cardiovascular risk factors and UACR within the normal range. Our results suggest that the association between albuminuria and heart failure may not be mediated fully by ischemic heart disease or kidney disease, measured using eGFR.

1703,"Outcomes after management of young women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 with a 6-month observation protocol OBJECTIVE: Recommendations regarding treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 in women have evolved over the years: young women with CIN 2 may be offered observation with Pap smears and colposcopy every 6 months instead of immediate excision or ablation of disease. The purpose of this study was to observe patient follow-up during the initiation of this management protocol for young women with CIN 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of clinical outcomes of women younger than 30 years with CIN 2 on index biopsy and planned follow-up at UNC between July 2009 and August 2010. A chart review for clinical variables, follow-up visits, and progression of disease was conducted. Primary analysis determined the rate of follow-up and pathology at 6 months. Secondary analysis investigated risk factors for incomplete follow-up. RESULTS: Seventy women met inclusion criteria; 46 were managed with observation. Twenty-eight (60.8%; 28/46) women completed a follow-up visit. Demographic and clinical variables did not reach statistical significance in predicting the likelihood of completion of a follow-up visit, although there was a trend toward greater follow-up in employed patients (odds ratio = 5.25, 95% confidence interval = 0.84-34.78). Approximately half (52.4%; 11/21) of women with a completed cervical biopsy demonstrated regression of disease during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these data, follow-up in this population was unpredictable based on basic demographic or clinical factors that we often use to judge likelihood of compliance with medical recommendations. The percentage of patients with regression at follow-up was as expected from the natural history of CIN 2.",,,6,,,
1704,"High school physical activity and nutrition policy: summarizing changes over time using latent class analysis INTRODUCTION: High school physical activity and nutrition policies can substantially affect student behavior and outcomes. Although public health officials and legislators have advocated for policy improvements, the extent to which policies have changed at local levels is not well understood. This study identifies latent classes of physical activity and nutrition policy environments and explores changes in prevalence of these classes from 2000 to 2016. METHODS: Data from the School Health Policies and Practices Study, a repeated cross-sectional survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered at the school district level in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2016, were analyzed in 2018. Using latent class analysis, policy environment subgroups were identified, described, and then dichotomized based on satisfaction in meeting recommendations. Associations of latent classes with year and urbanicity were evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Five latent classes were identified each for physical activity and nutrition policy environments, all with distinct characteristics. Physical activity policies improved from 2000 to 2006 (p< 0.001) and then plateaued until 2016, whereas nutrition policies improved consistently from 2000 to 2016 (p< 0.001, p=0.011, p< 0.001). Though significant disparities between urban and rural school districts were found, these disparities narrowed during the studied years, particularly for physical activity policies. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated proportion of school districts with satisfactory physical activity and nutrition policy environments increased from 2000 to 2016, possibly because of legislative and policy advocacy efforts. However, many areas for improvement remain. Unsatisfactory latent classes that remained prevalent though 2016 may highlight policy domains that should be targeted by future interventions or subject to further research.

1705,"Return to work in low-income Latina and non-Latina white breast cancer survivors: a 3-year longitudinal study BACKGROUND: Previous research has found an 80% return-to-work rate in mid-income white breast cancer survivors, but little is known about the employment trajectory of low-income minorities or whites. We set out to compare the trajectories of low-income Latina and non-Latina white survivors and to identify correlates of employment status. METHODS: Participants were low-income women who had localized breast cancer, spoke English or Spanish, and were employed at the time of diagnosis. Interviews were conducted 6, 18, and 36 months after diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of employment status at 18 months. RESULTS: Of 290 participants, 62% were Latina. Latinas were less likely than non-Latina whites to be working 6 months (27% vs 49%; P = .0002) and 18 months (45% vs 59%; P = .02) after diagnosis, but at 36 months there was no significant difference (53% vs 59%; P = .29). Latinas were more likely to be manual laborers than were non-Latina whites (P < .0001). Baseline job type and receipt of axillary node dissection were associated with employment status among Latinas but not non-Latina whites. CONCLUSIONS: Neither low-income Latinas nor non-Latina whites approached the 80% rate of return to work seen in wealthier white populations. Latinas followed a protracted return-to-work trajectory compared to non-Latina whites, and differences in job type appear to have played an important role. Manual laborers may be disproportionately impacted by surgical procedures that limit physical activity. This can inform the development of rehabilitative interventions and may have important implications for the surgical and postsurgical management of patients.

1706,"Reframing the conversation about contralateral prophylactic mastectomy: Preparing women for postsurgical realities OBJECTIVE: Women with unilateral, early-stage breast cancer and low genetic risk are increasingly opting for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM), a concerning trend because CPM offers few clinical benefits while increasing risks of surgical complications. Few qualitative studies have analyzed factors motivating this irreversible decision. Using qualitative methods, this study sought to understand women's decision making and the impact of CPM on self-confidence, sense of femininity, sexual intimacy, and peace of mind. METHODS: Women who had CPM within the last 10_years were recruited to participate in the study. We conducted a thematic analysis of the data. RESULTS: Forty-five women were interviewed. When making the decision for CPM, most had incomplete knowledge of potential negative outcomes. However, all believed CPM had more benefits than harms and would confer the most peace of mind and the fewest regrets should cancer return. They knew their contralateral breast cancer risk was low but were not persuaded by statistics. They wanted to do everything possible to reduce their risk of another breast cancer, even by a minimal amount, but most reported paying an unexpectedly high price for this small reduction in risk. Nevertheless, 41 of 45 reported that they would make the same decision again. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight an opportunity for physicians to reframe the conversation to focus on the patient experience of the tradeoffs of CPM rather than statistical odds of future cancers. Our findings suggest that more data may not dissuade women from CPM but may better prepare them for its outcomes. _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,3,,,
1707,"Religious freedom restoration acts and sexual minority population health in the United States Religious freedom restoration acts (RFRAs) in the United States potentially facilitate discrimination against lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (i.e., sexual minorities). In the current investigation, we explored whether a population health metric among sexual minority adults changed over time based on the presence, absence, or introduction of a state RFRA. Data are from 21 of the United States that gathered sexual orientation data from population-based samples of noninstitutionalized adults in the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (CDC, 2015, 2016). The analytic sample included 4,911 sexual minority individuals. Time was measured in 4 3-month quarters (i.e., Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). For each state, the prevalence of sexual minority adults reporting _14 unhealthy days/30 days was calculated. Only Indiana (the only state in the sample that passed an RFRA in 2015) exhibited significant increasing proportions over time of sexual minority adults reporting _14 unhealthy days (Q1 = 24.5%, Q2 = 34.8%, Q3 = 41.2%, Q4 = 59.5%; _ = 0.50, SE = 0.23, p = .037). Post hoc analyses revealed that unhealthy days did not increase for heterosexual adults in Indiana. Indiana's RFRA could have contributed to the increasing prevalence of unhealthy days among sexual minority adults in that state during 2015. Public health surveillance tools are needed to expedite analyses of the impact of laws on minority population health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",,,5,,,
1708,"Health Care Use, Health Behaviors, and Medical Conditions Among Individuals in Same-Sex and Opposite-Sex Partnerships: A Cross-Sectional Observational Analysis of the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS), 2003-2011 BACKGROUND: Prior research documents disparities between sexual minority and nonsexual minority individuals regarding health behaviors and health services utilization. However, little is known regarding differences in the prevalence of medical conditions. OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between sexual minority status and medical conditions. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted multiple logistic regression analyses of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2003-2011). We identified individuals who reported being partnered with an individual of the same sex, and constructed a matched cohort of individuals in opposite-sex partnerships. SUBJECTS: A total of 494 individuals in same-sex partnerships and 494 individuals in opposite-sex partnerships. MEASURES: Measures of health risk (eg, smoking status), health services utilization (eg, physician office visits), and presence of 15 medical conditions (eg, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, HIV, alcohol disorders). RESULTS: Same-sex partnered men had nearly 4 times the odds of reporting a mood disorder than did opposite-sex partnered men [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=3.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.85-8.48]. Compared with opposite-sex partnered women, same-sex partnered women had greater odds of heart disease (aOR=2.59; 95% CI, 1.19-5.62), diabetes (aOR=2.75; 95% CI, 1.10-6.90), obesity (aOR=1.92; 95% CI, 1.26-2.94), high cholesterol (aOR=1.89; 95% CI, 1.03-3.50), and asthma (aOR=1.90; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19). Even after adjusting for sociodemographics, health risk behaviors, and health conditions, individuals in same-sex partnerships had 67% increased odds of past-year emergency department utilization and 51% greater odds of _3 physician visits in the last year compared with opposite-sex partnered individuals. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of individual-level, provider-level, and system-level approaches are needed to reduce disparities in medical conditions and health care utilization among sexual minority individuals.",,,3,,,
1709,"Particulate matter and albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, and incident CKD BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exposure to particulate matter (PM) < 2.5 _m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) has been linked to detrimental health effects. This study aimed to describe the relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and kidney disease, including eGFR, level of albuminuria, and incident CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The study included 10,997 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort who were followed from 1996-1998 through 2016. Monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations (_g/m3) were estimated at geocoded participant addresses using geographic information system-based, spatiotemporal generalized additive mixed models-including geospatial covariates such as land use-and then averaged over the 12-month period preceding participant examination. Covariate-adjusted, cross-sectional associations of PM2.5, baseline eGFR, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were estimated using linear regression. PM2.5 and incident CKD (defined as follow-up eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with _25% eGFR decline relative to baseline, CKD-related hospitalization or death based on International Classification of Diseases 9/10 codes, or development of ESKD) associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Modeling was stratified by study site, and stratum-specific estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Baseline mean participant age was 63 (_6) years and eGFR was 86 (_16) ml/min per 1.73 m2. There was no significant PM2.5-eGFR association at baseline. Each 1-_g/m3 higher annual average PM2.5 was associated with higher UACR after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and clinical covariates (percentage difference, 6.6%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.6% to 10.7%). Each 1-_g/m3 higher annual average PM2.5 was associated with a significantly higher risk of incident CKD (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to higher annual average PM2.5 concentrations was associated with a higher level of albuminuria and higher risk for incident CKD in a community-based cohort.

1710,"Evidence-based criteria in the nutritional context During the last decade, approaches to evidence-based medicine, with its heavy reliance on the randomized clinical trial (RCT), have been adapted to nutrition science and policy. However, there are distinct differences between the evidence that can be obtained for the testing of drugs using RCTs and those needed for the development of nutrient requirements or dietary guidelines. Although RCTs present one approach toward understanding the efficacy of nutrient interventions, the innate complexities of nutrient actions and interactions cannot always be adequately addressed through any single research design. Because of the limitations inherent in RCTs, particularly of nutrients, it is suggested that nutrient policy decisions will have to be made using the totality of the available evidence. This may mean action at a level of certainty that is different from what would be needed in the evaluation of drug efficacy. Similarly, it is judged that the level of confidence needed in defining nutrient requirements or dietary recommendations to prevent disease can be different from that needed to make recommendations to treat disease. In brief, advancing evidence-based nutrition will depend upon research approaches that include RCTs but go beyond them. Also necessary to this advance is the assessing, in future human studies, of covariates such as biomarkers of exposure and response, and the archiving of samples for future evaluation by emerging technologies.",,,1,,,
1711,"Contribution of dietary supplements to nutritional adequacy in race/ethnic population subgroups in the united states The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that nutritional deficiencies in the U.S. population vary by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and could be as high as nearly one third of certain population groups. Based on nationally representative data in 10,698 adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) primarily from 2009-2012, assessments were made of race/ethnic differences in the impact of dietary supplements on nutrient intake and prevalence of inadequacies. Compared to food alone, use of any dietary supplement plus food was associated with significantly higher intakes of 14 to 16 of 19 nutrients examined in all race/ethnic groups; and significantly (p < 0.01) reduced rates of inadequacy for 8/17 nutrients examined in non-Hispanic whites, but only 3-4/17 nutrients (calcium, and vitamins A, D, and E) for other race/ethnic groups. Across race/ethnic groups an increased prevalence of intakes above the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) was seen for 1-9/13 nutrients, but all were less than 5% of the population. In conclusion, use of dietary supplements is associated with increased micronutrient intake, decreased nutrient inadequacies, and slight increases in prevalence above the UL in all race/ethnicities examined, with greater benefits among non-Hispanic whites.",,,4,,,

1713,"The modifying effects of social support on psychological outcomes in patients with heart failure OBJECTIVE: We examined the modifying effects of social support on depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients receiving coping skills training (CST). METHOD: We considered the modifying effects of social support in the Coping Effectively with Heart Failure clinical trial, which randomized 179 heart failure (HF) patients to either 4 months of CST or usual care enhanced by HF education (HFE). CST involved training in specific coping techniques, whereas HFE involved education about HF self-management. Social support was assessed by the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) Social Support Inventory, QoL was assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). RESULTS: Linear regression models revealed a significant Intervention Group _ Baseline Social Support interaction for change in KCCQ total scores (p = .006) and BDI-II scores (p < .001). Participants with low social support assigned to the CST intervention showed large improvements in KCCQ scores (M = 11.2, 95% CI [5.7, 16.8]), whereas low-social-support patients assigned to the HFE controls showed no significant change (M = -0.8, 95% CI [-7.2, 5.6]). Similarly, BDI-II scores in participants with low social support in the CST group showed large reductions (M = -8.7, 95% CI [-11.3, -6.1]) compared with low-social-support HFE participants (M = -3.0, 95% CI [-6.0, -0.1]). CONCLUSIONS: HF patients with low social support benefit substantially from telephone-based CST interventions. Targeting HF patients with low social support for behavioral interventions could prove to be a cost-effective strategy for improving QoL and reducing depression.

1714,"Measuring exclusive breastfeeding social support: Scale development and validation in Uganda The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for 6_months and continued breastfeeding for at least 2_years. Social support has been widely recognized to influence breastfeeding practices. However, existing scales do not measure exclusive breastfeeding social support (EBFSS), rather they assess social support for any breastfeeding. Further, they are tailored towards high-income settings. Therefore, our objectives were to develop and validate a tool to measure EBFSS in low-income settings. To develop the scale, local and international breastfeeding experts were consulted on modifications to the Hughes' Breastfeeding Social Support Scale. It was then implemented in an observational cohort in Gulu, Uganda, at 1 (n_=_238) and 3 (n_=_237) months post-partum (NCT02925429). We performed polychoric and polyserial correlations to remove redundant items and exploratory factor analysis at 1_month post-partum to determine the latent factor structure of EBFSS. We further applied confirmatory factor analysis to assess dimensionality of the scale at 3_months post-partum. We then conducted tests of predictive, convergent, and discriminant validity against EBF, self-efficacy, general social support, and depression. The modification of the Hughes' scale resulted in 18 items, which were reduced to 16 after examining variances and factor loadings. Three dimensions of support emerged: Instrumental, Emotional, and Informational, with alpha coefficients of 0.79, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. Predictive, convergent, and discriminant validity of the resultant EBFSS scale was supported. The EBFSS scale is valid and reliable for measuring EBFSS in northern Uganda and may be of use in other low-income settings to assess determinants of EBF. _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,2,,,
1715,"Medicare's hospice benefit: analysis of utilization and resource use OBJECTIVE: This work provides descriptive statistics on hospice users. It also explores the magnitude of relative resource use during hospice episodes and whether such patterns vary by episode length for patients who only use routine home care as compared to those who use multiple levels of hospice care. Examining resource use for hospice users who require different hospice levels of care within an episode versus solely routine home care provides insight to the varied resource use associated with the different patient populations (i.e., those who may require steady routine home care across the entire episode versus those who require varied levels of care across the episode). DATA SOURCE: The analyses were based on a longitudinal analytic file that was constructed from 100% of Medicare claims for hospice users with completed episodes spanning September 1, 2008 through the end of calendar year 2011. In examining resource use for routine home care users and all levels of hospice care, the analyses were restricted to single episode decedents who began their hospice episode on or after April 1, 2010 and whose date of death was on or before December 31, 2011. Daily wage-weighted visit units (WWVUs) were calculated for each patient during their hospice stay. In order to compute a WWVU, one-fourth of the Bureau of Labor Statistics hourly wage rate for each visit discipline (i.e., skilled nursing, medical social services, home health aide, and an average for therapies) was multiplied by the corresponding number of visit units reported on hospice claims. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using enhanced data on the intensity of service use, the results confirm previous research that suggested a curved pattern to service use during a hospice episode. For several measures of resource intensity, service use is more intensive during the initial days in the episode and for the last few days prior to death relative to the middle days of the episode. The pattern becomes more pronounced as episodes increase in length, but is otherwise a similar curve when compared by diagnosis. Thus, the results provide useful information for potential policy discussions about Medicare hospice reform.",,,6,,,
1716,"CUBN is a gene locus for albuminuria Identification of genetic risk factors for albuminuria may alter strategies for early prevention of CKD progression, particularly among patients with diabetes. Little is known about the influence of common genetic variants on albuminuria in both general and diabetic populations. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 63,153 individuals of European ancestry with genotype information from genome-wide association studies (CKDGen Consortium) and from a large candidate gene study (CARe Consortium) to identify susceptibility loci for the quantitative trait urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and the clinical diagnosis microalbuminuria. We identified an association between a missense variant (I2984V) in the CUBN gene, which encodes cubilin, and both UACR (P = 1.1 _ 10(-11)) and microalbuminuria (P = 0.001). We observed similar associations among 6981 African Americans in the CARe Consortium. The associations between this variant and both UACR and microalbuminuria were significant in individuals of European ancestry regardless of diabetes status. Finally, this variant associated with a 41% increased risk for the development of persistent microalbuminuria during 20 years of follow-up among 1304 participants with type 1 diabetes in the prospective DCCT/EDIC Study. In summary, we identified a missense CUBN variant that associates with levels of albuminuria in both the general population and in individuals with diabetes.",,,8,,,
1717,"NFAT5 and SLC4A10 Loci Associate with Plasma Osmolality Disorders of water balance, an excess or deficit of total body water relative to body electrolyte content, are common and ascertained by plasma hypo- or hypernatremia, respectively. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study meta-analysis on plasma sodium concentration in 45,889 individuals of European descent (stage 1 discovery) and 17,637 additional individuals of European descent (stage 2 replication), and a transethnic meta-analysis of replicated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 79,506 individuals (63,526 individuals of European descent, 8765 individuals of Asian Indian descent, and 7215 individuals of African descent). In stage 1, we identified eight loci associated with plasma sodium concentration at P< 5.0 _ 10-6 Of these, rs9980 at NFAT5 replicated in stage 2 meta-analysis (P=3.1 _ 10-5), with combined stages 1 and 2 genome-wide significance of P=5.6 _ 10-10 Transethnic meta-analysis further supported the association at rs9980 (P=5.9 _ 10-12). Additionally, rs16846053 at SLC4A10 showed nominally, but not genome-wide, significant association in combined stages 1 and 2 meta-analysis (P=6.7 _ 10-8). NFAT5 encodes a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that coordinates the intracellular response to hypertonic stress but was not previously implicated in the regulation of systemic water balance. SLC4A10 encodes a sodium bicarbonate transporter with a brain-restricted expression pattern, and variant rs16846053 affects a putative intronic NFAT5 DNA binding motif. The lead variants for NFAT5 and SLC4A10 are cis expression quantitative trait loci in tissues of the central nervous system and relevant to transcriptional regulation. Thus, genetic variation in NFAT5 and SLC4A10 expression and function in the central nervous system may affect the regulation of systemic water balance.

1718,"Regional Evaluation of the Severity-Based Stroke Triage Algorithm for Emergency Medical Services Using Discrete Event Simulation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Severity-Based Stroke Triage Algorithm for Emergency Medical Services endorses routing patients with suspected large vessel occlusion acute ischemic strokes directly to endovascular stroke centers (ESCs). We sought to evaluate different specifications of this algorithm within a region. METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation environment to model patients with suspected stroke transported according to algorithm specifications, which varied by stroke severity screen and permissible additional transport time for routing patients to ESCs. We simulated King County, Washington, and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, distributing patients geographically into census tracts. Transport time to the nearest hospital and ESC was estimated using traffic-based travel times. We assessed undertriage, overtriage, transport time, and the number-needed-to-route, defined as the number of patients enduring additional transport to route one large vessel occlusion patient to an ESC. RESULTS: Undertriage was higher and overtriage was lower in King County compared with Mecklenburg County for each specification. Overtriage variation was primarily driven by screen (eg, 13%-55% in Mecklenburg County and 10%-40% in King County). Transportation time specifications beyond 20 minutes increased overtriage and decreased undertriage in King County but not Mecklenburg County. A low- versus high-specificity screen routed 3.7_ more patients to ESCs. Emergency medical services spent nearly twice the time routing patients to ESCs in King County compared with Mecklenburg County. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate how discrete event simulation can facilitate informed decision making to optimize emergency medical services stroke severity-based triage algorithms. This is the first step toward developing a mature simulation to predict patient outcomes. _ 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,9,,,
1719,"The Case for Drone-assisted Emergency Response to Cardiac Arrest: An Optimized Statewide Deployment Approach BACKGROUND Despite evidence linking rapid defibrillation to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival, bystander use of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) remains low, due in part to AED placement and accessibility. AED-equipped drones may improve time-to-defibrillation, yet the benefits and costs are unknown.METHODS We designed drone deployment networks for the state of North Carolina using mathematical optimization models to select drone stations from existing infrastructure by specifying the number of stations and the targeted AED arrival time. Expected outcomes were evaluated over the drone's lifespan (4 years). We estimated the following parameters: proportion of OHCAs within a targeted AED delivery time, bystander utilization of AEDs, survival/neurological status, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).RESULTS Statewide, 16,503 adults aged 18 or older were expected to experience OHCA with an attempted resuscitation over 4 years. Compared to no drone network, all proposed drone networks were expected to improve survival outcomes. For example, assuming 46% of OHCAs have bystanders willing to use an AED, a 500-drone network decreased the median time of defibrillator arrival from 7.7 to 2.7 minutes compared to no drone network. Expected survival rates doubled (24.5% versus 12.3%), resulting in an additional 30,267 QALYs ($858/incremental QALY). If just 4.5% of OHCAs had willing bystanders, 13.8% of victims would have survived. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that an AED drone network remained cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions.CONCLUSIONS With proper integration into existing systems, large-scale networks for drone AED delivery have the potential to substantially improve OHCA survival rates while remaining cost-effective. Public health researchers should consider advocating for feasibility studies and policy development surrounding drones. _2019 by the North Carolina Institute of Medicine and The Duke Endowment.

1720,"Vital exhaustion and sudden cardiac death in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study OBJECTIVE: Vital exhaustion (VE), a construct defined as lack of energy, increased fatigue and irritability, and feelings of demoralisation, has been associated with cardiovascular events. We sought to examine the relation between VE and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS: The ARIC Study is a predominately biracial cohort of men and women, aged 45-64 at baseline, initiated in 1987 through random sampling in four US communities. VE was measured using the Maastricht questionnaire between 1990 and 1992 among 13_923 individuals. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the hazard of out-of-hospital SCD across tertiles of VE scores. RESULTS: Through 2012, 457 SCD cases, defined as a sudden pulseless condition presumed due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a previously stable individual, were identified in ARIC by physician record review. Adjusting for age, sex and race/centre, participants in the highest VE tertile had an increased risk of SCD (HR 1.48, 95%__I 1.17 to 1.87), but these findings did not remain significant after adjustment for established cardiovascular disease risk factors (HR 0.94, 95%__I 0.73 to 1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Among participants of the ARIC study, VE was not associated with an increased risk for SCD after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. _ Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

1721,"Gender differences in the incidence and prevalence of patellofemoral pain syndrome The purpose of this investigation was to determine the association between gender and the prevalence and incidence of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). One thousand five hundred and twenty-five participants from the United States Naval Academy (USNA) were followed for up to 2.5 years for the development of PFPS. Physicians and certified athletic trainers documented the cases of PFPS. PFPS was defined as retropatellar pain during at least two of the following activities: ascending/descending stairs, hopping/jogging, prolonged sitting, kneeling, and squatting, negative findings on examination of knee ligament, menisci, bursa, and synovial plica, and pain on palpation of either the patellar facets or femoral condyles. Poisson and logistic regressions were performed to determine the association between gender and the incidence and prevalence of PFPS, respectively. The incidence rate for PFPS was 22/1000 person-years. Females were 2.23 times (95% CI: 1.19, 4.20) more likely to develop PFPS compared with males. While not statistically significant, the prevalence of PFPS at study enrollment tended to be higher in females (15%) than in males (12%) (P=0.09). Females at the USNA are significantly more likely to develop PFPS than males. Additionally, at the time of admission to the academy, the prevalence of PFPS was not significantly different between genders._ 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",,,9,,,
1722,"A double-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine provides incomplete protection in mice and induces increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important emerging virus that is highly pathogenic in aged populations and is maintained with great diversity in zoonotic reservoirs. While a variety of vaccine platforms have shown efficacy in young-animal models and against homologous viral strains, vaccine efficacy has not been thoroughly evaluated using highly pathogenic variants that replicate the acute end stage lung disease phenotypes seen during the human epidemic. Using an adjuvanted and an unadjuvanted double-inactivated SARS-CoV (DIV) vaccine, we demonstrate an eosinophilic immunopathology in aged mice comparable to that seen in mice immunized with the SARS nucleocapsid protein, and poor protection against a nonlethal heterologous challenge. In young and 1-year-old animals, we demonstrate that adjuvanted DIV vaccine provides protection against lethal disease in young animals following homologous and heterologous challenge, although enhanced immune pathology and eosinophilia are evident following heterologous challenge. In the absence of alum, DIV vaccine performed poorly in young animals challenged with lethal homologous or heterologous strains. In contrast, DIV vaccines (both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted) performed poorly in aged-animal models. Importantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication. These data raise significant concerns regarding DIV vaccine safety and highlight the need for additional studies of the molecular mechanisms governing DIV-induced eosinophilia and vaccine failure, especially in the more vulnerable aged-animal models of human disease.",,,8,,,
1723,"SARS-CoV and emergent coronaviruses: viral determinants of interspecies transmission Most new emerging viruses are derived from strains circulating in zoonotic reservoirs. Coronaviruses, which had an established potential for cross-species transmission within domesticated animals, suddenly became relevant with the unexpected emergence of the highly pathogenic human SARS-CoV strain from zoonotic reservoirs in 2002. SARS-CoV infected approximately 8000 people worldwide before public health measures halted the epidemic. Supported by robust time-ordered sequence variation, structural biology, well-characterized patient pools, and biological data, the emergence of SARS-CoV represents one of the best-studied natural models of viral disease emergence from zoonotic sources. This review article summarizes previous and more recent advances into the molecular and structural characteristics, with particular emphasis on host__eceptor interactions, that drove this remarkable virus disease outbreak in human populations.",,,1,,,
1724,"Heterogeneity of genomic evolution and mutational profiles in multiple myeloma Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with a complex and incompletely understood molecular pathogenesis. Here we use whole-exome sequencing, copy-number profiling and cytogenetics to analyse 84 myeloma samples. Most cases have a complex subclonal structure and show clusters of subclonal variants, including subclonal driver mutations. Serial sampling reveals diverse patterns of clonal evolution, including linear evolution, differential clonal response and branching evolution. Diverse processes contribute to the mutational repertoire, including kataegis and somatic hypermutation, and their relative contribution changes over time. We find heterogeneity of mutational spectrum across samples, with few recurrent genes. We identify new candidate genes, including truncations of SP140, LTB, ROBO1 and clustered missense mutations in EGR1. The myeloma genome is heterogeneous across the cohort, and exhibits diversity in clonal admixture and in dynamics of evolution, which may impact prognostic stratification, therapeutic approaches and assessment of disease response to treatment.",,,8,,,
1725,"Developmental windows of susceptibility to inorganic arsenic: a survey of current toxicologic and epidemiologic data Globally, millions of people are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) via drinking water. Exposure to iAs is associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes, including cancers, skin lesions, neurological impairment, cardiovascular diseases, and an increased susceptibility to infection. Among those exposed to iAs, the developing fetus and young children represent particularly sensitive subpopulations. Specifically, it has been noted in animal models and human populations that prenatal and early life iAs exposures are associated with diseases occurring during childhood and later in life. Recent epidemiologic and toxicologic studies have also demonstrated that epigenetic alterations may play a key mechanistic role underlying many of the iAs-associated health outcomes, including the carcinogenic and immunologic effects of exposure. This review summarizes some of the key studies related to prenatal and early life iAs exposure and highlights the complexities in isolating the precise developmental windows of exposure associated with these health outcomes.",,,8,,,
1726,"The role of DNA methylation in gene regulation Abstract The addition of a methyl group to a DNA base is known as DNA methylation. Typically, this occurs at the location of a cytosine proximal to a guanine base and is catalyzed by enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases. Importantly, DNA methylation is related to the regulation of gene expression, and it plays a critical role in development, with functions in X-chromosome inactivation, genetic imprinting, and the repression of transposable elements. DNA methylation is often thought to have a repressive effect on gene expression. However, the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression is location-specific. Several mechanisms are posited to underlie these observations, including proteins that mediate a link between DNA methylation and the underlying chromatin structure. The relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression has important implications for understanding and identifying disease processes.",,,7,,,

The link between prenatal exposures and latent health outcomes suggests that these exposures may result in long-term epigenetic reprogramming. Toxic metals and endocrine disruptors are two major classes of contaminants that are ubiquitously present in the environment and represent threats to human health. In this review, we present evidence that prenatal exposures to these contaminants result in fetal epigenomic changes, including altered global DNA methylation, gene-specific CpG methylation and microRNA expression. Importantly, these changes may have functional cellular consequences, impacting health outcomes later in life. Therefore, these epigenetic changes represent a critical mechanism that warrants further study.",,,2,,,
1728,"Fetal-sex dependent genomic responses in the circulating lymphocytes of arsenic-exposed pregnant women in New Hampshire Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) during pregnancy is associated with adverse health outcomes present both at birth and later in life. A biological mechanism may include epigenetic and genomic alterations in fetal genes involved in immune functioning. To investigate the role of the maternal immune response to in utero iAs exposure, we conducted an analysis of the expression of immune-related genes in pregnant women from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. A set of 31 genes was identified with altered expression in association with levels of urinary total arsenic, urinary iAs, urinary monomethylated arsenic and urinary dimethylated arsenic. Notably, maternal gene expression signatures differed when stratified on fetal sex, with a more robust inflammatory response observed in male pregnancies. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes were also related to birth outcomes. These findings highlight the sex-dependent nature of the maternal iAs-induced inflammatory response in relationship to fetal outcomes. Copyright _ 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,6,,,
1729,"One-carbon metabolism nutrient intake and the association between body mass index and urinary arsenic metabolites in adults in the Chihuahua cohort BACKGROUND: Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) via drinking water is a serious global health threat. Various factors influence susceptibility to iAs-associated health outcomes, including differences in iAs metabolism. Previous studies have shown that obesity is associated with iAs metabolism. It has been hypothesized that this association can be explained by confounding from nutritional factors involved in one-carbon metabolism, such as folate or other B vitamins, whose intake may differ across BMI categories and is known be associated with iAs metabolism. However, no studies have explored whether this association is confounded by nutritional factors. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the distribution of urinary arsenic species in a cross-sectional cohort of 1166 adults living in Chihuahua, Mexico from 2008 to 2013. Nutrient intake related to one-carbon metabolism, including folate, vitamin B2, and vitamin B12, was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire developed for Mexican populations. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the association between BMI and the distribution of urinary arsenic metabolites. Effect modification by drinking water iAs level and sex was also examined. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, educational attainment, smoking, alcohol consumption, seafood consumption, water iAs, and sex, BMI was negatively associated with the proportion of urinary inorganic arsenic (%U-iAs) and urinary monomethylated arsenic (%U-MMAs) and positively associated with urinary dimethylated arsenic (%U-DMAs). This relationship was not influenced by additional adjustment for folate, vitamin B2, or vitamin B12 intake. Additionally, there was significant effect modification by both drinking water iAs level and sex. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence for an association between BMI and arsenic metabolism. However, contrary to previous hypotheses, these results suggest that this association is not confounded by the intake of micronutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism. Copyright _ 2018.

1730,"Improving physical activity in daycare interventions BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to objectively determine whether the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) program improved physical activity levels during the school day. METHODS: The study compared the physical activity levels of subjects from 26 daycare centers, randomized into treatment (N=13) and control (N=13) groups. The subjects were 3 to 5 year olds (N=209, 104 males and 105 females; age [years]=3.85_0.8 [mean_standard deviation]), and accelerometry was used to determine the subjects' physical activity levels. Accelerometers were attached to each subject for 2 days before and immediately after a 6-month intervention. Height, mass, and waist were also measured. RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated that the treatment group demonstrated significant increases in moderate and vigorous physical activity, as compared to the control group (F(1, 207)=6.3, p< 0.05, Cohen's d=0.30; F(1, 207)=4.7, p< 0.05, Cohen's d=0.25, respectively). The treatment group also showed significant increases in total physical activity (F(1, 218)=12.4; p< 0.05) from pre- to post-test with significant increases in moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity (F(1, 218)=18.6, p< 0.05; F(1, 218)=23.3, p< 0.05, respectively). Regression analyses revealed significant increases in height for both groups from pre- to post-tests, but no differences were noted between groups.

The nuanced associations between GBV, alcohol misuse, and HIV must be explored and protective factors identified. This study examines the associations between physical and sexual GBV and HIV infection and explores how alcohol misuse and sexual agency may mediate the GBV-HIV association. Method: Participants were 361 Black African women (Mean age_=_28.39, SD_=_7.92) who reported using alcohol and/or drugs weekly in the past 3 months, engaging in condomless sex, and having a boyfriend. Women were recruited from disadvantaged communities in Pretoria, South Africa. Individuals who met the eligibility criteria and enrolled in the study consented and completed a computer-assisted personal interview assessing GBV, alcohol misuse, and sexual agency and underwent HIV testing (i.e., blood test). Results: The indirect effect of physical assault on HIV status at enrollment through alcohol misuse was significant (log odds = 0.23, SE = 0.12, 95% CI [0.0151, 0.4998]). Conclusions: HIV prevention efforts focusing on reducing alcohol misuse may be more effective, which might reduce the HIV burden among this group of vulnerable South African women.",,,6,,,
1732,"Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies A preventive HIV-1 vaccine should induce HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). However, bnAbs generally require high levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) to acquire breadth, and current vaccine strategies have not been successful in inducing bnAbs. Because bnAbs directed against a glycosylated site adjacent to the third variable loop (V3) of the HIV-1 envelope protein require limited SHM, the V3-glycan epitope is an attractive vaccine target. By studying the cooperation among multiple V3-glycan B cell lineages and their coevolution with autologous virus throughout 5 years of infection, we identify key events in the ontogeny of a V3-glycan bnAb. Two autologous neutralizing antibody lineages selected for virus escape mutations and consequently allowed initiation and affinity maturation of a V3-glycan bnAb lineage. The nucleotide substitution required to initiate the bnAb lineage occurred at a low-probability site for activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity. Cooperation of B cell lineages and an improbable mutation critical for bnAb activity defined the necessary events leading to breadth in this V3-glycan bnAb lineage. These findings may, in part, explain why initiation of V3-glycan bnAbs is rare, and suggest an immunization strategy for inducing similar V3-glycan bnAbs.

1733,"Effect of primary care intervention on breastfeeding duration and intensity OBJECTIVES: We determined the effectiveness of primary care-based, and pre- and postnatal interventions to increase breastfeeding. METHODS: We conducted 2 trials at obstetrics and gynecology practices in the Bronx, New York, from 2008 to 2011. The Provider Approaches to Improved Rates of Infant Nutrition & Growth Study (PAIRINGS) had 2 arms: usual care versus pre- and postnatal visits with a lactation consultant (LC) and electronically prompted guidance from prenatal care providers (EP). The Best Infant Nutrition for Good Outcomes (BINGO) study had 4 arms: usual care, LC alone, EP alone, or LC+EP.

1735,"Neighborhood socioeconomic status predictors of physical activity through young to middle adulthood: the CARDIA study Neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) is related to a wide range of health outcomes, but existing research is dominated by cross-sectional study designs, which are particularly vulnerable to bias by unmeasured characteristics related to both residential location decisions and health-related outcomes. Further, little is known about the mechanisms by which neighborhood SES might influence health. Therefore, we estimated longitudinal relationships between neighborhood SES and physical activity (PA), a theorized mediator of the neighborhood SES-health association. We used data from four years of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n = 5115, 18-30 years at baseline, 1985-1986), a cohort of U.S. young adults followed over 15 years, and a time-varying geographic information system. Using two longitudinal modeling strategies, this is the first study to explicitly examine how the estimated association between neighborhood SES (deprivation) and PA is biased by (a) measured characteristics theorized to influence residential decisions (e.g., controlling for individual SES, marriage, and children in random effects models), and (b) time-invariant, unmeasured characteristics (e.g., controlling for unmeasured motivation to exercise that is constant over time using repeated measures regression modeling, conditioned on the individual). After controlling for sociodemographics (age, sex, race) and individual SES, associations between higher neighborhood deprivation and lower PA were strong and incremental in blacks, but less consistent in whites. Furthermore, adjustment for measured characteristics beyond sociodemographics and individual SES had little influence on the estimated associations; adjustment for unmeasured characteristics attenuated negative associations more strongly in whites than in blacks.

1736,"The neighborhood energy balance equation: does neighborhood food retail environment + physical activity environment = obesity? The CARDIA study BACKGROUND: Recent obesity prevention initiatives focus on healthy neighborhood design, but most research examines neighborhood food retail and physical activity (PA) environments in isolation. We estimated joint, interactive, and cumulative impacts of neighborhood food retail and PA environment characteristics on body mass index (BMI) throughout early adulthood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used cohort data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study [n=4,092; Year 7 (24-42 years, 1992-1993) followed over 5 exams through Year 25 (2010-2011); 12,921 person-exam observations], with linked time-varying geographic information system-derived neighborhood environment measures. Using regression with fixed effects for individuals, we modeled time-lagged BMI as a function of food and PA resource density (counts per population) and neighborhood development intensity (a composite density score). We controlled for neighborhood poverty, individual-level sociodemographics, and BMI in the prior exam; and included significant interactions between neighborhood measures and by sex. Using model coefficients, we simulated BMI reductions in response to single and combined neighborhood improvements. Simulated increase in supermarket density (from 25(th) to 75(th) percentile) predicted inter-exam reduction in BMI of 0.09 kg/m(2) [estimate (95% CI): -0.09 (-0.16, -0.02)]. Increasing commercial PA facility density predicted BMI reductions up to 0.22 kg/m(2) in men, with variation across other neighborhood features [estimate (95% CI) range: -0.14 (-0.29, 0.01) to -0.22 (-0.37, -0.08)]. Simultaneous increases in supermarket and commercial PA facility density predicted inter-exam BMI reductions up to 0.31 kg/m(2) in men [estimate (95% CI) range: -0.23 (-0.39, -0.06) to -0.31 (-0.47, -0.15)] but not women. Reduced fast food restaurant and convenience store density and increased public PA facility density and neighborhood development intensity did not predict reductions in BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that improvements in neighborhood food retail or PA environments may accumulate to reduce BMI, but some neighborhood changes may be less beneficial to women.",,,9,,,
1737,"Built and socioeconomic environments: patterning and associations with physical activity in U.S. adolescents BACKGROUND: Inter-relationships among built and socioeconomic environmental characteristics may result in confounding of associations between environment exposure measures and health behaviors or outcomes, but traditional multivariate adjustment can be inappropriate due to collinearity. METHODS: We used principal factor analysis to describe inter-relationships between a large set of Geographic Information System-derived built and socioeconomic environment measures for adolescents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Wave I, 1995-96, n = 17,294). Using resulting factors in sex-stratified multivariate negative binomial regression models, we tested for confounding of associations between built and socioeconomic environment characteristics and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Finally, we used knowledge gained from factor analysis to construct replicable environmental measures that account for inter-relationships and avoid collinearity. RESULTS: Using factor analysis, we identified three built environment constructs [(1) homogenous landscape; 2) development intensity with high pay facility count; 3) development intensity with high public facility count] and two socioeconomic environment constructs [1) advantageous economic environment, 2) disadvantageous social environment]. In regression analysis, confounding of built environment-MVPA associations by socioeconomic environment factors was stronger than among built environment factors. In fully adjusted models, MVPA was negatively associated with the highest (versus lowest) quartile of homogenous land cover in males [exp(coeff) (95% CI): 0.91 (0.86, 0.96)] and intensity (pay facilities) [exp(coeff) (95% CI): 0.92 (0.85, 0.99)] in females. Single proxy measures (Simpson's diversity index, count of pay facilities, count of public facilities, median household income, and crime rate) representing each environmental construct replicated associations with MVPA. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental characteristics are inter-related. Both built and SES environments should be incorporated into analysis in order to minimize confounding. Single environmental measures may be useful proxies for environmental constructs in longitudinal analysis and replication in external populations, but more research is needed to better understand mechanisms of action, and ultimately identify policy-relevant environmental determinants of physical activity.",,,9,,,
1738,"Life stage and sex specificity in relationships between the built and socioeconomic environments and physical activity BACKGROUND: In the largely cross-sectional literature, built environment characteristics such as walkability and recreation centres are variably related to physical activity. Subgroup-specific effects could help explain inconsistent findings, yet few studies have compared built environment associations by key characteristics such as sex or life stage. METHODS: Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (wave I 1994-5, wave III 2001-2; n=12 701) and a linked geographic information system, cross-sectional relationships between moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) bouts and built and socioeconomic environment measures were estimated. Negative binomial generalised estimating equation regression modelled MVPA as a function of log-transformed environment measures, controlling for individual sociodemographics and testing for interactions with sex and life stage (waves I and III, when respondents were adolescents and young adults, respectively). RESULTS: Higher landscape diversity (coefficient 0.040; 95% CI 0.019 to 0.062) and lower crime (coefficient -0.047; 95% CI -0.071 to -0.022) were related to greater weekly MVPA regardless of sex or life stage. Higher street connectivity was marginally related to lower MVPA (coefficient -0.176; 95% CI -0.357 to 0.005) in females but not males. Pay facilities and public facilities per 10 000 population and median household income were unrelated to MVPA. CONCLUSIONS: Similar relationships between higher MVPA and higher landscape diversity and lower crime rate across sex and life stage suggest that application of these environment features may benefit broad populations. Sex-specific associations for street connectivity may partly account for the variation in findings across studies and have implications for targeting physical activity promotion strategies.",,,9,,,
1739,"Obesogenic environments in youth: concepts and methods from a longitudinal national sample To effectively prevent and reduce childhood obesity through healthy community design, it is essential to understand which neighborhood environment features influence weight gain in various age groups. However, most neighborhood environment research is cross-sectional, focuses on adults, and is often carried out in small, nongeneralizable geographic areas. Thus, there is a great need for longitudinal neighborhood environment research in diverse populations across the life cycle. This paper describes (1) insights and challenges of longitudinal neighborhood environment research and (2) advancements and remaining gaps in measurement and study design that examine individuals and neighborhoods within the context of the broader community. Literature-based research and findings from the Obesity and Neighborhood Environment Database (ONEdata), a unique longitudinal GIS that is spatially and temporally linked to data in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=20,745), provide examples of current limitations in this area of research. Findings suggest a need for longitudinal methodologic advancements to better control for dynamic sources of bias, investigate and capture appropriate temporal frameworks, and address complex residential location processes within families. Development of improved neighborhood environment measures that capture relevant geographic areas within complex communities and investigation of differences across urbanicity and sociodemographic composition are needed. Further longitudinal research is needed to identify, refine, and evaluate national and local policies to most effectively reduce childhood obesity.

1740,"Environment and Physical Activity Dynamics: The Role of Residential Self-selection OBJECTIVES: Within the socio-ecologic framework, diet and physical activity are influenced by individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy factors. A basic principle underlying this framework is that environments can influence an individual's behavior. However, in the vast majority of cross-sectional and even the few longitudinal studies of this relationship, the question of whether individuals select their area of residence based on physical activity-related amenities is ignored. In this paper, we address a critical methodological issue: self-selection of residential location, which is generally not accounted for, and can significantly compromise research on the relationship between environmental factors and physical activity behaviors. METHOD: We define and discuss the problem of residential self-selection in the study of neighborhood influences on health and health behavior, review methods used to control for residential self-selection in the literature, and present our strategy for addressing this potentially important source of bias. CONCLUSION: Existing research has built our understanding of residential self-selection bias, but important gaps remain. Our strategy uses data from a longitudinal cohort study linked to contemporaneous environmental measures to create a multi-equation model system to simultaneously estimate residential choice, environmental influences on physical activity, and downstream health outcomes such as obesity and clinical cardiovascular disease risk factor measures.",,,9,,,
1741,"Fast food restaurants and food stores: longitudinal associations with diet in young to middle-aged adults: the CARDIA study BACKGROUND: A growing body of cross-sectional, small-sample research has led to policy strategies to reduce food deserts--neighborhoods with little or no access to healthy foods--by limiting fast food restaurants and small food stores and increasing access to supermarkets in low-income neighborhoods. METHODS: We used 15 years of longitudinal data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort of US young adults (aged 18-30 years at baseline) (n = 5115), with linked time-varying geographic information system-derived food resource measures. Using repeated measures from 4 examination periods (n = 15,854 person-examination observations) and conditional regression (conditioned on the individual), we modeled fast food consumption, diet quality, and adherence to fruit and vegetable recommendations as a function of fast food chain, supermarket, or grocery store availability (counts per population) within less than 1.00 km, 1.00 to 2.99 km, 3.00 to 4.99 km, and 5.00 to 8.05 km of respondents' homes. Models were sex stratified, controlled for individual sociodemographic characteristics and neighborhood poverty, and tested for interaction by individual-level income. RESULTS: Fast food consumption was related to fast food availability among low-income respondents, particularly within 1.00 to 2.99 km of home among men (coefficient, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.51). Greater supermarket availability was generally unrelated to diet quality and fruit and vegetable intake, and relationships between grocery store availability and diet outcomes were mixed. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide some evidence for zoning restrictions on fast food restaurants within 3 km of low-income residents but suggest that increased access to food stores may require complementary or alternative strategies to promote dietary behavior change.",,,4,,,
1742,"Residential self-selection bias in the estimation of built environment effects on physical activity between adolescence and young adulthood BACKGROUND: Built environment research is dominated by cross-sectional designs, which are particularly vulnerable to residential self-selection bias resulting from health-related attitudes, neighborhood preferences, or other unmeasured characteristics related to both neighborhood choice and health-related outcomes. METHODS: We used cohort data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (United States; Wave I, 1994-95; Wave III, 2001-02; n = 12,701) and a time-varying geographic information system. Longitudinal relationships between moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) bouts and built and socioeconomic environment measures (landcover diversity, pay and public physical activity facilities per 10,000 population, street connectivity, median household income, and crime rate) from adolescence to young adulthood were estimated using random effects models (biased by unmeasured confounders) and fixed effects models (within-person estimator, which adjusts for unmeasured confounders that are stable over time). RESULTS: Random effects models yielded null associations except for negative crime-MVPA associations [coefficient (95% CI): -0.056 (-0.083, -0.029) in males, -0.061 (-0.090, -0.033) in females]. After controlling for measured and time invariant unmeasured characteristics using within-person estimators, MVPA was higher with greater physical activity pay facilities in males [coefficient (95% CI): 0.024 (0.006, 0.042)], and lower with higher crime rates in males [coefficient (95% CI): -0.107 (-0.140, -0.075)] and females [coefficient (95% CI): -0.046 (-0.083, -0.009)]. Other associations were null or in the counter-intuitive direction. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of within-person estimates to estimates unadjusted for unmeasured characteristics suggest that residential self-selection can bias associations toward the null, as opposed to its typical characterization as a positive confounder. Differential environment-MVPA associations by residential relocation suggest that studies examining changes following residential relocation may be vulnerable to selection bias. The authors discuss complexities of adjusting for residential self-selection and residential relocation, particularly during the adolescent to young adult transition.",,,9,,,
1743,"Marriage and parenthood in relation to obesogenic neighborhood trajectories: The CARDIA study Marriage and parenthood are associated with weight gain and residential mobility. Little is known about how obesity-relevant environmental contexts differ according to family structure. We estimated trajectories of neighborhood poverty, population density, and density of fast food restaurants, supermarkets, and commercial and public physical activity facilities for adults from a biracial cohort (CARDIA, n=4,174, aged 25-50) over 13 years (1992-93 through 2005-06) using latent growth curve analysis. We estimated associations of marriage, parenthood, and race with the observed neighborhood trajectories. Married participants tended to live in neighborhoods with lower poverty, population density, and availability of all types of food and physical activity amenities. Parenthood was similarly but less consistently related to neighborhood characteristics. Marriage and parenthood were more strongly related to neighborhood trajectories in whites (versus blacks), who, in prior studies, exhibit weaker associations between neighborhood characteristics and health. Greater understanding of how interactive family and neighborhood environments contribute to healthy living is needed. Copyright _ 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,9,,,
1744,"What neighborhood area captures built environment features related to adolescent physical activity? In research investigating built environment (BE) influences on physical activity (PA), inconsistent neighborhood definitions may contribute to inconsistent findings. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Wave I; 1994-95), we compared associations between moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) and PA facility counts and street connectivity measures (intersection density and link:node ratio) within 1, 3, 5, and 8.05 km of each respondent's residence (Euclidean neighborhood buffers). BE-MVPA associations varied by BE characteristic, urbanicity, and sex. PA facilities within 3 km buffers and intersection density within 1 km buffers exhibited the most consistent associations with MVPA. Policy recommendations and corresponding research should address potential differences in relevant neighborhood areas across environment feature and population subgroup.

1745,"Unmet social support for healthy behaviors among overweight and obese postpartum women: results from the Active Mothers Postpartum Study BACKGROUND: In the United States, about two thirds of women of reproductive age are overweight or obese. Postpartum is a transitional period. Life changes during this time can put mothers under high levels of stress when interpersonal support is inadequate. This study sought to explore predictors of unmet social support (support inadequacy) for healthy behaviors among postpartum women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy. METHODS: Potential predictors of unmet social support for healthy behaviors were derived from baseline and 6-month postpartum data from the Active Mothers Postpartum (AMP) study. The Postpartum Support Questionnaire queried three dimensions of social support: (1) informational support, (2) emotional support, and (3) instrumental support. The main outcome, the overall Unmet Social Support Score (USSS), was the sum of the differences between the perceived need of support and perceived receipt of support in all three dimensions. Subscores were defined for each of the three support dimensions. RESULTS: One hundred ninety women completed the 6-month Postpartum Support Questionnaire. Depression (p=0.018), unmarried status (p=0.049), and postpartum weight gain (p=0.003) were crude predictors for the overall USSS. After controlling for covariates, depression (p=0.009) and living with a spouse (p=0.040) were significant predictors for overall USSS. In adjusted analysis, depression remained a significant predictor for unmet emotional (p=0.035) and instrumental (p=0.001) social support. CONCLUSIONS: Certain psychosocial factors predict support inadequacy expectations among postpartum women. Targeting the factors related to unmet social support may be a helpful way to promote healthy behaviors among overweight postpartum women.",,,2,,,
1746,"Peers for progress: promoting peer support for health around the world INTRODUCTION: Peers for Progress, a global initiative of the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation, developed out of the World Health Organization (WHO) Consultation on Peer Support Programmes in Diabetes as a strategic approach to promote best practices in peer support for health around the world. Why peer support. People often find themselves on their own to manage complex factors for behaviour change. Peer support can link people sharing experiences to provide the practical, emotional, and ongoing support that is critical to sustained behaviour change. The need. Diabetes is a global epidemic that affects all aspects of people's lives for the rest of their lives. The complexity of self-management requires ongoing support for effective and sustained management. Key principles, strategies, activities. Peers for Progress aims to strengthen evidence of the value of peer support through evaluation grants, encourage recognition of a state-of-the-art in peer support through defining key functions of support that can be tailored and applied globally, and promote peer support through networking with programmes and leaders around the world. CONCLUSIONS: People seeking to prevent or manage health conditions can be a powerful source of support to each other to manage complex behaviors. Peers for Progress has a defined functional framework for peer support's core functions, and is evaluating the scope and impact of peer support interventions based on this framework and a set of consensus evaluation measures. Peers for Progress looks to raise the visibility and applicability of peer support as good health care for all people.",,,0,,,
1747,"A genome-wide association study of anorexia nervosa Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex and heritable eating disorder characterized by dangerously low body weight. Neither candidate gene studies nor an initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) have yielded significant and replicated results. We performed a GWAS in 2907 cases with AN from 14 countries (15 sites) and 14_860 ancestrally matched controls as part of the Genetic Consortium for AN (GCAN) and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 (WTCCC3). Individual association analyses were conducted in each stratum and meta-analyzed across all 15 discovery data sets. Seventy-six (72 independent) single nucleotide polymorphisms were taken forward for in silico (two data sets) or de novo (13 data sets) replication genotyping in 2677 independent AN cases and 8629 European ancestry controls along with 458 AN cases and 421 controls from Japan. The final global meta-analysis across discovery and replication data sets comprised 5551 AN cases and 21_080 controls. AN subtype analyses (1606 AN restricting; 1445 AN binge-purge) were performed. No findings reached genome-wide significance. Two intronic variants were suggestively associated: rs9839776 (P=3.01 _ 10(-7)) in SOX2OT and rs17030795 (P=5.84 _ 10(-6)) in PPP3CA. Two additional signals were specific to Europeans: rs1523921 (P=5.76 _ 10(-)(6)) between CUL3 and FAM124B and rs1886797 (P=8.05 _ 10(-)(6)) near SPATA13. Comparing discovery with replication results, 76% of the effects were in the same direction, an observation highly unlikely to be due to chance (P=4 _ 10(-6)), strongly suggesting that true findings exist but our sample, the largest yet reported, was underpowered for their detection. The accrual of large genotyped AN case-control samples should be an immediate priority for the field.",,,8,,,
1748,"Genome-wide meta-analysis of common variant differences between men and women The male-to-female sex ratio at birth is constant across world populations with an average of 1.06 (106 male to 100 female live births) for populations of European descent. The sex ratio is considered to be affected by numerous biological and environmental factors and to have a heritable component. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of common allele modest effects at autosomal and chromosome X variants that could explain the observed sex ratio at birth. We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association scan (GWAS) meta-analysis across 51 studies, comprising overall 114 863 individuals (61 094 women and 53 769 men) of European ancestry and 2 623 828 common (minor allele frequency >0.05) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Allele frequencies were compared between men and women for directly-typed and imputed variants within each study. Forward-time simulations for unlinked, neutral, autosomal, common loci were performed under the demographic model for European populations with a fixed sex ratio and a random mating scheme to assess the probability of detecting significant allele frequency differences. We do not detect any genome-wide significant (P < 5 _ 10(-8)) common SNP differences between men and women in this well-powered meta-analysis. The simulated data provided results entirely consistent with these findings. This large-scale investigation across ~115 000 individuals shows no detectable contribution from common genetic variants to the observed skew in the sex ratio. The absence of sex-specific differences is useful in guiding genetic association study design, for example when using mixed controls for sex-biased traits.",,,8,,,
1749,"Gender Differences in Work-Family Guilt in Parents of Young Children The transition to parenthood is a watershed moment for most parents, introducing the possibility of intra-individual and interpersonal growth or decline. Given the increasing number of dual-earner couples in the United States, new parents_ attitudes towards employment (as well as the ways in which they balance employment and personal demands) may have an impact on their overall well-being. Based on anecdotal accounts, guilt about the conflict between employment and family (termed work-family guilt) appears particularly pervasive among U.S. mothers of young children; specifically, mothers, but not fathers, express high levels of a subtype of work-family guilt, that pertains to the negative impact their work has on their families (termed work-interfering-with-family guilt). However, little research within psychology has explicitly examined this phenomenon, and to our knowledge, no quantitative study has investigated gender differences in work-family guilt among U.S. parents of young children. In a cross-sectional, correlational study involving 255 parents of toddlers from the greater Southern California area, we coded parents_ narrative responses to a series of open-ended questions regarding employment and family for the presence of work-family guilt and work-interfering-with-family guilt (in the form of guilt about the negative impact of employment on children). Mothers had significantly higher work-family guilt and work-interfering-with-family guilt relative to fathers. We discuss our findings in terms of theory on gender roles, as well as the questions they generate for future areas of investigation.",,,1,,,
1750,"Bringing Work Home: Gender and Parenting Correlates of Work-Family Guilt among Parents of Toddlers Anecdotal evidence abounds suggesting that as compared to fathers, mothers report greater guilt regarding the negative impact of work on family (WIF-guilt), yet shockingly few quantitative studies have evaluated gender differences or correlates of WIF-guilt. In five studies, we provide an in-depth exploration of parents_ feelings of guilt regarding perceived negative impacts on their children that arise from addressing work over familial responsibilities. We accomplish the following: (1) examine the validity of a novel self-report questionnaire of WIF-guilt (Work-Interfering-With-Family Guilt Scale [WIFGS]), (2) assess gender differences in WIF-guilt in parents of young children (ages 1_3), as well as whether these differences are moderated by WIF-conflict and work demand (number of hours worked), and (3) examine whether higher WIF-guilt predicts more permissive parenting. WIFGS scores were predictably associated with related psychological constructs. Mothers reported significantly higher levels of WIF-guilt than fathers. These effects were enhanced among mothers with high WIF-conflict and a high number of working hours. Consistent with anecdotal accounts and theory, WIF-guilt was associated with higher parenting permissiveness. Results provide directions for additional research on parents_ emotional experiences.",,,2,,,
1751,"A hypothesis-driven weight-of-evidence analysis to evaluate potential endocrine activity of perfluorohexanoic acid Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a potential impurity and environmental degradation product of C6-based fluorotelomer products. Considering the potential endocrine activity of perfluoroalkyl acids, a hypothesis-driven weight-of-evidence (WoE) analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential endocrine disruptor activity of PFHxA, as defined by World Health Organization (WHO), across estrogen (E), androgen (A), thyroid (T), and steroidogenesis (S) pathways. A comprehensive literature search identified primary and secondary studies across species for review. The ToxCast/Tox21 database provided in vitro data. Studies identified were reviewed for reliability, and relevance, with endocrine endpoints ranked, and lines of evidence evaluated across pathways. Overall, PFHxA showed no endocrine effects in Japanese medaka, juvenile rainbow trout, chickens or reproductive parameters in northern bobwhite with no significant activity in rodent repeated-dose toxicity, lifetime cancer, or reproductive and developmental studies. In vitro, there was weak or negative activity for T transport protein or activation of E, A or T receptors. PFHxA was also negative in vitro and in vivo for disrupting steroidogenesis. Based on this WoE endocrine analysis, PFHxA exposure did not cause adverse effects associated with alterations in endocrine activity in these models, as such would not be characterized as an endocrine disruptor according to the WHO definition.

1752,"Serum acute phase reactants hallmark healthy individuals at risk for acetaminophen-induced liver injury BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly used analgesic. However, its use is associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). It is a prominent cause of acute liver failure, with APAP hepatotoxicity far exceeding other causes of acute liver failure in the United States. In order to improve its safe use this study aimed to identify individuals at risk for DILI prior to drug treatment by searching for non-genetic serum markers in healthy subjects susceptible to APAP-induced liver injury (AILI). METHODS: Healthy volunteers (n_=_36) received either placebo or acetaminophen at the maximum daily dose of 4 g for 7 days. Blood samples were taken prior to and after APAP treatment. Serum proteomic profiling was done by 2D SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry. Additionally, the proteins C-reactive protein, haptoglobin and hemopexin were studied by quantitative immunoassays. RESULTS: One-third of study subjects presented more than four-fold increased alanine transaminase activity to evidence liver injury, while serum proteomics informed on 20 proteins as significantly regulated. These function primarily in acute phase and immune response. Pre-treatment associations included C-reactive protein, haptoglobin isoforms and retinol binding protein being up to six-fold higher in AILI susceptible individuals, whereas alpha1-antitrypsin, serum amyloid A, kininogen and transtyretin were regulated by nearly five-fold in AILI responders. When compared with published findings for steatohepatitis and cases of hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed DILI, 10 proteins were identified as uniquely associated with risk for AILI, including plasminogen. Notably, this zymogen facilitates macrophage chemotactic migration and inflammatory response as reported for plasminogen-deficient mice shown to be resistant to APAP hepatotoxicity. Finally, analysis of a publicly available database of gene expression profiles of cultures of human hepatocytes treated with drugs labeled as no- (n_=_8), low- (n_=_45) or most-DILI-concern (n_=_39) confirmed regulation of the identified biomarkers to demonstrate utility in predicting risk for liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: The significant regulation of acute phase reactants points to an important link between AILI and the immune system. Monitoring of serum acute phase reactants prior to drug treatment may contribute to prevention and management of AILI, and may also be of utility for other drugs with known liver liabilities.",,,1,,,
1753,"Factors related to partner involvement in development of the US national physical activity plan CONTEXT: Physical activity coalitions are increasingly forming to meet the demands associated with policy, systems, and environmental change necessary to realize increases in population levels of physical activity. Little is known about what makes physical activity coalitions successful; however, evidence from community-based coalitions in other public health domains suggests that factors related to each organization that joins a coalition may explain coalition success or failure. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to employ qualitative methods to understand the factors related to organizations' decisions to join and remain committed to the coalition that developed and launched the US National Physical Activity Plan (NPAP). DESIGN/SETTING: Qualitative semistructured phone interviews were conducted with key informants from the NPAP coalition's partner organizations. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded separately by members of the research team. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen individuals representing 13 NPAP partner organizations participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analysis focused on key factors explaining why and how partner organizations decided to join and remain committed to the NPAP coalition. RESULTS: Five primary factors emerged: (1) strategic alignment, (2) organizational alignment, (3) provide input, (4) seminal event, and (5) cost/benefit ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Building and maintaining a physical activity coalition with highly committed partners may hinge upon the ability to fully understand how each current or prospective partner perceives it could benefit from strategic alignment with the coalition, aligning with other organizations involved with the coalition, having input with the coalition's activities, participating in important events and products of the coalition, and realizing more overall advantages than disadvantages for participating in the coalition.",,,9,,,
1754,"Physical activity and sleep among pregnant women Sleep disturbances are common among pregnant women and safe treatments to improve sleep are needed. Generally, physical activity improves sleep, but studies are lacking on the associations of physical activity with sleep among pregnant women. Our aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association of various modes of physical activity and activity clusters with sleep quality and duration among 1259 pregnant women. Participants were recruited into the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study from prenatal clinics at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. Women self-reported sleep quality and duration and physical activity in the past week. We used cluster analysis to create seven physical activity profiles and multivariable logistic regression analysis, with adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, parity, self-rated general health, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Women with higher levels of occupational physical activity were more likely to report either short or normal sleep duration than longer duration. Women with higher levels of indoor household physical activity were less likely to report normal sleep duration than shorter duration. Women in the recreational-indoor household activity cluster were less likely than women in the inactivity cluster to report normal sleep duration as compared with longer duration. Our data suggest weak associations of physical activity with sleep duration and quality in late pregnancy. Physical activity is recommended to pregnant women for health benefits, yet more research is needed to understand if physical activity should be recommended for improving sleep.",,,9,,,

1756,"Working to eat: Vulnerability, food insecurity, and obesity among migrant and seasonal farmworker families BACKGROUND: Food insecurity and obesity have potential health consequences for migrant and seasonal farm workers (MSFW). METHODS: Thirty-six Latino MSFW working in eastern North Carolina whose children attended Migrant Head Start completed interviews, focus groups and home visits. Content analysis, nutrient analysis, and non-parametric statistical analysis produced results. RESULTS: MSFW (63.8%) families were food insecure; of those, 34.7% experienced hunger. 32% of pre-school children were food insecure. Food secure families spent more money on food. Obesity was prevalent in adults and children but the relationship to food insecurity remains unclear. Strategies to reduce risk of foods insecurity were employed by MSFW, but employer and community assistance is needed to reduce their risk. CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity is rooted in the cultural lifestyle of farmwork, poverty, and dependency. MSFW obesity and food insecurity require further study to determine the relationship with migration and working conditions. Networking and social support are important for MSFW families to improve food security. Policies and community/workplace interventions could reduce risk of food insecurity and improve the health of workers. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,,2,,,

DESIGN: We used data from the longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study for 1169 African-Americans and 1322 whites. To assess racial discrimination, we used a four category variable to capture the extent and persistence of self-reported discrimination between examination at years 7 (1992-1993) and 15 (2000-2001). We assessed smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity at year 20 (2005-2006). Segregation was examined as the racial/ethnic composition at the Census tract level. RESULTS: Discrimination was more common in African-Americans (89.1%) than in whites (40.0%). Living in areas with high percentage of blacks was associated with less reports of discrimination in African-Americans but more reports in whites. After adjustment for selected characteristics including individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic conditions and segregation, we found significant positive associations of discrimination with smoking and alcohol consumption in African-Americans and with smoking in whites. African-Americans experiencing moderate or high discrimination were more physically active than those reporting no discrimination. Whites reporting some discrimination were also more physically active than those reporting no discrimination. We observed no interactions between discrimination and segregation measures in African-Americans or whites for any of the three health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Racial discrimination may impact individuals' adoption of healthy and unhealthy behaviors independent of racial/ethnic segregation. These behaviors may help individuals buffer or reduce the stress of discrimination.",,,4,,,
1758,"Correlates of dietary intake in youth with diabetes: results from the SEARCH for diabetes in youth study OBJECTIVE: To explore demographic, socioeconomic, diabetes-related, and behavioral correlates of dietary intake of dairy, fruit, vegetables, sweetened soda, fiber, calcium, and saturated fat in youth with diabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of youth 10-22 years old with type 1 (T1DM, n = 2,176) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM, n = 365). Association of dietary intake, demographics, socioeconomic status, behavioral, and diabetes-related measures was explored with quantile regression. RESULTS: T1DM males had lower consumption of vegetables, fruit, and fiber, and higher consumption of soda and saturated fat than females (P < .01). African Americans had lower dairy and higher soda intake than non-Hispanic T1DM whites (P < .01). Soda consumption was higher in older T2DM youth than in younger participants (P < .01). Lifestyle and physical activity patterns were also significantly associated with dietary intake. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Identified demographic and behavioral correlates may help dietitians to focus on groups of youth with diabetes who have lower adherence to a healthful diet. Diet counseling groups may be tailored according to these major determinants. Copyright _ 2011 Society for Nutrition Education. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,4,,,
1759,"Sugar-sweetened and diet beverage consumption is associated with cardiovascular risk factor profile in youth with type 1 diabetes The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among youth with type 1 diabetes is high and associated with age, gender, and race/ethnicity. It has also been shown that youth with type 1 diabetes often do not follow dietary recommendations. The objective of this cross-sectional observational study was to explore the association of sugar-sweetened and diet beverage intake with A1c, plasma lipids, adiponectin, leptin, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure in youth with type 1 diabetes. We examined data from 1,806 youth age 10-22_years with type 1 diabetes, of which 22% were minority (10% Hispanic, 8% African Americans, 4% other races) and 48% were female. Sugar-sweetened beverage, diet beverage, and mineral water intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. After adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical covariates, physical activity and total energy intake, high sugar-sweetened beverage intake (at least one serving per day vs. none), was associated with higher levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides, but not with A1c. High diet beverage intake was associated with higher A1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. These associations were partially confounded by body mass index, saturated fat and total fiber intake. High sugar-sweetened beverage intake may have an adverse effect on CVD risk in youth with type 1 diabetes. Diet beverage intake may be a marker of unhealthy lifestyle which, in turn, is associated with worse metabolic control and CVD risk profile in these youth. Youth with diabetes should be encouraged to minimize sugar-sweetened beverage intake.",,,4,,,
1760,"Comprehensive control of human papillomavirus infections and related diseases Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is recognized as one of the major causes of infection-related cancer worldwide, as well as the causal factor in other diseases. Strong evidence for a causal etiology with HPV has been stated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer for cancers of the cervix uteri, penis, vulva, vagina, anus and oropharynx (including base of the tongue and tonsils). Of the estimated 12.7 million new cancers occurring in 2008 worldwide, 4.8% were attributable to HPV infection, with substantially higher incidence and mortality rates seen in developing versus developed countries. In recent years, we have gained tremendous knowledge about HPVs and their interactions with host cells, tissues and the immune system; have validated and implemented strategies for safe and efficacious prophylactic vaccination against HPV infections; have developed increasingly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic tools for HPV detection for use in cervical cancer screening; and have substantially increased global awareness of HPV and its many associated diseases in women, men, and children. While these achievements exemplify the success of biomedical research in generating important public health interventions, they also generate new and daunting challenges: costs of HPV prevention and medical care, the implementation of what is technically possible, socio-political resistance to prevention opportunities, and the very wide ranges of national economic capabilities and health care systems. Gains and challenges faced in the quest for comprehensive control of HPV infection and HPV-related cancers and other disease are summarized in this review. The information presented may be viewed in terms of a reframed paradigm of prevention of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases that will include strategic combinations of at least four major components: 1) routine introduction of HPV vaccines to women in all countries, 2) extension and simplification of existing screening programs using HPV-based technology, 3) extension of adapted screening programs to developing populations, and 4) consideration of the broader spectrum of cancers and other diseases preventable by HPV vaccination in women, as well as in men. Despite the huge advances already achieved, there must be ongoing efforts including international advocacy to achieve widespread-optimally universal-implementation of HPV prevention strategies in both developed and developing countries. This article summarizes information from the chapters presented in a special ICO Monograph 'Comprehensive Control of HPV Infections and Related Diseases' Vaccine Volume 30, Supplement 5, 2012.

1761,"Reproducibility of reported nutrient intake and supplement use during a past pregnancy: a report from the Children's Oncology Group Maternal diet and nutrition have been thought to play a role in many childhood conditions. Studies using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) have reported associations with maternal diet, but these findings are difficult to interpret because the reliability and validity of the FFQs for diet during a past pregnancy are not known. We determined the reproducibility of reported diet and supplement use during a past pregnancy in a subset of mothers interviewed for a case-control study of maternal diet in relation to the risk of childhood brain tumours. Cases were Children's Oncology Group patients, diagnosed at age < 6 with medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumour from 1991 to 1997. Area code, race/ethnicity, and birth date matched controls were selected by random-digit-dialling. Case and control mothers completed a modified Willett FFQ a mean of 5 years after the index child's birth. A mean of 3.6 months later, a subset of mothers consisting of 52 case and 51 control mothers repeated the interview; these comprise the reproducibility study population. The mean intra-class correlation was 0.59 (range 0.41, 0.69) for energy-adjusted nutrients from dietary sources only; it was 0.41 (range 0.06, 0.70) when supplements were included. Agreement for reporting multivitamin use during pregnancy by time period and pattern was good to very good (kappa = 0.66-0.85). Overall, the reproducibility of nutrient estimates and supplement use in pregnancy was good and similar to that reported for adult diet.",,,1,,,
1762,"Evaluation of microarray-based DNA methylation measurement using technical replicates: the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) Study BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is a widely studied epigenetic phenomenon; alterations in methylation patterns influence human phenotypes and risk of disease. As part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip was used to measure DNA methylation in peripheral blood obtained from ~3000 African American study participants. Over 480,000 cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sites were surveyed on the HM450 BeadChip. To evaluate the impact of technical variation, 265 technical replicates from 130 participants were included in the study. RESULTS: For each CpG site, we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to compare variation of methylation levels within- and between-replicate pairs, ranging between 0 and 1. We modeled the distribution of ICC as a mixture of censored or truncated normal and normal distributions using an EM algorithm. The CpG sites were clustered into low- and high-reliability groups, according to the calculated posterior probabilities. We also demonstrated the performance of this clustering when applied to a study of association between methylation levels and smoking status of individuals. For the CpG sites showing genome-wide significant association with smoking status, most (~96%) were seen from sites in the high reliability cluster. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that CpG sites with low ICC may be excluded from subsequent association analyses, or extra caution needs to be taken for associations at such sites.",,,1,,,
1763,"Identification of a QTL for adipocyte volume and of shared genetic effects with aspartate aminotransferase Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), a liver enzyme, are elevated in patients with visceral obesity. This study examined whether adipocyte volume is under the influence of genetic factors and evaluated its genetic correlations with AST. Fasting plasma levels of 344 pedigreed baboons from the Southwest National Primate Research Center in San Antonio, TX, USA, were assayed for AST. Adipocyte volume was measured using biopsies of omental adipose tissue. Adipocyte volume, body weight, and plasma AST were heritable. Genetic correlations between the measured adiposity-related phenotypes and AST were significant. A quantitative trait locus (LOD score 3.2) for adipocyte volume was identified on the baboon homolog of human chromosome 6 near marker D6S1028. These results suggest that omental adipocyte volume is under genetic regulation and that shared genetic factors influence adiposity-associated traits and AST.",,,1,,,
1764,"Serum Calcification Propensity and Fetuin-A: Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease in Kidney Transplant Recipients BACKGROUND: ""T50,"" shortened transformation time from primary to secondary calciprotein particles may reflect deranged mineral metabolism predisposing to vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The glycoprotein fetuin-A is a major T50 determinant. METHODS: The Folic Acid_For Vascular Outcome Prevention In Transplantation (FAVORIT) cohort is a completed, large, multiethnic controlled clinical trial cohort of chronic, stable kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). We conducted a longitudinal case-cohort analysis using a randomly selected subcohort of patients, and all individual cases who developed CVD. Serum T50 and fetuin-A were determined in this total of n = 685 FAVORIT trial participants at randomization. RESULTS: During a median surveillance of 2.18-years, 311 incident or recurrent CVD events occurred. Shorter T50 (minutes) or reduced fetuin-A concentrations (g/L) were associated with CVD after adjustment for treatment assignment, systolic blood pressure, age, sex, race, preexisting CVD and diabetes, smoking, body mass index, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, kidney allograft vintage and type, calcineurin inhibitor, or lipid-lowering drug use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urinary albumin/creatinine: tertile 1 (lowest) to tertile 3 (highest) comparisons, T50, (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.89); fetuin-A, (HR 2.25; 95% CI 1.38-3.69). Elevated high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) was an effect modifier of both these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened T50, as well as reduced fetuin-A levels, ostensible promoters of vascular calcification, remained associated with greater risk for CVD outcomes, after adjustment for major CVD risk factors, measures of kidney function and damage, and KTR clinical characteristics and demographics, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term KTRs. Increased hsCRP was an effect modifier of these CVD risk associations. _ 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.",,,5,,,
1765,"Cardiometabolic Risk, Socio-Psychological Factors, and Trajectory of Grip Strength Among Older Japanese Adults OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between cardiometabolic risk (percent body fat [BF%], triglycerides [TG], high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), socio-psychological factors (education and self-rated health [SRH]), and trajectories of grip strength (GS) in older adults. METHOD: Longitudinal 8-year data from 1,381 Japanese adults aged 65 years or above were analyzed using hierarchical linear models, stratified according to gender. RESULTS: GS declined following a linear trajectory. In both genders, higher BF% was associated with weaker GS, but not with the rate of decline. GS trajectory did not correlate with baseline TG, HDL-C, or HbA1c. Cardiometabolic factors mediated educational differences in GS intercept in both genders. In women, better SRH predicted stronger GS. The effect of SRH was robust to adjustments for cardiometabolic risk. DISCUSSION: In older adults, GS and its rate of decline are selectively associated with both cardiometabolic risk and socio-psychological characteristics. Cardiometabolic risk mediates educational disparities in GS but not differences in subjective assessments of health. _ The Author(s) 2015.",,,3,,,
1766,"Analysing data from patient-reported outcome and quality of life endpoints for cancer clinical trials: a start in setting international standards Measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and other patient-reported outcomes generate important data in cancer randomised trials to assist in assessing the risks and benefits of cancer therapies and fostering patient-centred cancer care. However, the various ways these measures are analysed and interpreted make it difficult to compare results across trials, and hinders the application of research findings to inform publications, product labelling, clinical guidelines, and health policy. To address these problems, the Setting International Standards in Analyzing Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Endpoints Data (SISAQOL) initiative has been established. This consortium, directed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), was convened to provide recommendations on how to standardise the analysis of HRQOL and other patient-reported outcomes data in cancer randomised trials. This Personal View discusses the reasons why this project was initiated, the rationale for the planned work, and the expected benefits to cancer research, patient and provider decision making, care delivery, and policy making.

1767,"Moving forward toward standardizing analysis of quality of life data in randomized cancer clinical trials BACKGROUND: There is currently a lack of consensus on how health-related quality of life and other patient-reported outcome measures in cancer randomized clinical trials are analyzed and interpreted. This makes it difficult to compare results across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) synthesize scientific research, and use that evidence to inform product labeling, clinical guidelines, and health policy. The Setting International Standards in Analyzing Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Endpoints Data for Cancer Clinical Trials (SISAQOL) Consortium aims to develop guidelines and recommendations to standardize analyses of patient-reported outcome data in cancer RCTs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Members from the SISAQOL Consortium met in January 2017 to discuss relevant issues. Data from systematic reviews of the current state of published research in patient-reported outcomes in cancer RCTs indicated a lack of clear reporting of research hypothesis and analytic strategies, and inconsistency in definitions of terms, including ""missing data,""health-related quality of life,"" and ""patient-reported outcome."" Based on the meeting proceedings, the Consortium will focus on three key priorities in the coming year: developing a taxonomy of research objectives, identifying appropriate statistical methods to analyze patient-reported outcome data, and determining best practices to evaluate and deal with missing data. CONCLUSION: The quality of the Consortium guidelines and recommendations are informed and enhanced by the broad Consortium membership which includes regulators, patients, clinicians, and academics.",,,1,,,
1768,"Expression quantitative trait Loci for extreme host response to influenza a in pre-collaborative cross mice Outbreaks of influenza occur on a yearly basis, causing a wide range of symptoms across the human population. Although evidence exists that the host response to influenza infection is influenced by genetic differences in the host, this has not been studied in a system with genetic diversity mirroring that of the human population. Here we used mice from 44 influenza-infected pre-Collaborative Cross lines determined to have extreme phenotypes with regard to the host response to influenza A virus infection. Global transcriptome profiling identified 2671 transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed between mice that showed a severe (""high"") and mild (""low"") response to infection. Expression quantitative trait loci mapping was performed on those transcripts that were differentially expressed because of differences in host response phenotype to identify putative regulatory regions potentially controlling their expression. Twenty-one significant expression quantitative trait loci were identified, which allowed direct examination of genes associated with regulation of host response to infection. To perform initial validation of our findings, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed in the infected founder strains, and we were able to confirm or partially confirm more than 70% of those tested. In addition, we explored putative causal and reactive (downstream) relationships between the significantly regulated genes and others in the high or low response groups using structural equation modeling. By using systems approaches and a genetically diverse population, we were able to develop a novel framework for identifying the underlying biological subnetworks under host genetic control during influenza virus infection.",,,1,,,
1769,"Drivers of overweight mothers' food choice behaviors depend on child gender BACKGROUND: National data suggest a higher prevalence of obesity among boys. One possible cause could be the food choices made by parents on behalf of their children. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether and how mothers' food choices for their children differ by child gender and to understand the drivers of these differences. DESIGN: Data were analyzed from a randomized controlled trial conducted using a virtual reality-based buffet restaurant. Overweight mothers filled out questionnaires and received an information module. They were then immersed in a virtual buffet restaurant to select a lunch for their 4- to 5-year-old child. RESULTS: Of the 221 overweight mothers recruited, 55% identified their daughters as the child for whom they would be choosing the food. The caloric content of boys' meals was 43 calories higher than girls' (p_=_.015). This difference was due to extra calories from the less healthy food category (p_=_.04). Multivariate analyses identified more predictors of calorie choices for daughters' than sons' meals. Predictors of calories chosen for girls included: having both biological parents overweight (__=_0.26; p_=_.003), mother's weight (__=_0.17; p_=_.05), mother's education (__=_-0.28; p_=_.001), her restriction of her child's food intake (__=_-0.20; p_=_.02), and her beliefs about the importance of genetics in causing obesity (__=_0.19; p_=_.03). Mother's weight was the sole predictor of boys' meal calories (__=_0.20; p_=_.04). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in dietary choices made for young girls and boys may contribute to lifelong gender differences in eating patterns. A better understanding of differences in feeding choices made for girls versus boys could improve the design of childhood obesity prevention interventions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,,1,,,
1770,"Measurement of response regulator autodephosphorylation rates spanning six orders of magnitude Two-component regulatory systems, comprising sensor kinase and response regulator proteins, carry out signal transduction in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, as well as plants. Response regulators act as phosphorylation-mediated switches, turning on and off cellular responses to environmental stimuli. Self-catalyzed dephosphorylation is an important determinant of the duration of the response regulator activated state. Reported response regulator autodephosphorylation rates vary over almost a million-fold range, consistent with control of biological processes that occur on widely different timescales. We describe general considerations for the design and execution of in vitro assays to measure the autodephosphorylation rates of purified response regulator proteins, as well as specific methods that utilize loss of 32P, changes in fluorescence, or release of inorganic phosphate. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods are discussed, including suitability for different timescales. In addition to outlining established methods, an assay modification is proposed to measure fast autodephosphorylation rates with radioactivity, and optimization of the fluorescence/pH jump method is described.Copyright _ 2010 Elsevier Inc.

1771,"Exposure analysis methods impact associations between maternal physical activity and cesarean delivery BACKGROUND: Previous studies report conflicting results regarding a possible association between maternal physical activity (PA) and cesarean delivery. METHODS: Seven-day PA recalls were collected by telephone from pregnant women (n = 1205) from North Carolina, without prior cesarean, during 2 time windows: 17 to 22 weeks and 27 to 30 weeks completed gestation. PA was treated as a continuous, nonlinear variable in binomial regressions (log-link function); models controlled for primiparity, maternal contraindications to exercise, preeclampsia, pregravid BMI, and percent poverty. We examined both total PA and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) at each time. Outcomes data came from medical records. RESULTS: The dose-response curves between PA or MVPA and cesarean risk at 17 to 22 weeks followed an inverse J-shape, but at 27 to 30 weeks the curves reversed and were J-shaped. However, only (total) PA at 27 to 30 weeks was strongly associated with cesarean risk; this association was attenuated when women reporting large volumes of PA (> 97.5 percentile) were excluded. CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of an association between physical activity and cesarean birth. We did, however, find evidence that associations between PA and risk of cesarean may be nonlinear and dependent on gestational age at time of exposure, limiting the accuracy of analyses that collapse maternal PA into categories.",,,9,,,
1772,"Obesity-associated systemic interleukin-6 promotes pre-adipocyte aromatase expression via increased breast cancer cell prostaglandin E2 production Obesity is associated with a worse breast cancer prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor alpha (ER_) positive, postmenopausal patients. We hypothesized that this is mediated in part by an elevation in breast cancer cell cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production that results in greater local pre-adipocyte aromatase expression. We utilized an in vitro model of the obese patient's tumor microenvironment in which cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells and pre-adipocytes were exposed to pooled serum from obese (OB; BMI _ 30.0 kg/m(2)) or normal weight (N; BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) postmenopausal women. Exposure to OB versus N sera significantly increased MCF-7 cell COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Pre-adipocyte aromatase expression was 89 % greater following culture in conditioned media (CM) from MCF-7 cells exposed to OB versus N sera (OB-CM and N-CM, respectively), a difference nullified by MCF-7 cell treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Previous analysis of the sera revealed significantly higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations in the OB versus N samples. Depletion of IL-6 from the sera neutralized the difference in pre-adipocyte aromatase expression stimulated by OB-CM versus N-CM. Finally, CM from pre-adipocyte/MCF-7 cell co-cultures exposed to OB sera stimulated greater MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell ER_ activity and proliferation in comparison to N sera. This study indicates that obesity-associated systemic IL-6 indirectly enhances pre-adipocyte aromatase expression via increased breast cancer cell PGE2 production. Investigation regarding the efficacy of a COX-2 inhibitor/aromatase inhibitor combination therapy in the obese postmenopausal patient population is warranted.",,,3,,,
1773,"The flaxseed lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside decreases local inflammation, suppresses NF_B signaling, and inhibits mammary tumor growth PURPOSE: Exposure to the polyphenolic plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and its metabolite enterolactone (ENL) has been associated with reduced breast cancer progression, particularly for estrogen receptor alpha (ER_)-negative disease, and decreased preclinical mammary tumor growth. However, while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures of progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset of ER_-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (control, 10% kcal from fat) or control diet_+__DG (SDG, 100_mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks, then orthotopically injected with syngeneic E0771 mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor growth was monitored for 3 weeks. The role of reduced NF-_B signaling in SDG's anti-tumor effects was explored in vitro via treatment with the bioactive SDG metabolite ENL. In addition to the murine E0771 cells, the in vitro studies utilized MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, two human cell lines which model the triple-negative and luminal A breast cancer subtypes, respectively. RESULTS: SDG supplementation in the mice significantly reduced tumor volume and expression of phospho-p65 and NF-_B target genes (P_< _0.05). Markers of macrophage infiltration were decreased in the distal-to-tumor mammary fat pad of mice supplemented with SDG relative to control mice (P_< _0.05). In vitro, ENL treatment inhibited viability, survival, and NF-_B activity and target gene expression in E0771, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells (P_< _0.05). Overexpression of Rela attenuated ENL's inhibition of E0771 cell viability and survival. CONCLUSIONS: SDG reduces tumor growth in the E0771 model of TNBC, likely via a mechanism involving inhibition of NF-_B activity. SDG could serve as a practical and effective adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence, but greater understanding of its effects is needed to inform the development of more targeted recommendations for its use.",,,3,,,
1774,"Leptin Signaling Mediates Obesity-Associated CSC Enrichment and EMT in Preclinical TNBC Models Obesity is associated with poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Preclinical models of TNBC were used to test the hypothesis that increased leptin signaling drives obesity-associated TNBC development by promoting cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice, which develop spontaneous basal-like, triple-negative mammary tumors, received either a control diet (10% kcal from fat) or a diet-induced obesity regimen (DIO, 60% kcal from fat) for up to 42 weeks (n = 15/group). Mice were monitored for tumor development and euthanized when tumor diameter reached 1.5 cm. Tumoral gene expression was assessed via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). DIO mice had greater body weight and percent body fat at termination than controls. DIO mice, versus controls, demonstrated reduced survival, increased systemic metabolic and inflammatory perturbations, upregulated tumoral CSC/EMT gene signature, elevated tumoral aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (a CSC marker), and greater leptin signaling. In cell culture experiments using TNBC cells (murine: E-Wnt and M-Wnt; human: MDA-MB-231), leptin enhanced mammosphere formation, and media supplemented with serum from DIO versus control mice increased cell viability, migration, invasion, and CSC- and EMT-related gene expression, including Foxc2, Twist2, Vim, Akt3, and Sox2 In E-Wnt cells, knockdown of leptin receptor ablated these procancer effects induced by DIO mouse serum. These findings indicate that increased leptin signaling is causally linked to obesity-associated TNBC development by promoting CSC enrichment and EMT.Implications: Leptin-associated signals impacting CSC and EMT may provide new targets and intervention strategies for decreasing TNBC burden in obese women.

1775,"Obesity Suppresses Estrogen Receptor Beta Expression in Breast Cancer Cells via a HER2-Mediated Pathway Obesity is associated with a worse breast cancer prognosis, while greater breast tumor estrogen receptor beta (ER_) expression is correlated with improved therapy response and survival. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of obesity on breast cancer cell ER_ expression, which is currently unknown. We utilized an in vitro model of obesity in which breast cancer cells were exposed to patient serum pooled by body mass index category (obese (OB): _30 kg/m2; normal weight (N): 18.5-24.9 kg/m2). Four human mammary tumor cell lines representing the major breast cancer subtypes (SKBR3, MCF-7, ZR75, MDA-MB-231) and mammary tumor cells from MMTV-neu mice were used. ER_ expression, assessed by qPCR and western blotting, was suppressed in the two HER2-overexpressing cell lines (SKBR3, MMTV-neu) following OB versus N sera exposure, but did not vary in the other cell lines. Expression of Bcl-2 and cyclin D1, two genes negatively regulated by ER_, was elevated in SKBR3 cells following exposure to OB versus N sera, but this difference was eliminated when the ER_ gene was silenced with siRNA. Herceptin, a HER2 antagonist, and siRNA to HER2 were used to evaluate the role of HER2 in sera-induced ER_ modulation. SKBR3 cell treatment with OB sera plus Herceptin increased ER_ expression three-fold. Similar results were obtained when HER2 expression was silenced with siRNA. OB sera also promoted greater SKBR3 cell viability and growth, but this variance was not present when ER_ was silenced or the cells were modified to overexpress ER_. Based on this data, we conclude that obesity-associated systemic factors suppress ER_ expression in breast cancer cells via a HER2-mediated pathway, leading to greater cell viability and growth. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) mediating this effect could provide important insights into how ER_ expression is regulated as well as how obesity promotes a more aggressive disease.",,,3,,,
1776,"Pyrethroid insecticides maintain repellent effect on knock-down resistant populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes Pyrethroid-treated clothing is commonly worn for protection against mosquitoes; pyrethroids are both insecticides and repellents. Pyrethroid resistance has become increasingly common in Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses, but it is not clear whether resistance is associated with reductions in repellency. In order to determine whether long-lasting permethrin impregnated (LLPI) clothing is protective, we used Aedes aegypti from New Orleans, LA (pyrethroid-sensitive) and San Juan, PR (resistant) to measure both lethality and repellency. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm resistance status by detecting mutations in the kdr gene at positions 1016 and 1534. Arm-in-cage trials of 100 Aedes aegypti females from both populations were performed for 10 minutes to bare arm or an arm clothed in untreated military camouflage or military camouflage impregnated with deltamethrin, permethrin, or etofenprox. Trials were repeated 4-5 times on different days. Number of landings, number of blood meals, and immediate and 24-hour mortality were recorded. Mortality was extremely low in all trials. Compared to untreated cloth, mosquitoes demonstrated a trend towards a 2%-63% reduction in landings and a statistically significant 78-100% reduction in blood feeding on pyrethroid-treated cloth for most insecticides. Effects were observed in both pyrethroid-sensitive and pyrethroid-resistant mosquito populations. Our data show that kdr mutations are associated with pyrethroid resistance but are likely not the only contributors. Pyrethroids appear to maintain repellent effect against resistant mosquitoes. This finding suggests that even in places where pyrethroid resistance is widespread, permethrin still has a role for use as a repellent on clothing to protect against mosquito bites.",,,8,,,
1777,"Comparative population structure of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein NANP repeat lengths in Lilongwe, Malawi Humoral immunity to Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein is partly mediated by a polymorphic NANP tetra-amino acid repeat. Antibody response to these repeats is the best correlate of protective immunity to the RTS,S malaria vaccine, but few descriptions of the natural variation of these repeats exist. Using capillary electrophoresis to determine the distribution of NANP repeat size polymorphisms among 98 isolates from Lilongwe, Malawi, we characterised the diversity of P. falciparum infection by several ecological indices. Infection by multiple distinct variants was common, and 20 distinct repeat sizes were identified. Diversity of P. falciparum appeared greater in children (18 variants) than adults (12 variants). There was evidence of genetic distance between different geographic regions by Nei's Standard Genetic Distance, suggesting parasite populations vary locally. We show that P. falciparum is very diverse with respect to NANP repeat length even on a local level and that diversity appears higher in children.",,,1,,,

Determining which immunologic indicators remain surrogates of past infection, as opposed to mediators of protection, led us to compare stability of immune responses across regions with divergent malaria transmission intensities. A repeat cross-sectional study of Kenyan children from a malaria-holoendemic area and an epidemic-prone area was used to examine longitudinal antibody and interferon-gamma (IFN-_) responses to the 3D7 and FVO variants of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1). Antibodies to MSP1 were common in both study populations and did not significantly wane over a 21-month time period. IFN-_ responses were less frequent and rapidly disappeared in children after a prolonged period of no malaria transmission. Antibody and IFN-_ responses rarely correlated with each other; however, MSP1-specific IFN-_ response correlated with lack of concurrent P. falciparum parasitemia of the same genotype, though only statistically significantly in the malaria-holoendemic region (odds ratio = 0.31, 95% confidence interval = 0.12-0.84). This study affirms that antimalarial antibodies are informative for evaluation of history of malaria exposure within individuals, whereas cell-mediated immunity, though short lived under natural exposure conditions, might provide an assessment of recent infection and protection from parasitemia. _ The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",,,1,,,
1779,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with a variant in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality and has a significant heritability. We carried out a genome-wide association discovery study of 1866 patients with AAA and 5435 controls and replication of promising signals (lead SNP with a p value < 1__ 10(-5)) in 2871 additional cases and 32,687 controls and performed further follow-up in 1491 AAA and 11,060 controls. In the discovery study, nine loci demonstrated association with AAA (p < 1__ 10(-5)). In the replication sample, the lead SNP at one of these loci, rs1466535, located within intron 1 of low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) demonstrated significant association (p = 0.0042). We confirmed the association of rs1466535 and AAA in our follow-up study (p = 0.035). In a combined analysis (6228 AAA and 49182 controls), rs1466535 had a consistent effect size and direction in all sample sets (combined p = 4.52__ 10(-10), odds ratio 1.15 [1.10-1.21]). No associations were seen for either rs1466535 or the 12q13.3 locus in independent association studies of coronary artery disease, blood pressure, diabetes, or hyperlipidaemia, suggesting that this locus is specific to AAA. Gene-expression studies demonstrated a trend toward increased LRP1 expression for the rs1466535 CC genotype in arterial tissues; there was a significant (p = 0.029) 1.19-fold (1.04-1.36) increase in LRP1 expression in CC homozygotes compared to TT homozygotes in aortic adventitia. Functional studies demonstrated that rs1466535 might alter a SREBP-1 binding site and influence enhancer activity at the locus. In conclusion, this study has identified a biologically plausible genetic variant associated specifically with AAA, and we suggest that this variant has a possible functional role in LRP1 expression.

1780,"Facilitating access to sexual health services for men who have sex with men and male-to-female transgender persons in Guatemala City The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to accessing sexual health services among gay, bisexual and heterosexual-identifying men who have sex with men and male-to-female transgender persons in Guatemala City, to inform the development of high quality and population-friendly services. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 purposively sampled individuals, including 8 transgender, 16 gay/bisexual and 5 heterosexual-identifying participants. Topical codes were applied to the data using software Atlas.ti_ to compare data between sub-groups. Analysis revealed that public clinics were most commonly used due to their lower cost and greater accessibility, but many participants experienced discrimination, violation of confidentiality and distrust of these services. Transgender and gay/bisexual-identifying participants preferred clinics where they felt a sense of belonging, while heterosexual-identifying participants preferred clinics unassociated with the men who have sex with men community. The most prominent barriers to sexual health services included fear of discrimination, fear of having HIV, cost and lack of social support. Findings highlight the need to strengthen existing public sexually transmitted infection clinics so that they address the multiple layers of stigma and discrimination that men who have sex with men and transgender persons experience.",,,6,,,
1781,"Gender-Specific Jealousy and Infidelity Norms as Sources of Sexual Health Risk and Violence Among Young Coupled Nicaraguans Gender inequity negatively affects health in Central America. In 2011, we conducted 60 semistructured interviews and 12 photovoice focus groups with young coupled men and women in Le_n, Nicaragua, to explore the ways in which social norms around marriage and gender affect sexual health and gender-based violence. Participants' depictions of their experiences revealed gendered norms around infidelity that provided a narrative to justify male expressions of jealousy, which included limiting partner autonomy, sexual coercion, and physical violence against women, and resulted in increased women's risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. By understanding and taking account of these different narratives and normalized beliefs in developing health- and gender-based violence interventions, such programs might be more effective in promoting gender-equitable attitudes and behaviors among young men and women in Nicaragua.",,,2,,,
1782,"Understanding how perceptions of tobacco constituents and the FDA relate to effective and credible tobacco risk messaging: A national phone survey of U.S. adults, 2014-2015 BACKGROUND: The passage of the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act has necessitated the execution of timely, innovative, and policy-relevant tobacco control_research to inform Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory and messaging efforts. With recent dramatic changes to tobacco product availability and patterns of use, nationally representative data on tobacco-related perceptions and behaviors are vital, especially for vulnerable populations. METHODS: The UNC_Center for Regulatory Research on Tobacco Communication conducted a telephone survey with a national sample of adults ages 18 and older living in the United States (U.S.). The survey assessed regulatory relevant factors such as tobacco product use, tobacco constituent perceptions, and tobacco regulatory agency credibility. The study oversampled high smoking/low income areas as well as cell phone numbers to ensure adequate representation among smokers and young adults, respectively. Coverage extended to approximately 98_% of U.S. households. RESULTS: The final dataset (N_=_5,014) generated weighted estimates that were largely comparable to other national demographic and tobacco use estimates. Results revealed that over one quarter of U.S. adults, and over one third of smokers, reported having looked for information about tobacco constituents in cigarette smoke; however, the vast majority was unaware of what constituents might actually be present. Although only a minority of people reported trust in the federal government, two thirds felt that the FDA can effectively regulate tobacco products. CONCLUSIONS: As the FDA continues their regulatory and messaging activities, they should expand both the breadth and availability of constituent-related information, targeting these efforts to reach all segments of the U.S. population, especially those disproportionately vulnerable to tobacco product use and its associated negative health outcomes.",,,5,,,

1784,"Perceived Importance of Health Concerns Among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Adults in a National, Probability-Based Phone Survey, 2017 Perceptions of the importance of health problems can drive advocacy, policy change, resource distribution, and individual behaviors. However, little is known about how lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT), that is, sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults view the health problems facing SGM populations. In a 2017 national, probability-based survey of U.S. SGM adults (N = 453), we asked respondents to identify the most serious health problem facing SGM people today. Participants also rated the seriousness of five specific health problems (HIV/AIDS, suicide, hate crimes, harmful alcohol use, tobacco use). Analyses accounted for the complex sampling design and were stratified by gender identity. One quarter of U.S. SGM adults identified the most serious health problem facing SGM people to be HIV/AIDS (95% confidence interval [20.3, 31.2]). More respondents stated there were no serious LGBT health differences compared with straight/cisgender adults (4.2%, confidence interval [2.6, 5.9]) than identified tobacco use, hate crimes, chronic diseases, cancer, or suicide as the most serious. Importance ratings differed by gender and tobacco/alcohol use were perceived as less serious compared with HIV/AIDS, suicide, and hate crimes. Attention paid to HIV/AIDS by the SGM public, while important, may hinder efforts to address chronic diseases and other health issues affecting SGM people.",,,5,,,
1785,"A mediational model of racial discrimination and alcohol-related problems among african american college students OBJECTIVE: Racial discrimination has been identified as an important predictor of alcohol-related outcomes for African Americans. The goal of the current study was to extend previously found links between lifetime discrimination, alcohol use, and alcohol problems as well as to elucidate the affective mechanisms underlying these associations, as moderated by gender. METHOD: A multiple-groups structural equation model was computed using survey data collected from 619 students from a historically Black college/university. RESULTS: The final model provided excellent fit to the data, explaining 6% of the variance in alcohol consumption and 37% of the variance in alcohol problems. Discrimination was a significant predictor of alcohol-related problems but not, by and large, level of use. For men, anger-but not discrimination-specific anger-was a significant partial mediator of the link between discrimination and both alcohol use and alcohol problems. Depression partially mediated the link between discrimination and alcohol problems for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, for African Americans whose drinking leads to drinking-related problems, discrimination and poor affective self-regulation are highly relevant and predictive factors, especially for men.",,,1,,,
1786,"An online daily diary study of alcohol use using Amazon's Mechanical Turk INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: In recent years, unprecedented levels of Internet access and the widespread growth of emergent communication technologies have resulted in significantly greater population access for substance use researchers. Despite the research potential of such technologies, the use of the Internet to recruit individuals for participation in event-level research has been limited. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief account of the methods and results from an online daily diary study of alcohol use. DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Eligible participants completed a brief screener assessing demographics and health behaviours, with a subset of individuals subsequently recruited to participate in a 2 week daily diary study of alcohol use. RESULTS: Multilevel models of the daily alcohol data derived from the Mechanical Turk sample (n_=_369) replicated several findings commonly reported in daily diary studies of alcohol use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that online participant recruitment and survey administration can be a fruitful method for conducting daily diary alcohol research. _ 2014 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.",,,1,,,

Although its use has benefited many sectors of society, it has yet to be fully realized as a method for improving public health. This paper defines the core components of crowdsourcing and proposes a framework for understanding the potential utility of crowdsourcing in the domain of public health. Four discrete crowdsourcing approaches are described (knowledge discovery and management; distributed human intelligence tasking; broadcast search; and peer-vetted creative production types) and a number of potential applications for crowdsourcing for public health science and practice are enumerated. _ 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine Published by American Journal of Preventive Medicine All rights reserved.",,,6,,,
1788,"A trans-ancestral meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies reveals loci associated with childhood obesity Although hundreds of genome-wide association studies-implicated loci have been reported for adult obesity-related traits, less is known about the genetics specific for early-onset obesity and with only a few studies conducted in non-European populations to date. Searching for additional genetic variants associated with childhood obesity, we performed a trans-ancestral meta-analysis of 30 studies consisting of up to 13_005 cases (_95th percentile of body mass index (BMI) achieved 2-18_years old) and 15_599 controls (consistently < 50th percentile of BMI) of European, African, North/South American and East Asian ancestry. Suggestive loci were taken forward for replication in a sample of 1888 cases and 4689 controls from seven cohorts of European and North/South American ancestry. In addition to observing 18 previously implicated BMI or obesity loci, for both early and late onset, we uncovered one completely novel locus in this trans-ancestral analysis (nearest gene, METTL15). The variant was nominally associated with only the European subgroup analysis but had a consistent direction of effect in other ethnicities. We then utilized trans-ancestral Bayesian analysis to narrow down the location of the probable causal variant at each genome-wide significant signal. Of all the fine-mapped loci, we were able to narrow down the causative variant at four known loci to fewer than 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (FAIM2, GNPDA2, MC4R and SEC16B loci). In conclusion, an ethnically diverse setting has enabled us to both identify an additional pediatric obesity locus and further fine-map existing loci. _ The Author(s) 2019.

1789,"Demographic and Operational Factors Predicting Study Completion in a Multisite Case-Control Study of Preschool Children Participant attrition can limit inferences drawn from study results and inflate research costs. We examined factors associated with completion of the Study to Explore Early Development (2007-2011), a multiple-component, case-control study of risk factors for autism spectrum disorder in preschoolers, conducted in California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Participants (n = 3,769) were asked to complete phone interviews, questionnaires, an in-person evaluation, and biologic sampling. We examined whether participant demographic and administrative factors predicted completion using mixed-effects logistic regression models. Completion of individual key study components was generally 70% or higher. However, 58% of families completed all per-protocol data elements (defined a priori as key study components). Per-protocol completion differed according to mother's age, race, educational level, driving distance to clinic, number of contact attempts to enroll, and number of telephone numbers provided (all P < 0.05). Case status was not associated with completion, despite additional data collection for case-confirmation. Analysis of a subset that completed an early interview revealed no differences in completion by household factors of income, primary language spoken, number of adults, or number of children with chronic conditions. Differences in completion by race and education were notable and need to be carefully considered in developing future recruitment and completion strategies.",,,3,,,
1790,"Single-Cell Analysis of Quiescent HIV Infection Reveals Host Transcriptional Profiles that Regulate Proviral Latency A detailed understanding of the mechanisms that establish or maintain the latent reservoir of HIV will guide approaches to eliminate persistent infection. We used a cell line and primary cell models of HIV latency to investigate viral RNA (vRNA) expression and the role of the host transcriptome using single-cell approaches. Single-cell vRNA quantitation identified distinct populations of cells expressing various levels of vRNA, including completely silent populations. Strikingly, single-cell RNA-seq of latently infected primary cells demonstrated that HIV downregulation occurred in diverse transcriptomic environments but was significantly associated with expression of a specific set of cellular genes. In particular, latency was more frequent in cells expressing a transcriptional signature that included markers of naive and central memory T_cells. These data reveal that expression of HIV proviruses within the latent reservoir are influenced by the host cell transcriptional program. Therapeutic modulation of these programs may reverse or enforce HIV latency. Copyright _ 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
1791,"RAB11FIP5 Expression and Altered Natural Killer Cell Function Are Associated with Induction of HIV Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Responses HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are difficult to induce with vaccines but are generated in _50% of HIV-1-infected individuals. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of host control of bnAb induction is critical to vaccine design. Here, we performed a transcriptome analysis of blood mononuclear cells from 47 HIV-1-infected individuals who made bnAbs and 46 HIV-1-infected individuals who did not and identified in bnAb individuals upregulation of RAB11FIP5, encoding a Rab effector protein associated with recycling endosomes. Natural killer (NK) cells had the highest differential expression of RAB11FIP5, which was associated with greater dysregulation of NK cell subsets in bnAb subjects. NK cells from bnAb individuals had a more adaptive/dysfunctional phenotype and exhibited impaired degranulation and cytokine production that correlated with RAB11FIP5 transcript levels. Moreover, RAB11FIP5 overexpression modulated the function of NK cells. These data suggest that_NK cells and Rab11 recycling endosomal transport are involved in regulation of HIV-1 bnAb development.

1793,"Associations between dietary patterns and head and neck cancer: the Carolina head and neck cancer epidemiology study Few studies have examined the associations between dietary patterns and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or whether they differ by race. This was evaluated using data from a population-based case-control study (2002-2006) including 1,176 cases of head and neck SCC and 1,317 age-, race-, and gender-matched controls from central and eastern North Carolina whose diets had been assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Factor analysis identified 2 patterns of intake: 1) high consumption of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein and 2) high consumption of fried foods, high-fat and processed meats, and sweets. Associations were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for matching factors and confounders. Heterogeneity by tumor site (oral/pharyngeal vs. laryngeal) and effect-measure modification were also evaluated. Reduced odds of head and neck SCC were found for the fruit, vegetable, and lean protein pattern (for highest quartile vs. lowest, odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.39, 0.71). The fried foods, high-fat and processed meats, and sweets pattern was positively associated only with laryngeal cancer (odds ratio = 2.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.21, 3.72). These findings underline the importance of a dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables and low in high-fat and processed meats and sweets for prevention of head and neck cancer.",,,4,,,
1794,"Cardiovascular disease mortality among breast cancer survivors BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of increasing concern among breast cancer survivors. However, the burden of this comorbidity in this group relative to the general population, and its temporal pattern, remains unknown. METHODS: We compared deaths due to CVD in a population-based sample of 1,413 women with incident breast cancer diagnosed in 1996-1997, and 1,411 age-matched women without breast cancer. Date and cause of death through December 31, 2009 were assessed through the national death index and covariate data was gathered through structured interviews and medical record abstraction. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox regression for overall mortality (HR) and CVD-specific death (cause-specific HR). Subdistribution HRs for CVD death were estimated from the Fine-Gray model. RESULTS: Risk of death was greater among breast cancer survivors compared with women without breast cancer (HR: 1.8 [1.5, 2.1]). An increase in CVD-related death among breast cancer survivors was evident only 7 years after diagnosis (years 0-7, cause-specific HR: 0.80 [0.53, 1.2], subdistribution HR: 0.59 [0.40, 0.87]); years 7+, cause-specific HR: 1.8 [1.3, 2.5], subdistribution HR: 1.9 [1.4, 2.7]; P interaction: 0.001). An increase in CVD-related mortality was observed among breast cancer survivors receiving chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors are at greater risk for CVD-related mortality compared with women without breast cancer and this increase in risk is manifested approximately 7 years after diagnosis. Efforts should be made to identify risk factors and interventions that can be employed during this brief window to reduce the excess burden of CVD in this vulnerable population.",,,3,,,
1795,"Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.

1796,"Assessing a multilevel model of young children's oral health with national survey data OBJECTIVES: To empirically test a multilevel conceptual model of children's oral health incorporating 22 domains of children's oral health across four levels: child, family, neighborhood and state. DATA SOURCE: The 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, a module of the State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, is a nationally representative telephone survey of caregivers of children. STUDY DESIGN: We examined child-, family-, neighborhood-, and state-level factors influencing parent's report of children's oral health using a multilevel logistic regression model, estimated for 26 736 children ages 1-5 years. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Factors operating at all four levels were associated with the likelihood that parents rated their children's oral health as fair or poor, although most significant correlates are represented at the child or family level. Of 22 domains identified in our conceptual model, 15 domains contained factors significantly associated with young children's oral health. At the state level, access to fluoridated water was significantly associated with favorable oral health for children. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that efforts to understand or improve children's oral health should consider a multilevel approach that goes beyond solely child-level factors.",,,2,,,

At 12 months, higher SF-36 mental health composite scores were associated with less weight regain (p < .01). For Black participants, an interaction existed between race and friends' encouragement for exercise, where higher exercise encouragement was related to more weight regain (p < .05). At 30 months, friends' encouragement for healthy eating was associated with more weight regain (p < .05), whereas higher SF-36 mental health composite scores were related to less weight regain (p < .0001).

1798,"Impact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancer PURPOSE: Cancer cells have altered metabolism, with increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and biomass production. This study conducted genomic and metabolomic analyses to elucidate how tumor and stromal genomic characteristics influence tumor metabolism. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-three breast tumors and six normal breast tissues were analyzed by gene expression microarray and by mass spectrometry for metabolites. Gene expression data and clinical characteristics were evaluated in association with metabolic phenotype. To evaluate the role of stromal interactions in altered metabolism, cocultures were conducted using breast cancer cells and primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). RESULTS: Across all metabolites, unsupervised clustering resulted in two main sample clusters. Normal breast tissue and a subset of tumors with less aggressive clinical characteristics had lower levels of nucleic and amino acids and glycolysis byproducts, whereas more aggressive tumors had higher levels of these Warburg-associated metabolites. While tumor-intrinsic subtype did not predict metabolic phenotype, metabolic cluster was significantly associated with expression of a wound response signature. In cocultures, CAFs from basal-like breast cancers increased glucose uptake and basal-like epithelial cells increased glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis, suggesting interplay of stromal and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism. Cytokine arrays identified hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a potential mediator of stromal-epithelial interaction and antibody neutralization of HGF resulted in reduced expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and decreased glucose uptake by epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Both tumor/epithelial and stromal characteristics play important roles in metabolism. Warburg-like metabolism is influenced by changes in stromal-epithelial interactions, including altered expression of HGF/Met pathway and GLUT1 expression.",,,3,,,

In cross-sectional analyses, linear regression was used to estimate associations of Street Smart Walk Score_ with glucose, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and waist circumference, while logistic regression was used to estimate associations with odds of metabolic syndrome. Econometric fixed effects models were used to estimate longitudinal associations of changes in walkability with changes in each risk factor among participants who moved residential locations between 2004 and 2012 (n=583). Most cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were small and statistically non-significant. We found limited evidence that higher walkability was cross-sectionally associated with lower blood pressure but that increases in walkability were associated with increases in triglycerides and blood pressure over time. Further research over longer time periods is needed to understand the potential for built environment interventions to improve cardiometabolic health. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1802,"Changes in walking, body mass index, and cardiometabolic risk factors following residential relocation: Longitudinal results from the CARDIA study BACKGROUND: While many studies have found the built environment to be associated with walking, most have used cross-sectional research designs and few have examined more distal cardiometabolic outcomes. This study contributes longitudinal evidence based on changes in walking, body mass index (BMI), and cardiometabolic risk following residential relocation. METHODS: We examined 1,079 participants in the CARDIA study who moved residential locations between 2000 and 2006 (ages 32-46 in 2000, 49% white/51% black, 55% female). We created a walkability index from measures of population density, street connectivity, and food and physical activity resources, measured at participants' pre- and post-move residential locations. Outcomes measured before and after the move included walking, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, insulin resistance, triglycerides, cholesterol, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and C-reactive protein. Fixed effects (FE) models were used to estimate associations between within-person change in walkability and within-person change in each outcome. These estimates were compared to those from random effects (RE) models to assess the implications of unmeasured confounding. RESULTS: In FE models, a one-SD increase in walkability was associated with a 0.81 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure [95% CI: (-1.55, -0.07)] and a 7.36 percent increase in C-reactive protein [95% CI: (0.60, 14.57)]. Although several significant associations were observed in the RE models, Hausman tests suggested that these estimates were biased for most outcomes. RE estimates were most commonly biased away from the null or in the opposite direction of effect as the FE estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Greater walkability was associated with lower blood pressure and higher C-reactive protein in FE models, potentially reflecting competing health risks and benefits in dense, walkable environments. RE models tended to overstate or otherwise misrepresent the relationship between walkability and health. Approaches that base estimates on variation between individuals may be subject to bias from unmeasured confounding, such as residential self-selection.",,,3,,,
1803,"Extra-familial social factors and obesity in the Hispanic Community Children's Health Study/Study of Latino Youth Hispanic/Latino youth are disproportionately affected by obesity. However, how social factors outside of the family relate to Hispanic/Latino youth obesity is not well understood. We examined associations of extra-familial social factors with overweight/obesity prevalence, and their variation by sex and age, in 1444 Study of Latino Youth participants [48.6% female; 43.4% children (8-11_years); 56.6% adolescents (12-16_years)], who were offspring of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos participants. Youth self-reported general social support from friends, dietary-, and physical activity (PA)-specific support from peers, and awareness/internalization of thinness ideals. Overweight/obesity was defined as body mass index __85th percentile. Logistic regression models assessed effects of social factors and their interactions with age-group and sex, adjusting for potential confounders. Social support from friends interacted with both age and sex in relation to overweight/obesity. Female children who reported lesser (OR 0.60; 95% CI [0.39, 0.91]) and female adolescents who reported greater (OR 1.35; 95% CI [1.06, 1.74]) social support from friends had higher odds of overweight/obesity. Among males, greater awareness/internalization of thinness ideals related to higher odds of overweight/obesity (OR 2.30; 95% CI [1.59, 3.31]). Awareness/internalization of thinness ideals was not associated with overweight/obesity among females. Dietary and PA-specific peer support did not relate to overweight/obesity.

1804,"Swine influenza virus (H1N2) characterization and transmission in ferrets, chile Phylogenetic analysis of the influenza hemagglutinin gene (HA) has suggested that commercial pigs in Chile harbor unique human seasonal H1-like influenza viruses, but further information, including characterization of these viruses, was unavailable. We isolated influenza virus (H1N2) from a swine in a backyard production farm in Central Chile and demonstrated that the HA gene was identical to that in a previous report. Its HA and neuraminidase genes were most similar to human H1 and N2 viruses from the early 1990s and internal segments were similar to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The virus replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo and transmitted in ferrets by respiratory droplet. Antigenically, it was distinct from other swine viruses.

1805,"Calorie-sweetened beverages and fructose: what have we learned 10 years later BACKGROUND: Sugar-sweetened drinks and the fructose they provide are associated with several health problems. METHODS: Data from the Nielsen Homescan and product content were analysed for sweetener type using the Gladson Nutrition Database. Meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials were used to evaluate outcomes of beverage and fructose intake. RESULTS: Over 70% of all foods contain some amounts of added sugar, and consumption of soft drinks has increased fivefold since 1950. Meta-analyses suggest that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is related to the risk of diabetes, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in adults and in children. Drinking two sugar-sweetened beverages per day for 6 months induced features of the metabolic syndrome and fatty liver. Randomized, controlled trials in children and adults lasting from 6 months to 2 years have shown that lowering the intake of soft drinks reduced weight gain. Genetic factors influence the weight gain when drinking soft drinks. CONCLUSION: Consumption of calorie-sweetened beverages and the fructose they contain has continued to increase and may play a role in the epidemic of obesity, the metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease. Reducing intake of soft drinks is associated with less weight gain and metabolic improvement as well. _ 2013 The Authors.

1806,"Dietary sugar and body weight: have we reached a crisis in the epidemic of obesity and diabetes?: health be damned! Pour on the sugar Sugar-sweetened drinks have been associated with several health problems. In the point narrative as presented below, we provide our opinion and review of the data to date that we need to reconsider consumption of dietary sugar based on the growing concern of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the counterpoint narrative following our contribution, Drs. Kahn and Sievenpiper provide a defense and suggest that dietary sugar is not the culprit. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary surveys along with commercial Homescan data on household purchases were used to understand changes in sugar and fructose consumption. Meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials were used to evaluate outcomes of beverage and fructose intake. About 75% of all foods and beverages contain added sugar in a large array of forms. Consumption of soft drinks has increased fivefold since 1950. Meta-analyses suggest that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is related to the risk of diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Drinking two 16-ounce SSBs per day for 6 months induced features of the metabolic syndrome and fatty liver. Randomized controlled trials in children and adults lasting 6 months to 2 years have shown that lowering the intake of soft drinks reduced weight gain. Recent studies suggest a gene-SSB potential relationship. Consumption of calorie-sweetened beverages has continued to increase and plays a role in the epidemic of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and fatty liver disease. Reducing intake of soft drinks is associated with less weight gain.",,,4,,,
1807,"Pooled Deep Sequencing of Drug Resistance Loci from Plasmodium falciparum Parasites across Ethiopia Although Ethiopia has an overall lower prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum among countries in Africa, the emergence of drug resistance could seriously hinder elimination efforts. Using samples collected from five therapeutic efficacy studies conducted in 2007-11, we evaluated the prevalence of putative drug resistance mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, and kelch13 genes at the time of those studies, as well as the ama1 gene for genetic relatedness using a pooled amplicon deep sequencing approach. Among all sites, the kelch13 gene showed no mutations, whereas the pfcrt CVIET genotype was fixed in all populations. By contrast, the mdr1 gene demonstrated frequencies of resistant genotypes ranging from 10 to 100% at amino acid position 86 and from 0% to 57.8% at amino acid position 1246. Although we observed a low degree of haplotype sharing between sites, we did observe considerable haplotype sharing within sites over time. This suggests that P. falciparum populations in Ethiopia are isolated and able to persist through time.",,,1,,,

1809,"Plasmodium vivax Infections in Duffy-Negative Individuals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Although Plasmodium vivax has been assumed to be absent from sub-Saharan Africa because of the protective mutation conferring the Duffy-negative phenotype, recent evidence has suggested that P. vivax cases are prevalent in these regions. We selected 292 dried blood spots from children who participated in the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to assess for P. vivax infection. Four P. vivax infections were identified by polymerase chain reaction, each in a geographically different survey cluster. Using these as index cases, we tested the remaining 73 samples from the four clusters. With this approach, 10 confirmed cases, three probable cases, and one possible case of P. vivax were identified. Among the 14 P. vivax cases, nine were coinfected with Plasmodium falciparum. All 14 individuals were confirmed to be Duffy-negative by sequencing for the single point mutation in the GATA motif that represses the expression of the Duffy antigen. This finding is consistent with a growing body of literature that suggests that P. vivax can infect Duffy-negative individuals in Africa. Future molecular and sequencing work is needed to understand the relationship of these isolates with other P. vivax samples from Asia and South America and discover variants linked to P. vivax virulence and erythrocyte invasion.",,,1,,,
1810,"Exome Chip Meta-analysis Fine Maps Causal Variants and Elucidates the Genetic Architecture of Rare Coding Variants in Smoking and Alcohol_Use BACKGROUND: Smoking and alcohol use have been associated with common genetic variants in multiple loci. Rare variants within these loci hold promise in the identification of biological mechanisms in substance use. Exome arrays and genotype imputation can now efficiently genotype rare nonsynonymous and loss of function variants. Such variants are expected to have deleterious functional consequences and to contribute to disease risk. METHODS: We analyzed _250,000 rare variants from 16 independent studies genotyped with exome arrays and augmented this dataset with imputed data from the UK Biobank. Associations were tested for five phenotypes: cigarettes per day, pack-years, smoking initiation, age of smoking initiation, and alcoholic drinks per week. We conducted stratified heritability analyses, single-variant tests, and gene-based burden tests of nonsynonymous/loss-of-function coding variants. We performed a novel fine-mapping analysis to winnow the number of putative causal variants within associated loci. RESULTS: Meta-analytic sample sizes ranged from 152,348 to 433,216, depending on the phenotype. Rare coding variation explained 1.1% to 2.2% of phenotypic variance, reflecting 11% to 18% of the total single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of these phenotypes. We identified 171 genome-wide associated loci across all phenotypes. Fine mapping identified putative causal variants with double base-pair resolution at 24 of these loci, and between three and 10 variants for 65 loci. Twenty loci contained rare coding variants in the 95% credible intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Rare coding variation significantly contributes to the heritability of smoking and alcohol use. Fine-mapping genome-wide association study loci identifies specific variants contributing to the biological etiology of substance use behavior. Copyright _ 2018 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

1811,"Children's moderate to vigorous physical activity attending summer day camps INTRODUCTION: National physical activity standards call for all children to accumulate 60 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The contribution of summer day camps toward meeting this benchmark is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to provide estimates of children's MVPA during summer day camps. METHODS: Children (n=1,061, 78% enrollment; mean age, 7.8 years; 46% female; 65% African American; 48% normal weight) from 20 summer day camps wore ActiGraph GT3x+ accelerometers on the wrist during camp hours for up to 4 non-consecutive days over the summer of 2015 (July). Accumulated MVPA at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of the distribution was estimated using random-effects quantile regression. All models were estimated separately for boys and girls and controlled for wear time. Minutes of MVPA were dichotomized to _60 minutes/day of MVPA or < 60 minutes/day to estimate percentage of boys and girls meeting the 60 minutes/day guideline. All data were analyzed in spring 2016. RESULTS: Across the 20 summer day camps, boys (n=569) and girls (n=492) accumulated a median of 96 and 82 minutes/day of MVPA, respectively. The percentage of children meeting 60 minutes/day of MVPA was 80% (range, 41%-94%) for boys and 73% (range, 30%-97%) for girls. CONCLUSIONS: Summer day camps are a setting where a large portion of boys and girls meet daily physical activity guidelines.

1812,"Turn up the healthy eating and activity time (HEAT): Physical activity outcomes from a 4-year non-randomized controlled trial in summer day camps Summer day camps (SDCs) serve over 14 million children in the U.S. and are well-positioned to help children accumulate the guideline of 60_min per day (60_min/d) of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate a multi-component intervention to increase the percentage of children meeting 60_min/d of MVPA. Twenty SDCs serving 3524 children (7.9_yrs., 46.2% girls, 66.1% non-Hispanic Black) participated in a 4-summer non-randomized two-group intervention. Children's accelerometer-derived MVPA was collected using accelerometers worn on the non-dominant wrist. SDCs were assigned to either 2 summers of intervention (n_=_10, no intervention summer 2015, intervention summer 2016 and 2017) or 1 summer of intervention (n_=_10, no intervention summer 2015 and 2016, intervention summer 2017). The final summer (July 2018) was a no intervention follow-up. Multilevel mixed effects regression models estimated changes in percent of children meeting 60_min/d of MVPA. Across all summers and SDCs, children accumulated an average of 89.2_min/day (_22.5) of MVPA. The likelihood of meeting the 60_min/d MVPA guideline was not different during intervention versus baseline summers for boys or girls (p_>_0.05). Girls and boys were 3.5 (95CI_=_1.5, 8.1) and 3.7 (95CI_=_1.6, 8.4) times more likely to meet the 60_min/d guideline during intervention summers versus follow-up, respectively. The intervention was not successful at increasing the percentage of children meeting the 60_min/d MVPA guideline. However, children attending SDCs accumulated substantial amounts of MVPA thus efforts should focus on making SDCs an accessible setting for all children. _ 2020 The Authors.",,,9,,,
1813,"Implementation of ""Treat-all"" at adult HIV care and treatment sites in the Global IeDEA Consortium: results from the Site Assessment Survey INTRODUCTION: Since 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that all people living with HIV (PLHIV) initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART), irrespective of CD4+ count or clinical stage. National adoption of universal treatment has accelerated since WHO's 2015 ""Treat All"" recommendation; however, little is known about the translation of this guidance into practice. This study aimed to assess the status of Treat All implementation across regions, countries, and levels of the health care delivery system. METHODS: Between June and December 2017, 201/221 (91%) adult HIV treatment sites that participate in the global IeDEA research consortium completed a survey on capacity and practices related to HIV care. Located in 41 countries across seven geographic regions, sites provided information on the status and timing of site-level introduction of Treat All, as well as site-level practices related to ART initiation. RESULTS: Almost all sites (93%) reported that they had begun implementing Treat All, and there were no statistically significant differences in site-level Treat All introduction by health facility type, urban/rural location, sector (public/private) or country income level. The median time between national policy adoption and site-level introduction was one month. In countries where Treat All was not yet adopted in national guidelines, 69% of sites reported initiating all patients on ART, regardless of clinical criteria, and these sites had been implementing Treat All for a median period of seven months at the time of the survey. The majority of sites (77%) reported typically initiating patients on ART within 14_days of confirming diagnosis, with 60% to 62% of sites implementing Treat All in East, Southern and West Africa reporting same-day ART initiation for most patients. CONCLUSIONS: By mid- to late-2017, the Treat All strategy was the standard of care at almost all IeDEA sites, including rural, primary-level health facilities in low-resource settings. While further assessments of site-level capacity to provide high-quality HIV care under Treat All and to support sustained viral suppression after ART initiation are needed, the widespread introduction of Treat All at the service delivery level is a critical step towards global targets for ending the HIV epidemic as a public health threat. _ 2019 The Authors.

1814,"Self-disclosure of HIV status, disclosure counseling, and retention in HIV care in Cameroon Poor retention in care is common among HIV-positive adults in sub-Saharan Africa settings and remains a key barrier to HIV management. We quantify the associations of disclosure of HIV status and referral to disclosure counseling with successful retention in care using data from three Cameroon clinics participating in the Phase 1 International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS Central Africa cohort. Of 1646 patients newly initiating antiretroviral therapy between January 2008 and January 2011, 43% were retained in care following treatment initiation. Self-disclosure of HIV status to at least one person prior to treatment initiation was associated with a minimal increase in the likelihood of being retained in care (risk ratio [RR]_=_1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 1.38). However, referral to disclosure counseling was associated with a moderate increase in retention (RR_=_1.37; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.55) and was not significantly modified by prior disclosure status (p_=_.3). Our results suggest that while self-disclosure may not significantly improve retention among patients receiving care at these Cameroon sites, counseling services may play an important role regardless of prior disclosure status.",,,6,,,

1816,"Association of exposure to infections in childhood with risk of eating disorders in adolescent girls Importance: Infections are recognized as playing a critical role in the risk of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior; however, few studies have evaluated the risk of eating disorders. Objective: To evaluate the association of hospitalization for infections and treatment with anti-infective agents with the risk of an eating disorder diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: A nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study of 525_643 girls born from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 2006, and followed up until December 31, 2012, was conducted using individual-level data drawn from Danish longitudinal registers. Data were analyzed from January 15 to June 15, 2018, using survival analysis models and adjusted for age, calendar period, parental educational level, and parental history of psychiatric illness. Exposures: Hospital admission for infections and prescribed anti-infective agents for infections. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome of interest was diagnosis of an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or eating disorder not otherwise specified) in a hospital, outpatient clinic, or emergency department setting. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and accompanying 95% CIs. Results: The study population consisted of 525_643 adolescent girls: 2131 received a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (median [range] age, 15.2 [8.6-21.3] years), 711 received a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa (median [range] age, 17.9 [13.4-22.7] years), and 1398 received a diagnosis of an eating disorder not otherwise specified (median [range] age, 15.6 [8.6-21.6] years). A total of 525_643 adolescent girls were followed up for 4_601_720.4 person-years until a mean age of 16.2 years (range, 10.5-22.7 years). Severe infections that required hospitalization were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent diagnosis of anorexia nervosa by 22% (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10-1.35), bulimia nervosa by 35% (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.60), and eating disorder not otherwise specified by 39% (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.23-1.57) compared with adolescent girls without hospitalizations for infections. Infections treated with anti-infective agents were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent diagnosis of anorexia nervosa by 23% (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.37), bulimia nervosa by 63% (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.32-2.02), and eating disorder not otherwise specified by 45% (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.25-1.67) compared with adolescent girls without infections treated with anti-infective agents. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that hospital-treated infections and less severe infections treated with anti-infective agents are associated with increased risk of subsequent anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorders not otherwise specified and that future studies should investigate whether these associations are causal and identify the exact mechanisms between infections and subsequent inflammatory processes with eating disorders.",,,9,,,
1817,"Comparative effectiveness of mailed reminders with and without fecal immunochemical tests for Medicaid beneficiaries at a large county health department: A randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is effective but underused. Screening rates are lower among Medicaid beneficiaries versus other insured populations. No studies have examined mailed fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)-based outreach programs for Medicaid beneficiaries. METHODS: In a patient-level randomized controlled trial, a mailed CRC screening reminder plus FIT, sent from an urban health department to Medicaid beneficiaries, was compared with the same reminder without FIT. The reminder group could request FIT. Completed FIT kits were processed by the health department laboratory. Respondents were notified of normal results by mail. Abnormal results were given via phone by a patient navigator who provided counselling and assistance with follow-up care. The primary outcome was FIT return. RESULTS: In all, 2144 beneficiaries at average CRC risk were identified, and there was no evidence of screening with Medicaid claims data. To the reminder+FIT group, 1071 were randomized, and 1073 were randomized to the reminder group; 307 (28.7%) in the reminder+FIT group and 347 (32.3%) in the reminder group were unreachable or ineligible (previous screening). The FIT return rate was significantly higher in the reminder+FIT group than the reminder group (21.1% vs 12.3%; difference, 8.8%; 95% confidence interval, 3.7%-13.9%; P_< _.01). Eighteen individuals (7.2%) who completed FIT tests had abnormal results, and 15 were eligible for follow-up colonoscopy; 66.7% (n_=_10) completed follow-up colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: A health department-based, mailed FIT program targeting Medicaid beneficiaries was feasible. Including a FIT kit resulted in greater screening completion than a reminder letter alone. Further research is needed to understand the comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions. _ 2018 American Cancer Society.",,,5,,,
1818,"Validation of Multiplex Serology detecting human herpesviruses 1-5 Human herpesviruses (HHV) cause a variety of clinically relevant conditions upon primary infection of typically young and immunocompetent hosts. Both primary infection and reactivation after latency can lead to more severe disease, such as encephalitis, congenital defects and cancer. Infections with HHV are also associated with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. However, most of the associations are based on retrospective case-control analyses and well-powered prospective cohort studies are needed for assessing temporality and causality. To enable comprehensive investigations of HHV-related disease etiology in large prospective population-based cohort studies, we developed HHV Multiplex Serology. This methodology represents a low-cost, high-throughput technology that allows simultaneous measurement of specific antibodies against five HHV species: Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Cytomegalovirus. The newly developed HHV species-specific ('Monoplex') assays were validated against established gold-standard reference assays. The specificity and sensitivity of the HHV species-specific Monoplex Serology assays ranged from 92.3% to 100.0% (median 97.4%) and 91.8% to 98.7% (median 96.6%), respectively. Concordance with reference assays was very high with kappa values ranging from 0.86 to 0.96 (median kappa 0.93). Multiplexing the Monoplex Serology assays resulted in no loss of performance and allows simultaneous detection of antibodies against the 5 HHV species in a high-throughput manner.",,,8,,,
1819,"Mental health service use among adolescents following participation in a randomized clinical trial for depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disorder among adolescents. The Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) was a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of fluoxetine and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), separately and together, compared with placebo, in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. The Survey of Outcomes Following Treatment for Adolescent Depression (SOFTAD) was designed as a naturalistic follow-up of participants in TADS. The aims of the current analyses are to describe mental health service use during the SOFTAD period. There were 196 adolescents recruited from 12 TADS sites. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age-Children-Present and Lifetime Version was used for clinical diagnoses. Participants completed a psychiatric treatment log and the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment to assess service use. 58% received psychotherapy or nonstimulant psychotropic medication during SOFTAD. Youth with recurrent MDD had higher rates of treatment compared to youth without recurrent MDD (71% vs. 45%). However, nearly one third of the adolescents in the study did not receive treatment for a recurrent episode of depression. Service use differed by gender for those with recurrent MDD, with female participants (79%) receiving treatment at higher rates than male participants (55%), although there was no significant difference in depression severity between genders. Younger participants with recurrent MDD had higher odds of receiving psychotherapy. Use of psychotherapy and psychotropics following recurrence of depression appears to be influenced by age and gender. Even when youth respond well to treatment, a sizeable percentage are likely to experience a subsequent episode that may go untreated.",,,1,,,
1820,"Women and HIV in the united states BACKGROUND: The demographic and geographic characteristics of the HIV epidemic in the US has changed substantially since the disease emerged, with women in the South experiencing a particularly high HIV incidence. In this study, we identified and described counties in the US in which the prevalence of HIV is particularly high in women compared to men. METHODS: Using data from AIDSVu, a public dataset of HIV cases in the US in 2012, we categorized counties by their decile of the ratio of female to male HIV prevalence. The demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of counties in the highest decile were compared to those of counties in the lower deciles. RESULTS: Most of the counties in the highest decile were located in the Deep South. These counties had a lower median income, higher percentage of people in poverty, and lower percentage of people with a high school education. Additionally, people with HIV in these counties were more likely to be non-Hispanic black. CONCLUSIONS: Counties with the highest ratios of female-to-male HIV prevalence are concentrated in the Southern US, and residents of these counties tend to be of lower socioeconomic status. Identifying and describing these counties is important for developing public health interventions.",,,6,,,
1821,"S100 proteins in cancer In humans, the S100 protein family is composed of 21 members that exhibit a high degree of structural similarity, but are not functionally interchangeable. This family of proteins modulates cellular responses by functioning both as intracellular Ca(2+) sensors and as extracellular factors. Dysregulated expression of multiple members of the S100 family is a common feature of human cancers, with each type of cancer showing a unique S100 protein profile or signature. Emerging in vivo evidence indicates that the biology of most S100 proteins is complex and multifactorial, and that these proteins actively contribute to tumorigenic processes such as cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis and immune evasion. Drug discovery efforts have identified leads for inhibiting several S100 family members, and two of the identified inhibitors have progressed to clinical trials in patients with cancer. This Review highlights new findings regarding the role of S100 family members in cancer diagnosis and treatment, the contribution of S100 signalling to tumour biology, and the discovery and development of S100 inhibitors for treating cancer.",,,3,,,
1822,"Genetic variants identified in a European genome-wide association study that were found to predict incident coronary heart disease in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study In 2007, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) performed a genome-wide association study in 2,000 British coronary heart disease (CHD) cases and 3,000 controls after genotyping 469,557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Seven variants associated with CHD were initially identified, and 5 SNPs were later found in replication studies. In the current study, the authors aimed to determine whether the 12 SNPs reported by the WTCCC predicted incident CHD through 2004 in a biracial, prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) comprising 15,792 persons aged 45-64 years who had been selected by probability sampling from 4 different US communities in 1987-1989. Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age and gender were used to estimate CHD hazard rate ratios (HRRs) over a 17-year period (1,362 cases in whites and 397 cases in African Americans) under an additive genetic model. The results showed that 3 SNPs in whites (rs599839, rs1333049, and rs501120; HRRs were 1.10 (P = 0.044), 1.14 (P < 0.001), and 1.14 (P = 0.030), respectively) and 1 SNP in African Americans (rs7250581; HRR = 1.60, P = 0.05) were significantly associated with incident CHD. This study demonstrates that genetic variants revealed in a case-control genome-wide association study enriched for early disease onset may play a role in the genetic etiology of CHD in the general population.",,,8,,,
1823,"Fat mass and obesity gene and cognitive decline: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 4 genetic variants in the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) identified in genome-wide association studies of diabetes and obesity are associated with cognitive change in midlife in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS: ARIC is a prospective cohort study of the development of atherosclerosis in 15,792 individuals aged 45 to 64 years at baseline from 1986 to 1989. FTO is highly expressed in human fetal and adult brain, and a single nucleotide polymorphism in FTO has previously been associated with reduced brain volume in cognitively normal subjects. Since a relationship between brain atrophy and diminished cognitive function has been demonstrated in ARIC participants, general linear models were used to evaluate the association between 6-year change in scores on 3 neuropsychological tests and FTO genotype. RESULTS: In a sample of 8,364 white and 2,083 African American men and women with no clinical history of stroke, significantly greater mean change in performance on the Delayed Word Recall Test was associated with 2 of 4 FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms examined (rs9939609, rs805136, rs17817449, and rs1421085) in whites but not in African Americans (p _ 0.002). The association of the FTO polymorphisms with cognitive change was independent of potential confounding clinical and demographic variables including age, gender, education, diabetes, hypertension, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies will be needed to clarify the biological mechanisms and genetic pathways through which variants in FTO can increase susceptibility to decline in verbal memory detectable in middle-aged, community-dwelling adults.",,,8,,,
1824,"Sequence variation in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) as a determinant of risk of cardiovascular disease: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study BACKGROUND: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) maintains telomere ends during DNA replication by catalyzing the addition of short telomere repeats. The expression of telomerase is normally repressed in somatic cells leading to a gradual shortening of telomeres and cellular senescence with aging. Interindividual variation in leukocyte telomere length has been previously associated with susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to determine whether six variants in the TERT gene are associated with risk of incident coronary heart disease, incident ischemic stroke, and mortality in participants in the biracial population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, including rs2736100 that was found to influence mean telomere length in a genome-wide analysis. METHODS: ARIC is a prospective study of the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis in 15,792 individuals aged 45 to 64 years at baseline in 1987-1989. Haplotype tagging SNPs in TERT were genotyped using a custom array containing nearly 49,000 SNPs in 2,100 genes associated with cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between the TERT polymorphisms and incident cardiovascular disease and mortality over a 20-year follow-up period in 8,907 whites and 3,022 African-Americans with no history of disease at the baseline examination, while individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease were not excluded from the analyses of mortality. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and gender, and assuming an additive genetic model, rs2736122 and rs2853668 were nominally associated with incident coronary heart disease (hazards rate ratio_=_1.20, p_=_0.02, 95 % confidence interval_=_1.03- 1.40) and stroke (hazards rate ratio_=_1.17, p_=_0.05, 95 % confidence interval_=_1.00 - 1.38), respectively, in African-Americans. None of the variants was significantly associated with cardiovascular disease in white study participants or with mortality in either racial group. CONCLUSIONS: Replication in additional population-based samples combined with genotyping of polymorphisms in other genes involved in maintenance of telomere length may help to determine whether genetic variants associated with telomere homeostasis influence the risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged adults.",,,8,,,
1825,"Incident heart failure and cognitive decline: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is found in a significant proportion of patients with heart failure (HF). Although cognitive impairment may be a consequence of HF, early signs of cognitive impairment may also indicate subclinical vascular disease, and thus a risk factor for future cardiovascular events. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study is a prospective cohort study of the development of atherosclerosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between mean 6-year change in cognitive function and incident HF in 7962 white and 1933 African-American men and women aged 46 to 70 years and free of clinical stroke. Scores were obtained for the Delayed Word Recall Test, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and the Word Fluency Test. There was a significantly increased risk of developing HF during the mean 12.6-year follow-up period after adjustment for age, gender, race, and education for those in the quartile with the greatest decline in DSST scores (hazard ratio [HR]_=_1.17, P_=_.009), and in the quartile with the lowest baseline DSST scores (HR_=_1.43, P_< _.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that relatively low performance on a test of information processing speed may serve as an indicator of HF risk in middle age. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier Inc.

1826,"Polymorphisms in base excision repair genes as colorectal cancer risk factors and modifiers of the effect of diets high in red meat BACKGROUND: A diet high in red meat is an established colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factor. Carcinogens generated during meat cooking have been implicated as causal agents and can induce oxidative DNA damage, which elicits repair by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. METHODS: Using a family-based study, we investigated the role of polymorphisms in 4 BER genes (APEX1 Gln51His, Asp148Glu; OGG1 Ser236Cys; PARP Val742Ala; and XRCC1 Arg194Trp, Arg280His, Arg399Gln) as potential CRC risk factors and modifiers of the association between diets high in red meat or poultry and CRC risk. We tested for gene-environment interactions using case-only analyses (n = 577) and compared statistically significant results with those obtained using case-unaffected sibling comparisons (n = 307 sibships). RESULTS: Carriers of the APEX1 codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.03-0.69, P = 0.015). The association between higher red meat intake (>3 servings per week) and CRC was modified by the PARP Val762Ala single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; case-only interaction P = 0.026). This SNP also modified the association between higher intake of high-temperature cooked red meat (case-only interaction P = 0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: We report evidence that the BER pathway PARP gene modifies the association of diets high in red meat cooked at high temperatures with risk of CRC. IMPACT: Our findings suggest a contribution to colorectal carcinogenesis of free radical damage as one of the possible harmful effects of a diet high in red meat. _2010 AACR.",,,3,,,

1829,"Increasing vaccination: putting psychological science into action Vaccination is one of the great achievements of the 20th century, yet persistent public-health problems include inadequate, delayed, and unstable vaccination uptake. Psychology offers three general propositions for understanding and intervening to increase uptake where vaccines are available and affordable. The first proposition is that thoughts and feelings can motivate getting vaccinated. Hundreds of studies have shown that risk beliefs and anticipated regret about infectious disease correlate reliably with getting vaccinated; low confidence in vaccine effectiveness and concern about safety correlate reliably with not getting vaccinated. We were surprised to find that few randomized trials have successfully changed what people think and feel about vaccines, and those few that succeeded were minimally effective in increasing uptake. The second proposition is that social processes can motivate getting vaccinated. Substantial research has shown that social norms are associated with vaccination, but few interventions examined whether normative messages increase vaccination uptake. Many experimental studies have relied on hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate that altruism and free riding (i.e., taking advantage of the protection provided by others) can affect intended behavior, but few randomized trials have tested strategies to change social processes to increase vaccination uptake. The third proposition is that interventions can facilitate vaccination directly by leveraging, but not trying to change, what people think and feel. These interventions are by far the most plentiful and effective in the literature. To increase vaccine uptake, these interventions build on existing favorable intentions by facilitating action (through reminders, prompts, and primes) and reducing barriers (through logistics and healthy defaults); these interventions also shape behavior (through incentives, sanctions, and requirements). Although identification of principles for changing thoughts and feelings to motivate vaccination is a work in progress, psychological principles can now inform the design of systems and policies to directly facilitate action.",,,0,,,
1830,"Pharmacist authority to provide HPV vaccine: novel partners in cervical cancer prevention OBJECTIVES: While the provision of cervical cancer prevention services in the United States has expanded to new settings beyond clinics that give Pap smears, prevention efforts are being hampered by relatively low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage. Pharmacies are an underused setting to deliver HPV vaccine. To better understand this opportunity, we sought to classify pharmacists' authority to administer HPV vaccine in each US state. METHODS: For each US state and the District of Columbia (for simplicity, we refer to these 51 regions as states), we interviewed a member of the state's pharmacy association, member of the state board of pharmacy, or a faculty member at a school or college of pharmacy. RESULTS: Most states (80%) allowed pharmacists to provide HPV vaccine to adult women ages 19 and older, and 61% of states allowed provision to girls age 12. The mechanism for pharmacists to immunize was highly variable across states. For example, a 12 year-old girl seeking HPV vaccine could receive it from a pharmacist in 31% of states under a protocol between a specific physician and pharmacist, in 24% with an HPV vaccine prescription, and in 6% without prior physician approval. Pharmacists' authority was broadest on the west coast and limited on the east coast. Pharmacist authority to provide HPV, Tdap, and meningitis vaccines was very similar, but it was highly dependent on patient age. CONCLUSIONS: US states' laws governing pharmacists' ability to offer HPV vaccine varied widely. One consequence is that newly expanded cervical prevention efforts underuse pharmacists.

1831,"Patients' understanding of how genotype variation affects benefits of tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer BACKGROUND: CYP2D6 is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of tamoxifen and potentially a key determinant in breast cancer outcomes. Our study examined patients' beliefs about how the CYP2D6 genotype would affect their prognoses. METHODS: Women enrolled in a pharmacogenomic clinical trial and on tamoxifen for prevention or treatment of breast cancer underwent CYP2D6 genotyping (EM = extensive, IM = intermediate, PM = poor metabolizing alleles). The informed consent said that the purpose of the trial was to examine effects of dose adjustment based on genotype, but that clinical benefits were uncertain. Our embedded sub-study surveyed 320 patients prior to receiving their genotypes. We experimentally manipulated 6 vignettes to describe hypothetical tamoxifen treatment (no or yes) and hypothetical genotype (EM, IM or PM). For each vignette, women gave their perceived recurrence risk (RR; 0-100%). RESULTS: Women believed that genotype would not affect their RR if they did not take tamoxifen (p = 0.06). However, women believed that if prescribed tamoxifen, genotype would affect their RR (22% if EM, 30% if IM and 40% if PM, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Women believed that extensive tamoxifen metabolizers had better prognoses, despite study materials stating uncertainty about any benefit. The rapidly changing nature of genomic science calls for caution when communicating clinical utility.",,,3,,,
1832,"Anticipated regret and health behavior: A meta-analysis OBJECTIVE: Risk beliefs are central to most theories of health behavior, yet many unanswered questions remain about an increasingly studied risk construct, anticipated regret. The authors sought to better understand anticipated regret's role in motivating health behaviors. METHOD: The authors systematically searched electronic databases for studies of anticipated regret and behavioral intentions or health behavior. They used random effects meta-analysis to synthesize effect sizes from 81 studies (n = 45,618). RESULTS: Anticipated regret was associated with both intentions (r+ = .50, p < .001) and health behavior (r+ = .29, p < .001). Greater anticipated regret from engaging in a behavior (i.e., action regret) predicted weaker intentions and behavior, whereas greater anticipated regret from not engaging in a behavior (i.e., inaction regret) predicted stronger intentions and behavior. Anticipated action regret had smaller associations with behavioral intentions related to less severe and more distal hazards, but these moderation findings were not present for inaction regret. Anticipated regret generally was a stronger predictor of intentions and behavior than other anticipated negative emotions and risk appraisals. CONCLUSIONS: Anticipated inaction regret has a stronger and more stable association with health behavior than previously thought. The field should give greater attention to understanding how anticipated regret differs from similar constructs, its role in health behavior theory, and its potential use in health behavior interventions.

1834,"Longitudinal predictors of human papillomavirus vaccine initiation among adolescent girls in a high-risk geographic area BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake is low among adolescent girls in the United States. We sought to identify longitudinal predictors of HPV vaccine initiation in populations at elevated risk for cervical cancer. METHODS: We interviewed a population-based sample of parents of 10- to 18-year-old girls in areas of North Carolina with elevated cervical cancer rates. Baseline interviews occurred in summer 2007 and follow-up interviews in fall 2008. Measures included health belief model constructs. RESULTS: Parents reported that 27% (149/567) of their daughters had initiated HPV vaccine between baseline and follow-up. Of parents who at baseline intended to get their daughters the vaccine in the next year, only 38% (126/348) had done so by follow-up. Of parents of daughters who remained unvaccinated at follow-up but had seen a doctor since baseline, only 37% (122/388) received an HPV vaccine recommendation. Rates of HPV vaccine initiation were higher among parents who at baseline perceived lower barriers to getting HPV vaccine, anticipated greater regret if their daughters got HPV because they were unvaccinated, did not report ""needing more information"" as the main reason they had not already vaccinated, intended to get their daughters the vaccine, or were not born-again Christians. CONCLUSIONS: Missed opportunities to increase HPV vaccine uptake included unrealized parent intentions and absent doctor recommendations. While several health belief model constructs identified in early acceptability studies (e.g., perceived risk, perceived vaccine effectiveness) were not longitudinally associated with HPV vaccine initiation, our findings suggest correlates of uptake (e.g., anticipated regret) that offer novel opportunities for intervention.",,,0,,,
1835,"Announcements versus conversations to improve HPV vaccination coverage: A randomized trial OBJECTIVE: Improving provider recommendations is critical to addressing low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage. Thus, we sought to determine the effectiveness of training providers to improve their recommendations using either presumptive ""announcements"" or participatory ""conversations."" METHODS: In 2015, we conducted a parallel-group randomized clinical trial with 30 pediatric and family medicine clinics in central North Carolina. We randomized clinics to receive no training (control), announcement training, or conversation training. Announcements are brief statements that assume parents are ready to vaccinate, whereas conversations engage parents in open-ended discussions. A physician led the 1-hour, in-clinic training. The North Carolina Immunization Registry provided data on the primary trial outcome: 6-month coverage change in HPV vaccine initiation (_1 dose) for adolescents aged 11 or 12 years. RESULTS: The immunization registry attributed 17_173 adolescents aged 11 or 12 to the 29 clinics still open at 6-months posttraining. Six-month increases in HPV vaccination coverage were larger for patients in clinics that received announcement training versus those in control clinics (5.4% difference, 95% confidence interval: 1.1%-9.7%). Stratified analyses showed increases for both girls (4.6% difference) and boys (6.2% difference). Patients in clinics receiving conversation training did not differ from those in control clinics with respect to changes in HPV vaccination coverage. Neither training was effective for changing coverage for other vaccination outcomes or for adolescents aged 13 through 17 (n = 37_796). CONCLUSIONS: Training providers to use announcements resulted in a clinically meaningful increase in HPV vaccine initiation among young adolescents.

1836,"Testing warning messages on smokers' cigarette packages: a standardised protocol PURPOSE: Lab experiments on cigarette warnings typically use a brief one-time exposure that is not paired with the cigarette packs smokers use every day, leaving open the question of how repeated warning exposure over several weeks may affect smokers. This proof of principle study sought to develop a new protocol for testing cigarette warnings that better reflects real-world exposure by presenting them on cigarette smokers' own packs. METHODS: We tested a cigarette pack labelling protocol with 76 US smokers ages 18 and older. We applied graphic warnings to the front and back of smokers' cigarette packs. RESULTS: Most smokers reported that at least 75% of the packs of cigarettes they smoked during the study had our warnings. Nearly all said they would participate in the study again. Using cigarette packs with the study warnings increased quit intentions (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a feasible pack labelling protocol with six steps: (1) schedule appointments at brief intervals; (2) determine typical cigarette consumption; (3) ask smokers to bring a supply of cigarette packs to study appointments; (4) apply labels to smokers' cigarette packs; (5) provide participation incentives at the end of appointments; and (6) refer smokers to cessation services at end of the study. When used in randomised controlled trials in settings with real-world message exposure over time, this protocol may help identify the true impact of warnings and thus better inform tobacco product labelling policy.

1837,"Cigarette pack messages about toxic chemicals: a randomised clinical trial BACKGROUND: The USA can require tobacco companies to disclose information about harmful and potentially harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke, but the impact of these messages is uncertain. We sought to assess the effect of placing messages about toxic chemicals on smokers' cigarette packs. METHODS: Participants were 719 adult cigarette smokers from California, USA, recruited from September 2016 through March 2017. We randomly assigned smokers to receive either factual messages about chemicals in cigarette smoke and their health harms (intervention) or messages about not littering cigarette butts (control) on the side of their cigarette packs for 3 weeks. The primary trial outcome was intention to quit smoking. RESULTS: In intent-to-treat analyses, smokers whose packs had chemical messages did not have higher intentions to quit smoking at the end of the trial than those whose packs had control messages (P=0.56). Compared with control messages, chemical messages led to higher awareness of the chemicals (28% vs 15%, P< 0.001) and health harms (60% vs 52%, P=0.02) featured in the messages. In addition, chemical messages led to greater negative affect, thinking about the chemicals in cigarettes and the harms of smoking, conversations about the messages and forgoing a cigarette (all P< 0.05). DISCUSSION: Chemical messages on cigarette packs did not lead to higher intentions to quit among smokers in our trial. However, chemical messages informed smokers of chemicals in cigarettes and harms of smoking, which directly supports their implementation and would be critical to defending the messages against cigarette company legal challenges.

1838,"Public understanding of cigarette smoke constituents: three US surveys INTRODUCTION: The Tobacco Control Act requires public disclosure of information about toxic constituents in cigarette smoke. To inform these efforts, we studied public understanding of cigarette smoke constituents. METHODS: We conducted phone surveys with national probability samples of adolescents (n=1125) and adults (n=5014) and an internet survey with a convenience sample of adults (n=4137), all in the USA. We assessed understanding of cigarette smoke constituents in general and of 24 specific constituents. RESULTS: Respondents commonly and incorrectly believed that harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke mostly originate in additives introduced by cigarette manufacturers (43-72%). Almost all participants had heard that nicotine is in cigarette smoke, and many had also heard about carbon monoxide, ammonia, arsenic and formaldehyde. Less than one-quarter had heard of most other listed constituents being in cigarette smoke. Constituents most likely to discourage respondents from wanting to smoke were ammonia, arsenic, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead and uranium. Respondents more often reported being discouraged by constituents that they had heard are in cigarette smoke (all p< 0.05). Constituents with names that started with a number or ended in 'ene' or 'ine' were less likely to discourage people from wanting to smoke (all p< 0.05). DISCUSSION: Many people were unaware that burning the cigarette is the primary source of toxic constituents in cigarette smoke. Constituents that may most discourage cigarette smoking have familiar names, like arsenic and formaldehyde and do not start with a number or end in ene/ine. Our findings may help campaign designers develop constituent messages that discourage smoking. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

1839,"Understanding why pictorial cigarette pack warnings increase quit attempts BACKGROUND: Our randomized trial found that pictorial cigarette pack warnings elicited more quit attempts than text-only warnings. PURPOSE: In the current study, we sought to identify psychological mechanisms that explain why pictorial cigarette pack warnings change behavior. METHODS: In 2014 and 2015, we recruited 2,149 adult smokers in NC and CA, USA. We randomly assigned smokers to receive on their cigarette packs for 4 weeks either a text-only warning (one of the USA's current warnings on the side of cigarette packs) or a pictorial warning (one of the USA's proposed text warnings with pictures on the top half of the front and back of cigarette packs). RESULTS: Pictorial warnings increased attention to, reactions to, and social interactions about cigarette pack warnings (all p < .05). However, pictorial warnings changed almost no belief or attitude measures. Mediators of the impact of pictorial warnings included increased attention, negative affect, social interactions, thinking about the warning and harms of smoking, and intentions to quit (all p < .05). Analyses also found that pictorial warnings led to greater avoidance of the warnings, which was associated with more quit attempts (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Pictorial warnings increased quit attempts by eliciting aversive reactions and by keeping the message vividly in smokers' minds. Contrary to predictions from several theories of health behavior, the warnings exerted little of their influence through changes in beliefs and attitudes and none of their influence through changes in risk perception. We propose the Tobacco Warnings Model based on these findings.

1840,"Improving communication of breast cancer recurrence risk Doctors commonly use genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk. We sought to assess whether the standard genomic report provided to doctors is a good approach for communicating results to patients. During 2009-2010, we interviewed 133 patients with stages I or II, node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and eligible for the Oncotype DX genomic test. In a randomized experiment, patients viewed six vignettes that presented hypothetical recurrence risk test results. Each vignette described a low, intermediate, or high chance of breast cancer recurrence in 10 years. Vignettes used one of five risk formats of increasing complexity that we derived from the standard report that accompanies the commercial assay or a sixth format that used an icon array. Among women who received the genomic recurrence risk test, 63% said their doctors showed them the standard report. The standard report format yielded among the most errors in identification of whether a result was low, intermediate, or high risk (i.e., the gist of the results), whereas a newly developed risk continuum format yielded the fewest errors (17% vs. 5%; OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.10-0.52). For high recurrence risk results presented in the standard format, women made errors 35% of the time. Women rated the standard report as one of the least understandable and least-liked formats, but they rated the risk continuum format as among the most understandable and most liked. Results differed little by health literacy, numeracy, prior receipt of genomic test results during clinical care, and actual genomic test results. The standard genomic recurrence risk report was more difficult for women to understand and interpret than the other formats. A less complex report, potentially including the risk continuum format, would be more effective in communicating test results to patients.",,,3,,,
1841,"Effect of Dial-Out Prefix Change on 9-1-1 Calls at a Large State University BACKGROUND: Accessing the emergency medical services system via 9-1-1 operators is an effective way for patients to seek urgent health care; however, technological advances and telecommunication practices inundate the 9-1-1 and emergency services infrastructure with unintentional calls that delay response efforts to legitimate medical emergencies. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the change in university-wide dial-out prefix from ""9"" to ""7"" reduced unnecessary calls to a 9-1-1 call center. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted utilizing information obtained from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Department of Public Safety (DPS) call center. Call center calls received during pre-change, intervening, and post-change periods were included in the study. The cost savings, defined in time and money, resulting from the prefix change were also examined. RESULTS: A total of 33,646 calls were made during the study period (January 11, 2010 through December 31, 2012) and included in the analysis. The prefix change was found to reduce the rate of invalid calls to the call center by 319 calls per month, resulting in a 43% reduction in total calls to the call center while preserving the rate of valid calls. The largest decrease occurred in hang-up calls (a decrease of 232 calls per month), especially those originating from the university. The prefix change was found to save the UNC DPS telecommunications division approximately $798.82 per month and the police officer division approximately $3,874.95 per month. CONCLUSION: A prefix change was not only beneficial to the UNC community but it also has potentially wide-reaching effects. A reduction of invalid 9-1-1 calls translates to telecommunicators having more time available to handle true emergencies, phone lines remaining available for true emergencies, and police officers dedicating more time and effort to matters that necessitate officer assistance. Based on the call decrease seen with the prefix change, this study may be used as evidence to advocate for a change of dial-out codes beginning with ""9.""",,,1,,,
1842,"Evaluation of the implementation of the trauma triage and destination plan on the field triage of injured patients in north carolina OBJECTIVE: Timely triage and appropriate destination decision making for injured patients are central challenges faced by emergency medical services (EMS) systems. In 2010, North Carolina (NC) adopted a statewide Trauma Triage and Destination Plan (TTDP) based on the CDC's Field Triage Guidelines to better address these challenges. We sought to characterize the implementation of these guidelines by quantifying their effect on multiple metrics of patient care. METHODS: We employed a retrospective pre-post study design utilizing a statewide EMS medical record database. We assessed several metrics of patient care-including changes in destination choice, appropriateness of EMS destination, transit time to first hospital, transit time to definitive care, and others-in a six-month period in the year before and after the implementation of the guidelines. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 190,307 EMS encounters pre- (n = 93,927) and post-implementation (n = 96,380). Among all patients, there was not a significant difference in the percentage transported to a community hospital or Level I, II, or III trauma center as their first destination. Among those patients meeting TTDP guidelines for transport to a trauma center, the number transported to a Level I or II trauma center decreased 1.0% from 30.6% (n = 2,911) to 29.6% (n = 2,954) (95% CI: -0.2%, 2.2%). Those transported to a Level I trauma center decreased 0.4% from 21.2% to 20.8% in the post-period (95% CI: -0.7%, 1.5%). There were also no significant changes in EMS scene times (14.0 pre-, 14.1 post-) and transport times (12.9 pre-, 13.0 post-). While scene distance from a Level I trauma center showed a decreased likelihood of transport to that center, there was an overall post-implementation increase of 2.5% from 18.0% to 20.5% (95% CI: -3.6%, -1.3%) in transport to a Level I trauma center among patients meeting anatomic criteria across all distance ranges. CONCLUSIONS: We found that implementation of region-specific destination plans based on the Field Triage Guidelines had little effect on selected hospital destination, scene times, transport times, and other metrics of EMS decision making and effectiveness. We suspect this is due to delays in information dissemination and adoption by field providers.",,,9,,,
1843,"Radiographic severity of rheumatoid arthritis in African Americans: results from a multicenter observational study OBJECTIVE: To describe radiographic changes in African Americans with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluations of African Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) Registry, a multicenter observational study. METHODS: Self-declared African American patients were enrolled in CLEAR I, a longitudinal cohort of early RA (disease duration of < 2 years) from 2000 to 2005, or in CLEAR II, a cross-sectional cohort (any disease duration) from 2006 to the present. Demographic and clinical data were obtained, and sets of hand/wrist and foot radiographs were scored using the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scoring system. RESULTS: A total of 357 and 418 patients were enrolled in CLEAR I and CLEAR II, respectively. We report here an interim analysis of radiographic severity in these patients. For the CLEAR I cohort, 294 patients had a mean radiographic score of 2.89 at the baseline visit; 32.0% showed either erosions (25.9%) or joint space narrowing (JSN; 19.4%). At the 36-month visit, the mean score was 5.65; 44.2% had erosions, 41.5% had JSN, and 54.4% had either. Among those patients without radiographic damage at baseline, 18.9% had progressed at the 36-month visit, compared with 57.1% of those with baseline damage (P < 0.0001). For the CLEAR II cohort, of 167 patients with RA of any duration, 65.3% exhibited joint erosions, 65.3% exhibited JSN, and 74.8% exhibited either. The mean radiographic score was 33.42. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest radiographic study of African American RA patients. Damage occurs early in the disease and is associated with radiographic progression at 3 years of disease duration. The CLEAR Registry will provide a valuable resource for future analyses of genetic, clinical, and environmental factors associated with radiographic severity of RA in African Americans.",,,3,,,

1845,A Microbiomic Analysis in African Americans with Colonic Lesions Reveals Streptococcus sp.VT162 as a Marker of Neoplastic Transformation Increasing evidence suggests a role of the gut microbiota in colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC). To detect bacterial markers of colorectal cancer in African Americans a metabolomic analysis was performed on fecal water extracts. DNA from stool samples of adenoma and healthy subjects and from colon cancer and matched normal tissues was analyzed to determine the microbiota composition (using 16S rDNA) and genomic content (metagenomics). Metagenomic functions with discriminative power between healthy and neoplastic specimens were established. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR) using primers and probes specific to Streptococcus sp. VT_162 were used to validate this bacterium association with neoplastic transformation in stool samples from two independent cohorts of African Americans and Chinese patients with colorectal lesions. The metabolomic analysis of adenomas revealed low amino acids content. The microbiota in both cancer vs. normal tissues and adenoma vs. normal stool samples were different at the 16S rRNA gene level. Cross-mapping of metagenomic data led to 9 markers with significant discriminative power between normal and diseased specimens. These markers identified with Streptococcus sp. VT_162. Q-PCR data showed a statistically significant presence of this bacterium in advanced adenoma and cancer samples in an independent cohort of CRC patients. We defined metagenomic functions from Streptococcus sp. VT_162 with discriminative power among cancers vs. matched normal and adenomas vs. healthy subjects' stools. Streptococcus sp. VT_162 specific 16S rDNA was validated in an independent cohort. These findings might facilitate non-invasive screening for colorectal cancer.,,,3,,,
1846,"Association of restrictive housing during incarceration with mortality after release Importance: Restrictive housing, otherwise known as solitary confinement, during incarceration is associated with poor health outcomes. Objective: To characterize the association of restrictive housing with reincarceration and mortality after release. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 229_274 individuals who were incarcerated and released from the North Carolina prison system from January 2000 to December 2015. Incarceration data were matched with death records from January 2000 to December 2016. Covariates included age, number of prior incarcerations, type of conviction, mental health treatment recommended or received, number of days served in the most recent sentence, sex, and race. Data analysis was conducted from August 2018 to May 2019. Exposures: Restrictive housing during incarceration. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality (all-cause, opioid overdose, homicide, and suicide) and reincarceration. Results: From 2000 to 2015, 229_274 people (197_656 [86.2%] men; 92_677 [40.4%] white individuals; median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 32 years [26-42]), were released 398_158 times from the state prison system in North Carolina. Those who spent time in restrictive housing had a median (IQR) age of 30 (24-38) years and a median (IQR) sentence length of 382 (180-1010) days; 84_272 (90.3%) were men, and 59_482 (63.7%) were nonwhite individuals. During 130_551 of 387_913 incarcerations (33.7%) people were placed in restrictive housing. Compared with individuals who were incarcerated and not placed in restrictive housing, those who spent any time in restrictive housing were more likely to die in the first year after release (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% CI 1.12-1.38), especially from suicide (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.19-2.67) and homicide (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.24-1.91). They were also more likely to die of an opioid overdose in the first 2 weeks after release (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.16-4.43) and to become reincarcerated (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.99-2.34). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that exposure to restrictive housing is associated with an increased risk of death during community reentry. These findings are important in the context of ongoing debates about the harms of restrictive housing, indicating a need to find alternatives to its use and flagging restrictive housing as an important risk factor during community reentry.",,,3,,,
1847,"Methodology to integrate complex-systems thinking and multi-criteria decision analysis in health-oriented planning and application to a health-care example Numerous empirical studies support the notion that urban built environments function as determinants of health, and society increasingly demands that urban planning and building positively impact community health outcomes. As behaviorally associated chronic diseases have become leading causes of morbidity and mortality, methodology is needed to support planners in their consideration of and contribution toward population health goals. Community health is best conceptualized as a complex system of interrelationships between economic, environmental, and social structures. This paper presents an approach that uses complex-systems thinking to identify drivers of community health in the context of planning possibilities. It then uses multi-criteria decision analysis from the field of operations research to support informed decision making that explicitly engages multiple and potentially conflicting stakeholder perspectives and objectives, including those of community members. As an illustration, the approach is applied to a health-care campus planning decision in an urban community long beset by disproportionately high rates of obesity and chronic disease. In this particular case, the results of the analyses included differing rankings of decision alternatives from the perspectives of the community and the decision-making organization, although there was alignment on most and least preferred choices. Results could differ in other project and community contexts, but the methodology provides insights on decision alternatives that can strengthen sound healthoriented decision making for urban planning and building projects. _ Copyright 2017, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc.

1848,"Impacts of active school design on school-time sedentary behavior and physical activity: a pilot natural experiment BACKGROUND: Children spend a significant portion of their days in sedentary behavior (SB) and on average fail to engage in adequate physical activity (PA). The school built environment may influence SB and PA, but research is limited. This natural experiment evaluated whether an elementary school designed to promote movement impacted students' school-time SB and PA. METHODS: Accelerometers measured SB and PA at pre and post time-points in an intervention group who moved to the new school (n = 21) and in a comparison group experiencing no school environmental change (n = 20). Difference-in-difference (DD) analysis examined SB and PA outcomes in these groups. Measures were also collected post-intervention from an independent, grade-matched group of students in the new school (n = 21). RESULTS: As expected, maturational increases in SB were observed. However, DD analysis estimated that the intervention attenuated increase in SB by 81.2 _ 11.4 minutes/day (p< 0.001), controlling for time in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The intervention was also estimated to increase daily number of breaks from SB by 23.4 _ 2.6 (p < .001) and to increase light physical activity (LPA) by 67.7 _ 10.7 minutes/day (p< 0.001). However, the intervention decreased MVPA by 10.3 _ 2.3 minutes/day (p< 0.001). Results of grade-matched independent samples analysis were similar, with students in the new vs. old school spending 90.5 _ 16.1 fewer minutes/day in SB, taking 21.1 _ 2.7 more breaks from SB (p< 0.001), and spending 64.5 _ 14.8 more minutes in LPA (p< 0.001), controlling for time in MVPA. Students in the new school spent 13.1 _ 2.7 fewer minutes in MVPA (p< 0.001) than their counterparts in the old school. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study found that active school design had beneficial effects on SB and LPA, but not on MVPA. Mixed results point to a need for active classroom design strategies to mitigate SB, and quick access from classrooms to areas permissive of high-intensity activities to promote MVPA. Integrating active design with programs/policies to promote PA may yield greatest impact on PA of all intensities.",,,9,,,
1849,"Physical activity design guidelines for school architecture Increasing children's physical activity at school is a national focus in the U.S. to address childhood obesity. While research has demonstrated associations between aspects of school environments and students' physical activity, the literature currently lacks a synthesis of evidence to serve as a practical, spatially-organized resource for school designers and decision-makers, as well as to point to pertinent research opportunities. This paper describes the development of a new practical tool: Physical Activity Design Guidelines for School Architecture. Its aims are to provide architects and designers, as well as school planners, educators, and public health professionals, with strategies for making K-12 school environments conducive to healthy physical activity, and to engage scientists in transdisciplinary perspectives toward improved knowledge of the school environment's impact. We used a qualitative review process to develop evidence-based and theory-driven school design guidelines that promote increased physical activity among students. The design guidelines include specific strategies in 10 school design domains. Implementation of the guidelines is expected to enable students to adopt healthier physical activity behaviors. The tool bridges a translational gap between research and environmental design practice, and may contribute to setting new industry and education standards.",,,9,,,
1850,"Comorbid hypertension and diabetes among U.S. women of reproductive age: Prevalence and disparities AIMS: Diabetes is associated with significant pregnancy complications, which can be further exacerbated by comorbid hypertension. Racial/ethnic differentials in the burden of comorbid hypertension and diabetes among women of reproductive age have not been described. METHODS: Using Wave IV of the nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we analyzed survey and biological data from 6576 non-pregnant women who were aged 24-32 in 2007-2008. Hypertension and diabetes were identified by self-report of diagnosis and biological measurements taken during in-home interviews. We used logistic regression models to predict the presence of comorbid hypertension and diabetes and whether each was diagnosed. RESULTS: Over a third (36.0%) of women with diabetes had comorbid hypertension. Compared to non-Hispanic white women, more non-Hispanic black women had comorbid hypertension and diabetes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.93, 95% CI 3.84-9.16), and, if comorbid, were less likely to have a diabetes diagnosis (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.007-0.1) or hypertension diagnosis (aOR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.65). CONCLUSION: Comorbid hypertension and diabetes are more common among non-Hispanic black women and less likely to be diagnosed, signaling disparities threatening maternal and child health among women with diabetes.

1851,"Contraceptive Use Among Women with Prediabetes and Diabetes in a US National Sample INTRODUCTION: Although elevated blood glucose is associated with adverse maternal and fetal health outcomes, evidence suggests that women with diabetes may not be receiving comprehensive reproductive health care, including family planning and preconception care. Using a population-based sample, we evaluated the relationship between contraceptive use and biomarker-identified diabetes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from 5548 women in the nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) from 2007 to 2009. Women were aged 24 to 32 years, sexually active with men, and not pregnant. Hemoglobin A1C identified prediabetes and diabetes from blood specimens. The primary outcome was most effective contraception used in the past year: more effective (sterilization, intrauterine device, implant, combined hormonal methods, or injectable), less effective (condoms, diaphragms, spermicides, natural family planning, or withdrawal), or none. Multinomial regression models were adjusted for race and ethnicity, education, insurance, health care access, and body mass index. RESULTS: Of the women with diabetes, 37.6% used more effective contraception, 33.6% less effective contraception, and 28.8% none. Women with diabetes had higher odds of using no contraception, rather than more effective contraception, than women with normoglycemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.90; 95% CI, 1.25-2.87). Women with diabetes who were undiagnosed had greater odds of using less effective contraception, rather than more effective contraception, compared with those who were diagnosed (aOR 3.39; 95% CI, 1.44-7.96). Contraceptive use did not differ between women with prediabetes and normoglycemia. DISCUSSION: Less effective contraceptive methods were commonly used by women with diabetes. Midwives and other women's health care providers can support women with diabetes to reach their pregnancy goals by providing preconception care and family planning. _ 2018 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.",,,4,,,
1852,"Racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes diagnosis and glycemic control among women of reproductive age BACKGROUND: Types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus complicate pregnancies and threaten the health of women of reproductive age and their children. Among older adults, diabetes morbidity disproportionately burdens racial/ethnic minorities, but diabetes emergence among younger adults has not been as well characterized. The objective of this study was to describe the distribution of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, suboptimal preconception glycemic control, and prediabetes among women of reproductive age across racial/ethnic backgrounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data collected in 2007-2008 from 6774 nonpregnant women, ages 24-32, in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were identified by fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and diagnosed diabetes by self-report or antihyperglycemic medication use. We used multinomial regression models to predict prediabetes or diabetes versus normoglycemia. Within women with diabetes, we used logistic regression to predict those being undiagnosed and having suboptimal preconception glycemic control based on A1C. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of diabetes was 6.8%, of which 45.3% was undiagnosed. Diabetes prevalence varied by race/ethnicity (p_< _0.001): 15.0% of non-Hispanic black women (75.6% undiagnosed), 7.5% of Hispanic women (48.1% undiagnosed), 4.8% of non-Hispanic white women (22.8% undiagnosed), and 4.5% of Asian women (11.4% undiagnosed). The prevalence of prediabetes was highest in non-Hispanic black (38.5%), followed by Hispanic (27.8%), Asian (25.1%), Native American (20.3%), and non-Hispanic white (16.6%) women. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities exist among women of reproductive age with prediabetes and diabetes. Meeting their healthcare needs requires addressing health inequities and coordination of diabetes management with reproductive health.",,,4,,,
1853,"Recruiting diverse smokers: enrollment yields and cost To help tobacco control research better include vulnerable populations, we sought to identify effective ways to recruit diverse smokers. In 2014-2015, we recruited 2149 adult cigarette smokers in California and North Carolina, United States, to participate in a randomized trial of pictorial cigarette pack warnings. The most effective means of recruiting smokers were the classified advertising website Craigslist (28% of participants), word of mouth (23%), Facebook (16%), and flyers or postcards (14%). Low-income and African American smokers were more likely to respond to interpersonal contact (including staff in-person recruitment and word of mouth) than were high-income and non-African American smokers (all p < 0.05). Hispanic and gay, lesbian, and bisexual smokers were more likely to be recruited by Craigslist than non-Hispanic and straight smokers (both p < 0.05). Of the recruitment methods requiring cost, the cheapest was Craigslist ($3-7 per smoker). The most expensive methods were newspaper ads in California ($375 per smoker) and staff in-person recruiting in North Carolina ($180 per smoker). Successfully recruiting diverse smokers requires using multiple methods including interpersonal, online, and other media. Craigslist and word of mouth are especially useful and low-cost ways to recruit diverse smokers.",,,3,,,
1854,"Evidence of high-risk sexual behaviors among injection drug users in the Kenya PLACE study BACKGROUND: Injection drug users (IDUs) in resource poor settings are at high risk for HIV transmission through unsafe needle-sharing and sexual practices. We report on the injecting and sexual behavior of a sample of IDUs from Malindi, Kenya. METHODS: A Priority for Local AIDS Control Efforts (PLACE) study was conducted from April to May 2010 to identify areas where HIV transmission is most likely to occur and specific venues where people meet new sexual partners. Community informants (n=202) listed 157 unique venues from which 29 were randomly selected using a systematic fixed interval sampling strategy with probability of selection proportional to venue size. Twenty patrons and four workers were interviewed at each venue. Drug use practices were elicited in a staff-administered interview. RESULTS: Between 40% and 50% of IDUs reported needle-sharing, taking drugs from a common reservoir, using a ready-made solution without boiling, and not exchanging a used for a new syringe in the past month. Most could inconsistently or never get new syringes. In multivariate logistic regression models controlling for age, education, residence, and poverty status, IDUs were twice as likely as non-IDUs to report multiple partners in the past year (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.26-3.00, p< .01) and multiple new partners in the past year (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.30-3.42, p< .01). CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of multiple sexual partnerships and risky injecting behaviors among IDUs and unavailability of new injecting needles are likely facilitating HIV transmission in Malindi, Kenya.

1855,"Association of heat shock proteins with all-cause mortality Experimental mild heat shock is widely known as an intervention that results in extended longevity in various models along the evolutionary lineage. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are highly upregulated immediately after a heat shock. The elevation in HSP levels was shown to inhibit stress-mediated cell death, and recent experiments indicate a highly versatile role for these proteins as inhibitors of programmed cell death. In this study, we examined common genetic variations in 31 genes encoding all members of the HSP70, small HSP, and heat shock factor (HSF) families for their association with all-cause mortality. Our discovery cohort was the Rotterdam study (RS1) containing 5,974 participants aged 55 years and older (3,174 deaths). We assessed 4,430 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the HumanHap550K Genotyping BeadChip from Illumina. After adjusting for multiple testing by permutation analysis, three SNPs showed evidence for association with all-cause mortality in RS1. These findings were followed in eight independent population-based cohorts, leading to a total of 25,007 participants (8,444 deaths). In the replication phase, only HSF2 (rs1416733) remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Rs1416733 is a known cis-eQTL for HSF2. Our findings suggest a role of HSF2 in all-cause mortality.",,,5,,,
1856,"Evaluating different criteria for defining a complete ambulatory blood pressure monitoring recording: data from the Jackson Heart Study OBJECTIVE: We determined differences in the prevalence of blood pressure (BP) phenotypes and the association of these phenotypes with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) for individuals who fulfilled and did not fulfill various criteria used for defining a complete ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) recording. METHODS: We analyzed data for 1141 participants from the Jackson Heart Study. Criteria evaluated included having greater than or equal to 80% of planned readings with more than or equal to one reading per hour (Spanish ABPM Registry criteria), more than or equal to 70% of planned readings with a minimum of 20 daytime and seven nighttime readings (2013 European Society of Hypertension criteria), greater than or equal to 14 daytime and greater than or equal to seven nighttime readings (2003 European Society of Hypertension criteria), more than or equal to 10 daytime and more than or equal to 5 nighttime readings (International Database of Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcome criteria), and greater than or equal to 14 daytime readings (UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence criteria). RESULTS: Between 45.0% (Spanish ABPM Registry) and 91.8% (UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence) of the participants fulfilled the different criteria for a complete ABPM recording. Across the various criteria evaluated, 55.5-57.8% of participants had nocturnal hypertension and 62.8-66.8% had nondipping systolic BP. Among participants with clinic-measured systolic/diastolic BP of more than or equal to 140/90__mHg, 22.9-26.5% had white-coat hypertension. The prevalence of daytime, 24-h, sustained, and masked hypertension differed by up to 2% for participants fulfilling each criterion. The association of BP phenotypes with LVH was similar for participants who fulfilled versus those who did not fulfill different criteria (each P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the criteria used for defining a complete ABPM recording, the prevalence of BP phenotypes and their association with LVH were similar.",,,5,,,
1857,"Confounding control in healthcare database research: challenges and potential approaches Epidemiologic studies are increasingly used to investigate the safety and effectiveness of medical products and interventions. Appropriate adjustment for confounding in such studies is challenging because exposure is determined by a complex interaction of patient, physician, and healthcare system factors. The challenges of confounding control are particularly acute in studies using healthcare utilization databases where information on many potential confounding factors is lacking and the meaning of variables is often unclear. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to confounder control in healthcare databases. In settings where considerable uncertainty surrounds the data or the causal mechanisms underlying the treatment assignment and outcome process, we suggest that researchers report a panel of results under various specifications of statistical models. Such reporting allows the reader to assess the sensitivity of the results to model assumptions that are often not supported by strong subject-matter knowledge.",,,7,,,
1858,"A community-engaged approach to investigate cardiovascular-associated inflammation among American Indian women: A research protocol American Indian women are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) than White or African American women. Inflammatory processes may underlie CVD disparities by gender and race and may be critical to understanding population-specific drivers and potential buffers. Exposure to environmental air pollutants, especially particulate matter (PM), is known to be an important catalyst in CVD-associated inflammation. Positive psychological states, associated with low levels of inflammatory gene expression, could serve to moderate the inflammatory response to environmental air pollutants and ultimately lead to better cardiovascular health outcomes. The aim of the ongoing community-engaged and NIH-funded study described in this study protocol is to address the racial and gender gaps in CVD mortality by investigating the contextually relevant and culturally important determinants of health among American Indian women. In this paper we describe the procedures used to examine the relationship between environmental air pollutant exposures (PM10-2.5 and PM 2.5 ), psychological factors (e.g., depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, eudemonic well-being, and positive emotions), and cardiovascular-associated inflammation (hs-CRP, IL-6, Amyloid A, CBCs with differentials) in a sample of 150 women 18-50 years of age from the Lumbee Tribe in southeastern North Carolina. We describe lessons learned and strategies used in developing a community-engaged approach to enhance recruitment of American Indian women in biomedical research. The empirical data and community infrastructure resulting from this study will be foundational in designing and testing future interventions to reduce CVD-associated morbidity and mortality in American Indian women. _ 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,
1859,"Cadmium inhibits placental trophoblast cell migration via miRNA regulation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-_) pathway Preeclampsia (PE), a condition during pregnancy that involves high blood pressure and proteinuria, is potentially fatal to both mother and child. PE currently has no known etiology or cure but has been tied to poor placental trophoblast cell migration. Increased levels of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd) have been associated with increased risk of developing PE, as well as miRNA-associated regulation of the transforming growth factorbeta (TGF-_) pathway. Signal reprogramming of the TGF-_ pathway via epigenetic mechanisms is hypothesized to modify placental trophoblast function. In the present study we investigated the role of increased and decreased signaling of the TGF-_ pathway in relation to Cd-induced reduction in cellular migration in JEG3 trophoblast cells. Furthermore, the role of a miR-26a as a molecular mediator of placental trophoblast migration was confirmed. The results demonstrate that increased expression of miR-26a and decreased signaling of the TGF-_ pathway increase placental cell migration. These findings have relevance for mechanistic understanding of the underpinnings of poor placentation associated with PE. Copyright _ 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,3,,,
1860,"miRNAs as common regulators of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-_ pathway in the preeclamptic placenta and cadmium-treated trophoblasts: Links between the environment, the epigenome and preeclampsia Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy disorder characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria that can cause adverse health effects in both mother and fetus. There is no current cure for PE other than delivery of the fetus/placenta. While the etiology is unknown, poor placentation due to aberrant signaling of growth and angiogenic factors has been postulated as a causal factor of PE. In addition, environmental contaminants, such as the metal cadmium (Cd), have been linked to placental toxicity and increased risk of developing PE. Here, we use a translational study design to investigate genomic and epigenomic alterations in both placentas and placental trophoblasts, focused on the angiogenesis-associated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-_) pathway. Genes within the TGF-_ pathway displayed increased expression in both the preeclamptic placenta and Cd-treated trophoblasts. In addition, miRNAs that target the TGF-_ pathway were also significantly altered within the preeclamptic placenta and Cd-treated trophoblasts. Integrative analysis resulted in the identification of a subset of Cd-responsive miRNAs, including miR-26a and miR-155, common to preeclamptic placentas and Cd-treated trophoblasts. These miRNAs have previously been linked to PE and are predicted to regulate members of the TGF-_ pathway. Results from this study provide future targets for PE treatment.

1861,"Predictors of latent trajectory classes of physical dating violence victimization This study identified classes of developmental trajectories of physical dating violence victimization from grades 8 to 12 and examined theoretically-based risk factors that distinguished among trajectory classes. Data were from a multi-wave longitudinal study spanning 8th through 12th grade (n = 2,566; 51.9 % female). Growth mixture models were used to identify trajectory classes of physical dating violence victimization separately for girls and boys. Logistic and multinomial logistic regressions were used to identify situational and target vulnerability factors associated with the trajectory classes. For girls, three trajectory classes were identified: a low/non-involved class; a moderate class where victimization increased slightly until the 10th grade and then decreased through the 12th grade; and a high class where victimization started at a higher level in the 8th grade, increased substantially until the 10th grade, and then decreased until the 12th grade. For males, two classes were identified: a low/non-involved class, and a victimized class where victimization increased slightly until the 9th grade, decreased until the 11th grade, and then increased again through the 12th grade. In bivariate analyses, almost all of the situational and target vulnerability risk factors distinguished the victimization classes from the non-involved classes. However, when all risk factors and control variables were in the model, alcohol use (a situational vulnerability) was the only factor that distinguished membership in the moderate trajectory class from the non-involved class for girls; anxiety and being victimized by peers (target vulnerability factors) were the factors that distinguished the high from the non-involved classes for the girls; and victimization by peers was the only factor distinguishing the victimized from the non-involved class for boys. These findings contribute to our understanding of the heterogeneity in physical dating violence victimization during adolescence and the malleable risk factors associated with each trajectory class for boys and girls.",,,9,,,
1862,"Associations between eating expectancies and Eating disorder symptoms in men and women Eating expectancies, or learned expectations that an individual has about eating, prospectively predict eating disorder (ED) symptoms. Most studies examining eating expectancies have focused on one or two eating expectancies and their relation with bulimic symptoms. In addition, these studies have been conducted mostly in women. Thus, it is unclear whether: 1) associations between eating expectancies and ED symptoms vary between men and women, and 2) extend to ED symptoms other than bulimic symptoms. The current study (N_=_197 undergraduate men and 246 undergraduate women) investigated sex variance in a model of eating expectancies and ED symptoms, including factors associated with ED symptoms (i.e., negative urgency, negative affect, alcohol use, drug use, and body mass index). Sex variance was tested using path analysis in a model including eating expectancies and associated factors, with excessive exercise, negative attitudes toward obesity, restricting, cognitive restraint, binge eating, purging, muscle building, and body dissatisfaction as dependent variables. Unconstrained (i.e., unconstrained paths across men and women) and constrained (i.e., constraining paths across men and women) models were tested. The unconstrained and constrained models differed significantly, indicating that the models varied by sex. For both sexes, eating expectancies were uniquely associated with ED symptoms. For men, Eating Manages Negative Affect was significantly associated with the most ED symptoms. In contrast, for women, Eating Leads to Feeling Out of Control was associated with the most ED symptoms. Previous findings regarding eating expectancies and ED symptoms in women may not generalize to men. Intervening on eating expectancies in a sex-specific way may help reduce specific ED symptoms.

1863,"Evaluating the incident user design in the HIV population: incident use versus naive? INTRODUCTION: The incident user design is the preferred study design in comparative effectiveness (CER) research. Usually, 180-365__ays of exposure free time is adequate to remove biases associated with inclusion of prevalent users. In HIV research, the use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) at any time in the past may influence future treatment choices and CER results; thus, identifying naive as opposed to incident users is of importance. We examined misclassification of antiretroviral naive status based on Medicaid administrative data through linkage to the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort (UCHCC). METHODS: We identified Medicaid patients with incident exposure to common first-line ARV regimens between 2002 and 2008 that were also patients enrolled in the UCHCC. We calculated the proportion of antiretroviral naive patients based on the UCHCC, among patients identified as having incident exposure in Medicaid and examined factors associated with being antiretroviral naive in both data sources using logistic regression to generate prevalence odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Of the 3500 Medicaid patients with incident antiretroviral (ARV) exposure, 1344 were also enrolled in the UCHCC. In this sample, 34% were antiretroviral naive at the time of first exposure in the Medicaid data based on the UCHCC. In multivariable models, higher CD4 cell counts and log HIV RNA values were associated with being antiretroviral naive in both data sources. CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data are an important source of information related to HIV treatment. As the construction of a durable and long-lasting HIV treatment plan involves knowledge of current and past antiretroviral therapy, augmentation of this data with comprehensive clinical cohort information is necessary.

1864,"Validation of Medicaid Claims-based Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction Using an HIV Clinical Cohort BACKGROUND: In nonexperimental comparative effectiveness research using health care databases, outcome measurements must be validated to evaluate and potentially adjust for misclassification bias. We aimed to validate claims-based myocardial infarction (MI) algorithms in a Medicaid population using an HIV clinical cohort as the gold standard. METHODS: Medicaid administrative data were obtained for the years 2002-2008 and linked to the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort based on social security number, first name, and last name and MI were adjudicated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: There were 1063 individuals included in the study. Over a median observed time of 2.5 years, 17 had an MI. Specificity ranged from 0.979 to 0.993 with the highest specificity obtained using the ICD-9 code 410.xx in the primary or secondary position and a length of stay >3 days. Sensitivity of MI ascertainment varied from 0.588 to 0.824 depending on algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Specificities of varying claims-based MI ascertainment criteria are high but small changes impact positive predictive value in a cohort with low incidence. Sensitivities vary based on ascertainment criteria. Type of algorithm used should be prioritized based on study question and maximization of specific validation parameters that will minimize bias while also considering precision.",,,8,,,
1865,"Effects of combination antiretroviral therapies on the risk of myocardial infarction among HIV patients BACKGROUND: Cohort studies have demonstrated greater risk of myocardial infarction (MI) associated with specific antiretroviral use, while meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not. These differences may be due to inherent biases in the observational study design or to the limited duration of randomized trials. We conducted a new-user, active-comparator cohort study emulating an RCT comparing the initiation of several antiretrovirals as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and MI. METHODS: We included North Carolina (NC) Medicaid beneficiaries infected with human immunodeficiency virus between 2002 and 2008 who were previously untreated with cART. We compared hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MI between abacavir and tenofovir recipients, and lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir recipients and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) recipients. We adjusted for confounding through inverse probability weighting methods. RESULTS: There were 3481 NC Medicaid new cART recipients who contributed 6399 person-years and experienced 38 MI events. Receiving abacavir compared with tenofovir as part of cART was associated with an increased rate of MI (unadjusted HR = 2.70 [95% CI = 1.24-5.91]; adjusted HR = 2.05 [0.72-5.86]). Point estimates also suggest a relationship between receipt of atazanavir or lopinavir-ritonavir compared with an NNRTI and MI, although estimates were imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased rate of MI among patients initiating abacavir compared with tenofovir, although the association was decreased after confounding adjustment. Without a very large prospective comparative clinical trial, a much larger observational study of patients initiating cART would be needed to better define this apparent association.",,,8,,,
1866,"Structural interventions to reduce and eliminate health disparities Health disparities research in the United States over the past 2 decades has yielded considerable progress and contributed to a developing evidence base for interventions that tackle disparities in health status and access to care. However, health disparity interventions have focused primarily on individual and interpersonal factors, which are often limited in their ability to yield sustained improvements. Health disparities emerge and persist through complex mechanisms that include socioeconomic, environmental, and system-level factors. To accelerate the reduction of health disparities and yield enduring health outcomes requires broader approaches that intervene upon these structural determinants. Although an increasing number of innovative programs and policies have been deployed to address structural determinants, few explicitly focused on their impact on minority health and health disparities. Rigorously evaluated, evidence-based structural interventions are needed to address multilevel structural determinants that systemically lead to and perpetuate social and health inequities. This article highlights examples of structural interventions that have yielded health benefits, discusses challenges and opportunities for accelerating improvements in minority health, and proposes recommendations to foster the development of structural interventions likely to advance health disparities research.",,,7,,,
1867,"Broad spectrum antiviral remdesivir inhibits human endemic and zoonotic deltacoronaviruses with a highly divergent RNA dependent RNA polymerase The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (CoV) family is prone to cross species transmission and disease emergence in both humans and livestock. Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need. Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values. Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs. Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging CoV.

This study measures preference-based health state utility (HSU) values, a scaled index of health-related quality of life for economic evaluation, for younger women with breast cancer and compares these values with same-age women with other cancers and older women (aged _45 years) with breast cancer. METHODS: Data from the 2009 and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed in 2014. The sample included 218,852 women; 7,433 and 18,577 had histories of breast and other cancers. HSU values were estimated using Healthy Days survey questions and a published mapping algorithm. Linear regression models for HSU were estimated by age group (18-44 and _45 years). RESULTS: The adjusted breast cancer HSU impact was four times larger for younger women than for older women (-0.097 vs -0.024, p< 0.001). For younger women, the effect of breast cancer on HSU was 70% larger than that of other cancers (-0.097 vs -0.057, p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Younger breast cancer survivors reported lower HSU values than older survivors, highlighting the impact of breast cancer on the physical and mental health of younger women. The estimates may be used to evaluate quality-adjusted life-years or expectancy for prevention or treatment of breast cancer. This study also indicates that separate quality of life adjustments for women by age group are important for economic analysis of public health breast cancer interventions.

1871,"Microbiological effectiveness of mineral pot filters in Cambodia Mineral pot filters (MPFs) are household water treatment (HWT) devices that are manufactured and distributed by the private sector, with millions of users in Southeast Asia. Their effectiveness in reducing waterborne microbes has not been previously investigated. We purchased three types of MPFs available on the Cambodian market for systematic evaluation of bacteria, virus, and protozoan surrogate microbial reduction in laboratory challenge experiments following WHO recommended performance testing protocols. Results over the total 1500 L testing period per filter indicate that the devices tested were highly effective in reducing Esherichia coli (99.99%+), moderately effective in reducing bacteriophage MS2 (99%+), and somewhat effective against Bacillus atrophaeus, a spore-forming bacterium we used as a surrogate for protozoa (88%+). Treatment mechanisms for all filters included porous ceramic and activated carbon filtration. Our results suggest that these commercially available filters may be at least as effective against waterborne pathogens as other, locally available treatment options such as ceramic pot filters or boiling. More research is needed on the role these devices may play as interim solutions to the problem of unsafe drinking water in Cambodia and globally.",,,5,,,
1872,"A controlled, before-and-after trial of an urban sanitation intervention to reduce enteric infections in children: research protocol for the Maputo Sanitation (MapSan) study, Mozambique INTRODUCTION: Access to safe sanitation in low-income, informal settlements of Sub-Saharan Africa has not significantly improved since 1990. The combination of a high faecal-related disease burden and inadequate infrastructure suggests that investment in expanding sanitation access in densely populated urban slums can yield important public health gains. No rigorous, controlled intervention studies have evaluated the health effects of decentralised (non-sewerage) sanitation in an informal urban setting, despite the role that such technologies will likely play in scaling up access. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have designed a controlled, before-and-after (CBA) trial to estimate the health impacts of an urban sanitation intervention in informal neighbourhoods of Maputo, Mozambique, including an assessment of whether exposures and health outcomes vary by localised population density. The intervention consists of private pour-flush latrines (to septic tank) shared by multiple households in compounds or household clusters. We will measure objective health outcomes in approximately 760 children (380 children with household access to interventions, 380 matched controls using existing shared private latrines in poor sanitary conditions), at 2 time points: immediately before the intervention and at follow-up after 12 months. The primary outcome is combined prevalence of selected enteric infections among children under 5 years of age. Secondary outcome measures include soil-transmitted helminth (STH) reinfection in children following baseline deworming and prevalence of reported diarrhoeal disease. We will use exposure assessment, faecal source tracking, and microbial transmission modelling to examine whether and how routes of exposure for diarrhoeagenic pathogens and STHs change following introduction of effective sanitation. ETHICS: Study protocols have been reviewed and approved by human subjects review boards at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Ministry of Health, Republic of Mozambique.

1873,"Relative benefits of on-plot water supply over other 'improved' sources in rural Vietnam OBJECTIVE: Access to improved water sources is rapidly expanding in rural central Vietnam. We examined one NGO-led piped water supply programme to assess the drinking water quality and health impacts of piped water systems where access to 'improved' water sources is already good. METHODS: This longitudinal, prospective cohort study followed 300 households in seven project areas in Da Nang province, Vietnam: 224 households who paid for an on-plot piped water connection and 76 control households from the same areas relying primarily on 'improved' water sources outside the home. The 4-month study was intended to measure the impact of the NGO-led water programmes on households' drinking water quality and health and to evaluate system performance. RESULTS: We found that: (i) households connected to a piped water supply had consistently better drinking water quality than those relying on other sources, including 'improved' sources and (ii) connected households experienced less diarrhoea than households without a piped water connection (adjusted longitudinal prevalence ratio: 0.57 (95% CI 0.39-0.86, P = 0.006) and households using an 'improved' source not piped to the plot: (adjusted longitudinal prevalence ratio: 0.59 (95% CI 0.39-0.91, P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that on-plot water service yields benefits over other sources that are considered 'improved' by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. _ 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,1,,,
1874,"Boiling as household water treatment in Cambodia: a longitudinal study of boiling practice and microbiological effectiveness This paper focuses on the consistency of use and microbiological effectiveness of boiling as it is practiced in one study site in peri-urban Cambodia. We followed 60 randomly selected households in Kandal Province over 6 months to collect longitudinal data on water boiling practices and effectiveness in reducing Escherichia coli in household drinking water. Despite > 90% of households reporting that they used boiling as a means of drinking water treatment, an average of only 31% of households had boiled water on hand at follow-up visits, suggesting that actual use may be lower than self-reported use. We collected 369 matched untreated and boiled water samples. Mean reduction of E. coli was 98.5%; 162 samples (44%) of boiled samples were free of E. coli (< 1 colony-forming unit [cfu]/100 mL), and 270 samples (73%) had < 10 cfu/100 mL. Storing boiled water in a covered container was associated with safer product water than storage in an uncovered container.",,,1,,,
1875,"Admixture Mapping Identifies an Amerindian Ancestry Locus Associated with Albuminuria in Hispanics in the United States Increased urine albumin excretion is highly prevalent in Hispanics/Latinos. Previous studies have found an association between urine albumin excretion and Amerindian ancestry in Hispanic/Latino populations. Admixture between racial/ethnic groups creates long-range linkage disequilibrium between variants with different allelic frequencies in the founding populations and it can be used to localize genes. Hispanic/Latino genomes are an admixture of European, African, and Amerindian ancestries. We leveraged this admixture to identify associations between urine albumin excretion (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) and genomic regions harboring variants with highly differentiated allele frequencies among the ancestral populations. Admixture mapping analysis of 12,212 Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos participants, using a linear mixed model, identified three novel genome-wide significant signals on chromosomes 2, 11, and 16. The admixture mapping signal identified on chromosome 2, spanning q11.2-14.1 and not previously reported for UACR, is driven by a difference between Amerindian ancestry and the other two ancestries (P< 5.7 _ 10-5). Within this locus, two common variants located at the proapoptotic BCL2L11 gene associated with UACR: rs116907128 (allele frequency =0.14; P=1.5 _ 10-7) and rs586283 (C allele frequency =0.35; P=4.2 _ 10-7). In a secondary analysis, rs116907128 accounted for most of the admixture mapping signal observed in the region. The rs116907128 variant is common among full-heritage Pima Indians (A allele frequency =0.54) but is monomorphic in the 1000 Genomes European and African populations. In a replication analysis using a sample of full-heritage Pima Indians, rs116907128 significantly associated with UACR (P=0.01; n=1568). Our findings provide evidence for the presence of Amerindian-specific variants influencing the variation of urine albumin excretion in Hispanics/Latinos.

1876,"HIV partner notification is effective and feasible in sub-Saharan Africa: opportunities for HIV treatment and prevention BACKGROUND: Sexual partners of persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection require HIV counseling, testing and, if necessary, evaluation for therapy. However, many African countries do not have a standardized protocol for partner notification, and the effectiveness of partner notification has not been evaluated in developing countries . METHODS: Individuals with newly diagnosed HIV infection presenting to sexually transmitted infection clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi, were randomized to 1 of 3 methods of partner notification: passive referral, contract referral, or provider referral. The passive referral group was responsible for notifying their partners themselves. The contract referral group was given seven days to notify their partners, after which a health care provider contacted partners who had not reported for counseling and testing. In the provider referral group, a health care provider notified partners directly. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-five index patients named 302 sexual partners and provided locator information for 252. Among locatable partners, 107 returned for HIV counseling and testing; 20 of 82 [24%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 15% to 34%] partners returned in the passive referral arm, 45 of 88 (51%; 95% CI: 41% to 62%) in the contract referral arm, and 42 of 82 (51%; 95% CI: 40% to 62%) in the provider referral arm (P < 0.001). Among returning partners (n = 107), 67 (64%) of were HIV infected with 54 (81%) newly diagnosed. DISCUSSION: This study provides the first evidence of the effectiveness of partner notification in sub-Saharan Africa. Active partner notification was feasible, acceptable, and effective among sexually transmitted infections clinic patients. Partner notification will increase early referral to care and facilitate risk reduction among high-risk uninfected partners.",,,6,,,
1877,"Pharmacological approaches to the management of binge eating disorder In the USA, binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of ~3.5_% in adult women, 2.0_% in adult men, and 1.6_% in adolescents. BED is characterized by frequent episodes of binge eating that are accompanied by a sense of loss of control over eating and result in marked psychological distress. BED is highly co-morbid with obesity and with depression and other psychiatric conditions, and it is associated with substantial role impairment. Currently, there are no US FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for BED. Animal and human studies implicate underlying dysregulation in dopamine, opioid, acetylcholine, and serotonin neurocircuitry within brain reward regions in the pathogenesis and maintenance of BED. To date, the efficacy of various agents that target these and other neurotransmitter systems involved in motivated feeding behavior, mood regulation, and impulse control have been investigated in the treatment of BED. Several antidepressant and anticonvulsant agents have demonstrated efficacy in reducing binge eating frequency, but only in limited cases have these effects resulted in patients achieving abstinence, which is the primary goal of treatment; they also range from less (fluvoxamine) to more (topiramate) effective in achieving weight loss that is both clinically meaningful and significantly greater than placebo. Collectively, the literature on pharmacological treatment approaches to BED is limited in that very few agents have been studied in multiple, confirmatory trials with adequate follow up, and almost none have been evaluated in large patient samples that are diverse with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity. In addition, prior trials have not adequately addressed, through study design, the high placebo response commonly observed in this patient population. Several novel agents are in various phases of testing, and recent animal studies focusing on glutamate-signaling circuits linking the amygdala to the lateral hypothalamus offer new avenues for exploration and potential therapeutic development. Studies of newly FDA-approved medications for long-term obesity treatment and further explorations of dietary supplements and neutraceuticals with appetite- and mood-altering properties may also be worthwhile.",,,1,,,
1878,"Lessons from a mixed-methods approach to evaluating Active Living by Design BACKGROUND: Beginning in 2003, Active Living by Design (ALbD) established innovative approaches across 25 communities to increase physical activity through community design, public policies, programming, and communication strategies. PURPOSE: The complexity of the ALbD projects called for a mixed-methods evaluation to understand implementation as well as perceived and actual impacts of these efforts. METHODS: Six primary evaluation methods addressed three primary aims: (1) to assess impacts of physical projects and policy changes on community environments; (2) to document intervention strategies implemented, as well as intended and unintended consequences; and (3) to identify strengths and challenges in planning, developing, and implementing interventions. The ALbD evaluation included cross-site comparisons and more in-depth case studies. This article describes the methods used to address the three aims. RESULTS: Analysis of the strengths and challenges associated with the different methods, including partnership capacity surveys, Concept Mapping, an online progress reporting system, key informant interviews, focus groups, and photos and videos. Additional methods, including environmental audits and direct observation, were explored to specifically assess environmental changes. Several important challenges included the lack of baseline data, difficulty in evaluating natural experiments, the need for ongoing policy surveillance, and the need to capture longer-term endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed-methods evaluation of ALbD advances implementation and evaluation science related to community-based efforts for promoting active living through identification of methods and measures to capture multicomponent and complex interventions as well as translation of a range of approaches to create community change across a variety of populations and settings.

1880,"Associations of Social Support and 8-Year Follow-Up Depressive Symptoms: Differences in African American and White Caregivers The present study used data from the Alzheimer's Study of Emotions in Caregivers (ASEC) to evaluate perceptions of social support assessed at baseline, as well as changes in social support assessed at a follow-up eight-years later, as predictors of symptoms of change in depression, with a focus on race as a potential moderator of these relationships. Specifically, multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, income, education, race, living arrangement of care recipient at baseline, death of care recipient, the cultural justification for caregiving scale (CJCS), and baseline depressive symptoms were conducted to assess baseline social support ratings, as well as the change in social support over time as a predictor of depression at follow-up-with a focus on moderation by race. Baseline social support (F(1,77) = 7.60, p=.008) was associated with fewer depressive symptoms at follow-up for all participants. The change in social support over time was also related to depressive symptoms, with effects moderated by race (F(1,77) = 7.97, p = .007), such that when support decreased over time depressive symptoms at follow-up were higher for Whites, as compared with African Americans, whereas, when social support increased over time depressive symptoms tended to be similar for both groups. These findings indicate that research designed to plan interventions in caregivers must not ignore potential racial differences with regard to the effects of caregiving on mental health.",,,2,,,

Group-based trajectory modeling followed by multinomial logistic regression was used to identify distinct trajectories and their association with baseline characteristics among 1239 HIV-infected UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort participants, 2000-2014. Three trajectories were identified: (1) 72% never/sporadic opioid use (referent group), (2) 11% episodic use (associated with female sex, depression, drug-related diagnoses, antiretroviral therapy use, and undetectable HIV RNA), and (3) 16% chronic use (associated with older age, female sex, and mental health diagnoses).

1882,"HLA associations with infliximab-induced liver injury Biomarkers that are able to identify patients at risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) after treatment with infliximab could be important in increasing the safety of infliximab use. We performed a genetic analysis to identify possible human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations with DILI in European Caucasian users of infliximab in a retrospective study of 16 infliximab-DILI patients and 60 matched controls. In infliximab-associated liver injury, multiple potentially causal individual HLA associations were observed, as well as possible haplotypes. The strongest associated HLA allele was HLA-B*39:01 (P_=_0.001; odds ratio [OR] 43.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-infinity), which always appeared with another associated allele C*12:03 (P_=_0.032; OR 6.1; 95% CI 0.9-47.4). Other associations were observed with HLAs DQB1*02:01 (P_=_0.007; OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.4-24.8), DRB1*03:01 (P_=_0.012; OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.2-20.5), and B*08:01 (P_=_0.048; OR 3.4; 95% CI 0.9-13.2), which also appeared together whenever present in cases. Additional associations were found with HLA-DPB1*10:01 (P_=_0.042; OR 20.9; 95% CI 0.7-infinity) and HLA-DRB1*04:04 (P_=_0.042; OR 20.9; 95% CI 0.7-infinity). A strong association with HLA-B*39:01 was identified as a potentially causal risk factor for infliximab-induced DILI. Future work should aim to validate this finding and explore possible mechanisms through which the biologic interacts with this particular allele.",,,3,,,
1883,"Hormonal contraception, breastfeeding and bedside advocacy: the case for patient-centered care Postpartum contraceptive decision making is complex, and recommendations may be influenced by breastfeeding intentions. While biologically plausible, concerns about the adverse impact of hormonal contraception on breast milk production have not been supported by the clinical evidence to date. However, the data have limitations, which can lead providers with different priorities around contraception and breastfeeding to interpret the data in a way that advances their personal priorities. Discrepancies in interpretations can lead to divergent recommendations for individual women and may cause conflict. Furthermore, providers must recognize that decision making about contraception and breastfeeding takes place in complex cultural, historical and socioeconomic contexts. Implicit bias may influence a provider's counseling. Unrecognized biases toward one patient or another, or one practice or another, may influence a provider's counseling. It is crucial for providers to strive to recognize their own biases. Providers need to respectfully recognize each patient's values and preferences regarding hormonal contraception and breastfeeding. Developing a patient-centered decision tool or implementing patient-centered interview techniques specifically around breastfeeding and contraception could help to minimize provider-driven variability in care.

1884,"Contraceptive practices, preferences, and barriers among abortion clients in north carolina OBJECTIVES: Abortion clinics provide an ideal setting for women to receive contraceptive care because the women served may not have other contacts with the health system and are at risk for unintended pregnancies. The objective of this study was to understand practices, preferences, and barriers to use of contraception for women obtaining abortions at clinics in North Carolina. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of abortion clients and facilities at 10 abortion clinics in North Carolina. We collected data on contraceptive availability at each clinic. We collected individual responses on women's experiences obtaining contraception before the current pregnancy and their intentions for future use of contraception. RESULTS: From October 2015 to February 2016, 376 client surveys were completed at 9 clinics, and 10 clinic surveys were completed. Almost one-third of women (29%) reported that they had wanted to use contraception in the last year but were unable. Approximately three-fourths of respondents (76%) stated that they intend to use contraception after this pregnancy. Approximately one-fifth of women stated that would like to use long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) after this abortion. Only the clinics that accepted insurance for abortion and other services provided LARC at the time of the abortion (40%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a unique, statewide view into the contraceptive barriers for women seeking abortion in North Carolina. Addressing the relatively high demand for LARC after abortion could help significantly reduce unintended pregnancy and recourse to abortion in North Carolina.",,,6,,,
1885,"Pilot randomized trial of an electronic symptom monitoring and reporting intervention for hospitalized adults undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation PURPOSE: Patients undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) have varied symptoms during their hospitalization. This study examined whether daily symptom reporting (with electronic patient-reported outcomes [PROs]) in an inpatient bone marrow transplant clinic reduced symptom burden on post-transplant days +7, +10, and +14. METHODS: A prospective, single-institution 1:1 pilot randomized, two-arm study recruited HCT patients. HCT inpatients (N_=_76) reported daily on 16 common symptoms using the PRO version of the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE). Fisher's exact test was used to examine differences in the proportion of patients reporting individual symptoms. Multivariable linear regression modeling was used to examine group differences in peak symptom burden, while controlling for symptom burden at baseline, age, comorbidity, and transplantation type (autologous or allogeneic). RESULTS: HCT patients receiving the PRO intervention also experienced lower peak symptom burden (average of 16 symptoms) at days +7, +10, and +14 (10.4 vs 14.5, p_=_0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Daily use of electronic symptom reporting to nurses in an inpatient bone marrow transplant clinic reduced peak symptom burden and improved individual symptoms during the 2_weeks post-transplant. A multi-site trial is warranted to demonstrate the generalizability, efficacy, and value of this intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02574897.",,,1,,,
1886,"The Effects of Exercise on Patient-Reported Outcomes and Performance-Based Physical Function in Adults With Acute Leukemia Undergoing Induction Therapy: Exercise and Quality of Life in Acute Leukemia (EQUAL) INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a distressing symptom for adults with acute leukemia, often impeding their ability to exercise. OBJECTIVES: 1) Examine effects of a 4-week mixed-modality supervised exercise program (4 times a week, twice a day) on fatigue in adults with acute leukemia undergoing induction chemotherapy. 2) Evaluate effects of exercise program on cognition, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. 3) Evaluate effect of intervention on adherence to exercise. METHODS: 17 adults (8 intervention, 9 control), aged 28-69 years, newly diagnosed with acute leukemia were recruited within 4 days of admission for induction treatment. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (fatigue, cognition, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, mental health, and physical health) and fitness performance-based measures (Timed Up and Go [TUG], Karnofsky Performance Status, and composite strength scoring) were assessed at baseline and at discharge. Changes in PRO and performance-based physical function measures from baseline to time of discharge were compared between groups using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. RESULTS: With PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Fatigue, we found a median change in fatigue (-5.95) for the intervention group, which achieved a minimally important difference that is considered clinically relevant. Intervention group reduced their TUG performance by 1.73 seconds, whereas the control group remained fairly stable. A concerning finding was that cognition decreased for both groups during their hospitalization. 80% adherence of visits completed with a mean of 6 sessions attended per week.

1887,"Mapping the genetic variation of regional brain volumes as explained by all common SNPs from the ADNI study Typically twin studies are used to investigate the aggregate effects of genetic and environmental influences on brain phenotypic measures. Although some phenotypic measures are highly heritable in twin studies, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for only a small fraction of the heritability of these measures. We mapped the genetic variation (the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by variation among SNPs) of volumes of pre-defined regions across the whole brain, as explained by 512,905 SNPs genotyped on 747 adult participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found that 85% of the variance of intracranial volume (ICV) (p_=_0.04) was explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously, and after adjusting for ICV, total grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes had genetic variation estimates near zero (p_=_0.5). We found varying estimates of genetic variation across 93 non-overlapping regions, with asymmetry in estimates between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Several regions reported in previous studies to be related to Alzheimer's disease progression were estimated to have a large proportion of volumetric variance explained by the SNPs.",,,8,,,
1888,"Perceptions of cardiovascular health in underserved communities Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths and illnesses in US adults, and the prevalence is disproportionately high in underserved populations. In this study, we assessed respondents' understanding of context-specific differences in knowledge and perceptions of disease, risk, and prevention in 6 underserved communities, with the longer-term goal of developing appropriate interventions. Methods: Thirty-nine small-group sessions and 14 interviews yielded data from 318 adults. Each site's researchers coded, analyzed, and extracted key themes from local data. Investigators from all sites synthesized results and identified common themes and differences. Results: Themes clustered in 3 areas (barriers to cardiovascular health, constraints related to multiple roles, and suggestions for effective communications and programs). Barriers spanned individual, social and cultural, and environmental levels; women in particular cited multiple roles (eg, competing demands, lack of self-care). Programmatic suggestions included the following: personal, interactive, social context; information in language that people use; activities built around cultural values and interests; and community orientation. In addition, respondents preferred health-related information from trusted groups (eg, AARP), health care providers (but with noticeable differences of opinion), family and friends, and printed materials. Conclusion: Interventions to decrease barriers to cardiovascular health are needed; these strategies should include family and community context, small groups, interactive methods, culturally sensitive materials, and trusted information sources. New-immigrant communities need culturally and linguistically tailored education before receiving more substantive interventions.",,,2,,,
1889,"Effectiveness of an implementation optimisation intervention aimed at increasing parent engagement in HENRY, a childhood obesity prevention programme - the Optimising Family Engagement in HENRY (OFTEN) trial: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial BACKGROUND: Family-based interventions to prevent childhood obesity depend upon parents' taking action to improve diet and other lifestyle behaviours in their families. Programmes that attract and retain high numbers of parents provide an enhanced opportunity to improve public health and are also likely to be more cost-effective than those that do not. We have developed a theory-informed optimisation intervention to promote parent engagement within an existing childhood obesity prevention group programme, HENRY (Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young). Here, we describe a proposal to evaluate the effectiveness of this optimisation intervention in regard to the engagement of parents and cost-effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: The Optimising Family Engagement in HENRY (OFTEN) trial is a cluster randomised controlled trial being conducted across 24 local authorities (approximately 144 children's centres) which currently deliver HENRY programmes. The primary outcome will be parental enrolment and attendance at the HENRY programme, assessed using routinely collected process data. Cost-effectiveness will be presented in terms of primary outcomes using acceptability curves and through eliciting the willingness to pay for the optimisation from HENRY commissioners. Secondary outcomes include the longitudinal impact of the optimisation, parent-reported infant intake of fruits and vegetables (as a proxy to compliance) and other parent-reported family habits and lifestyle. DISCUSSION: This innovative trial will provide evidence on the implementation of a theory-informed optimisation intervention to promote parent engagement in HENRY, a community-based childhood obesity prevention programme. The findings will be generalisable to other interventions delivered to parents in other community-based environments. This research meets the expressed needs of commissioners, children's centres and parents to optimise the potential impact that HENRY has on obesity prevention. A subsequent cluster randomised controlled pilot trial is planned to determine the practicality of undertaking a definitive trial to robustly evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the optimised intervention on childhood obesity prevention.

1890,"Validity and reliability of the semi-quantitative self-report Home Food Availability Inventory Checklist (HFAI-C) in White and South Asian populations BACKGROUND: Despite interest in the importance of the home food environment and its potential influence on children's diets and social norms, there remain few self-report checklist methods that have been validated against the gold standard of researcher-conducted inventories. This study aimed to assess the criterion validity and reliability of the 'Home Food Availability Inventory Checklist' (HFAI-C), a 39-item checklist including categories of fruit, vegetables, snacks and drinks. METHODS: The HFAI-C was completed by 97 participants of White and Pakistani origin in the UK. Validity was determined by comparing participant-reported HFAI-C responses to data from researcher observations of home food availability using PABAK and weighted kappa statistics. The validity of measuring the amount of items (in addition to presence/absence) available was also determined. Test-retest reliability compared repeated administrations of the HFAI-C using intra-class correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Validity and reliability was fair to moderate overall. For validity, the average category-level PABAK ranged from 0.31 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.37) for vegetables to 0.44 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.49) for fruits. Assessment of the presence/absence of items demonstrated higher validity compared to quantity measurements. Reliability was increased when the HFAI-C was repeated close to the time of the first administration. For example, ICCs for reliability of the measurement of fruits were 0.52 (95%CI: 0.47, 0.56) if re-administered within 5 months, 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.64) within 30 days and 0.97 (95%CI: 0.94, 1.00) if re-administered on the same day. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the HFAI-C demonstrated fair to moderate validity and reliability in a population of White and South Asian participants. This evaluation is consistent with previous work on other checklists in less diverse, more affluent populations. Our research supports the use of the HFAI-C as a useful, albeit imperfect, representation of researcher-conducted inventories. The feasibility of collecting information using the HFAI-C in large, multi-ethnic samples can facilitate examination of home food availability in relation to exposures such as ethnicity and outcomes including behavioural, social and health outcomes. Future work using the HFAI-C could provide important insights into a modifiable influence with potential to impact health.",,,9,,,
1891,"Relationship between home fruit and vegetable availability and infant and maternal dietary intake in African-American families: evidence from the exhaustive home food inventory BACKGROUND: The availability of foods in the home is likely to be related to consumption. We know of no studies that have reported this association in African-American participants, and few studies have examined home food availability using objective methods.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the association between objective measures of fruits and vegetables in the home with reported infant and maternal diet in low-income African Americans.DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was used to compare food availability and dietary intake. The Exhaustive Home Food Availability Inventory used barcode scanning to measure food availability in the home. Maternal and infant diet was assessed by 24-hour recall.SUBJECTS/SETTING: Eighty African-American first-time mother/infant dyads were recruited from Wake and Durham counties in North Carolina.STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Adjusted mean dietary intake of infants and mothers was calculated within tertiles of food and nutrient availability using analysis of variance. The bootstrap method was used to estimate P values and 95% confidence intervals. Models were adjusted for mother's age, household size, shopping and eating-out behavior.RESULTS: Infants and mothers living in homes in the highest tertile of availability of energy, nutrients, and fruits and vegetables tended to have the highest consumption, respectively; however, statistically significant associations were more likely to occur with infant diet than maternal diet. The relationship was strongest for infant consumption of fruit, with an average of 103.3 g consumed by infants who lived in homes in the highest tertile of availability, compared to 42.5 g in those living in homes in the lowest tertile (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Availability of fruits and vegetables in the home was associated with intake of those foods in a sample of African-American mothers and infants. Results support making changes in the home environment as a method of promoting changes in fruit and vegetable intake.Copyright _ 2011 American Dietetic Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Studies have reported conflicting results of the association of a common nonsynonymous variant, E158K (rs2266782), with hypertension. We examined the associations of E158K, along with rare and low frequency exonic variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]< 5%) in FMO3 with hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We included 7,350 European Americans and 2,814 African Americans in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study with exome sequencing of FMO3. The association of FMO3 variants with SBP and DBP was tested using single variant and gene-based tests followed by the replication or interrogation of significant variants in ancestry-specific cohorts based on Bonferroni corrected thresholds. E158K had significant association with higher SBP in African Americans in ARIC (p=0.03), and two low frequency variants had significant association with higher SBP in African Americans (rs200985584, MAF 0.1%, p=0.0003) and European Americans (rs75904274, MAF 1.7%, p=0.006). These associations were not significant with additional samples: E158K in a meta-analysis of SBP of African ancestry (N=30,841, p=0.43) that included ARIC participants and the two low frequency variants in an independent ancestry-specific exome sequencing study of blood pressure (rs200985584, p=0.94; rs75904274, p=0.81). Our study does not support the association of E158K and low frequency variants in FMO3 with blood pressure and demonstrates the importance of replication in genetic studies.",,,8,,,
1893,"Genetic identification of cell types underlying brain complex traits yields insights into the etiology of Parkinson's disease Genome-wide association studies have discovered hundreds of loci associated with complex brain disorders, but it remains unclear in which cell types these loci are active. Here we integrate genome-wide association study results with single-cell transcriptomic data from the entire mouse nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlying brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with projecting excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, Parkinson's disease was genetically associated not only with cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (which include dopaminergic neurons) but also with enteric neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression. Our study provides an important framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain maladies, and reveals an unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson's disease.",,,8,,,
1894,"Germline variation in inflammation-related pathways and risk of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma OBJECTIVE: Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) incidence has risen sharply in Western countries over recent decades. Local and systemic inflammation is considered an important contributor to OA pathogenesis. Established risk factors for OA and its precursor, Barrett's oesophagus (BE), include symptomatic reflux, obesity and smoking. The role of inherited genetic susceptibility remains an area of active investigation. Here, we explore whether germline variation related to inflammatory processes influences susceptibility to BE/OA. DESIGN: We used data from a genomewide association study of 2515 OA cases, 3295 BE cases and 3207 controls. Our analysis included 7863 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 449 genes assigned to five pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX), cytokine signalling, oxidative stress, human leucocyte antigen and nuclear factor-_B. A principal components-based analytic framework was employed to evaluate pathway-level and gene-level associations with disease risk. RESULTS: We identified a significant signal for the COX pathway in relation to BE risk (p=0.0059, false discovery rate q=0.03), and in gene-level analyses found an association with microsomal glutathione-S-transferase 1 (MGST1); (p=0.0005, q=0.005). Assessment of 36 MGST1 SNPs identified 14 variants associated with elevated BE risk (q< 0.05). Four of these were subsequently confirmed (p< 5.5_10-5) in a meta-analysis encompassing an independent set of 1851 BE cases and 3496 controls, and are known strong expression quantitative trait loci for MGST1. Three such variants were associated with similar elevations in OA risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most comprehensive evaluation of inflammation-related germline variation in relation to risk of BE/OA and suggests that variants in MGST1 influence disease susceptibility.

1895,"Integrative post-genome-wide association analysis of CDKN2A and TP53 SNPs and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma Incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) in Western countries has increased markedly in recent decades. Although several risk factors have been identified for EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE), including reflux, Caucasian race, male gender, obesity, and smoking, less is known about the role of inherited genetic variation. Frequent somatic mutations in the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and TP53 were recently reported in EA tumors, while somatic alterations at 9p (CDKN2A) and 17p (TP53) have been implicated as predictors of progression from BE to EA. Motivated by these findings, we used data from a genome-wide association study of 2515 EA cases and 3207 controls to analyze 37 germline single nucleotide polymorphisms at the CDKN2A and TP53 loci. Three CDKN2A polymorphisms were nominally associated (P < 0.05) with reduced risk of EA: rs2518720 C>T [intronic, odds ratio 0.90, P = 0.0121, q = 0.3059], rs3088440 G>A (3'UTR, odds ratio 0.84, P = 0.0186, q = 0.3059), and rs4074785 C>T (intronic, odds ratio 0.85, P = 0.0248, q = 0.3059). None of the TP53 single nucleotide polymorphisms reached nominal significance. Two of the CDKN2A variants identified were also associated with reduced risk of progression from BE to EA, when assessed in a prospective cohort of 408 BE patients: rs2518720 (hazard ratio 0.57, P = 0.0095, q = 0.0285) and rs3088440 (hazard ratio 0.34, P = 0.0368, q = 0.0552). In vitro functional studies of rs3088440, a single nucleotide polymorphism located in the seed sequence of a predicted miR-663b binding site, suggested a mechanism whereby the G>A substitution may attenuate miR-663b-mediated repression of the CDKN2A transcript. This study provides the first evidence that germline variation at the CDKN2A locus may influence EA susceptibility. _ The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

1896,"MiRNA-Related SNPs and Risk of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma and Barrett's Esophagus: Post Genome-Wide Association Analysis in the BEACON Consortium Incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) has increased substantially in recent decades. Multiple risk factors have been identified for EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE), such as reflux, European ancestry, male sex, obesity, and tobacco smoking, and several germline genetic variants were recently associated with disease risk. Using data from the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2,515 EA cases, 3,295 BE cases, and 3,207 controls, we examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that potentially affect the biogenesis or biological activity of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs implicated in post-transcriptional gene regulation, and deregulated in many cancers, including EA. Polymorphisms in three classes of genes were examined for association with risk of EA or BE: miRNA biogenesis genes (157 SNPs, 21 genes); miRNA gene loci (234 SNPs, 210 genes); and miRNA-targeted mRNAs (177 SNPs, 158 genes). Nominal associations (P< 0.05) of 29 SNPs with EA risk, and 25 SNPs with BE risk, were observed. None remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR q>0.50), and we did not find evidence for interactions between variants analyzed and two risk factors for EA/BE (smoking and obesity). This analysis provides the most extensive assessment to date of miRNA-related SNPs in relation to risk of EA and BE. While common genetic variants within components of the miRNA biogenesis core pathway appear unlikely to modulate susceptibility to EA or BE, further studies may be warranted to examine potential associations between unassessed variants in miRNA genes and targets with disease risk.",,,8,,,
1897,"Pediatric norovirus GII.4 infections in Nicaragua, 1999-2015 OBJECTIVES: Investigate clinical and epidemiological factors of pediatric GII.4 norovirus infections in children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in Nicaragua between 1999 and 2015. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data from 1,790 children_7years with AGE from 6 hospitals in Nicaragua (n=538), and 3 community clinics (n=919) and households (n=333) in Le_n, between 1999 and 2015. Moreover, asymptomatic children from community clinics (n=162) and households (n=105) were enrolled. Norovirus was detected by real-time PCR and genotyped by sequencing the N-terminal and shell region of the capsid gene. RESULTS: Norovirus was found in 19% (n=338) and 12% (n=32) of children with and without AGE, respectively. In total, 20 genotypes including a tentatively new genotype were detected. Among children with AGE, the most common genotypes were GII.4 (53%), GII.14 (7%), GII.3 (6%) and GI.3 (6%). In contrast, only one (1.4%) GII.4 was found in asymptomatic children. The prevalence of GII.4 infections was significantly higher in children between 7 and 12months of age. The prevalence of GII.4 was lowest in households (38%), followed by community clinics (50%) and hospitals (75%). Several different GII.4 variants were detected and their emergence followed the global temporal trend. CONCLUSIONS: Overall our study found the predominance of pediatric GII.4 norovirus infections in Nicaragua mostly occurring in children between 7 and 12months of age, implicating GII.4 as the main norovirus vaccine target.

1898,"Risk factors for colorectal cancer in patients with multiple serrated polyps: a cross-sectional case series from genetics clinics BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple serrated polyps are at an increased risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent reports have linked cigarette smoking with the subset of CRC that develops from serrated polyps. The aim of this work therefore was to investigate the association between smoking and the risk of CRC in high-risk genetics clinic patients presenting with multiple serrated polyps. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified 151 Caucasian individuals with multiple serrated polyps including at least 5 outside the rectum, and classified patients into non-smokers, current or former smokers at the time of initial diagnosis of polyposis. Cases were individuals with multiple serrated polyps who presented with CRC. Controls were individuals with multiple serrated polyps and no CRC. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate associations between smoking and CRC with adjustment for age at first presentation, sex and co-existing traditional adenomas, a feature that has been consistently linked with CRC risk in patients with multiple serrated polyps. CRC was present in 56 (37%) individuals at presentation. Patients with at least one adenoma were 4 times more likely to present with CRC compared with patients without adenomas (OR = 4.09; 95%CI 1.27 to 13.14; P = 0.02). For females, the odds of CRC decreased by 90% in current smokers as compared to never smokers (OR = 0.10; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.47; P = 0.004) after adjusting for age and adenomas. For males, there was no relationship between current smoking and CRC. There was no statistical evidence of an association between former smoking and CRC for both sexes. CONCLUSION: A decreased odds for CRC was identified in females with multiple serrated polyps who currently smoke, independent of age and the presence of a traditional adenoma. Investigations into the biological basis for these observations could lead to non-smoking-related therapies being developed to decrease the risk of CRC and colectomy in these patients.",,,3,,,
1899,"Accelerometer-Measured Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity and Incidence Rates of Falls in Older Women OBJECTIVES: To examine whether moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured using accelerometry is associated with incident falls and whether associations differ according to physical function or history of falls. DESIGN: Prospective study with baseline data collection from 2012 to 2014 and 1 year of follow-up. SETTING: Women's Health Initiative participants living in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory women aged 63 to 99 (N = 5,545). MEASUREMENTS: Minutes of MVPA per day measured using an accelerometer, functional status measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), fall risk factors assessed using a questionnaire, fall injuries assessed in a telephone interview, incident falls ascertained from fall calendars. RESULTS: Incident rate ratios (IRRs) revealed greater fall risk in women in the lowest quartile of MVPA compared to those in the highest (IRR = 1.18, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.38), adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, and fall risk factors. Fall rates were not significantly associated with MVPA in women with high SPPB scores (9-12) or one or fewer falls in the previous year, but in women with low SPPB scores (_ 8) or a history of frequent falls, fall rates were higher in women with lower MVPA levels than in those with higher levels (interaction P < .03 and < .001, respectively). Falls in women with MVPA above the median were less likely to involve injuries requiring medical treatment (9.9%) than falls in women with lower MVPA levels (13.0%) (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that falls are not more common or injurious in older women who engage in higher levels of MVPA. These findings support encouraging women to engage in the amounts and types of MVPA that they prefer. Older women with low physical function or frequent falls with low levels of MVPA are a high-risk group for whom vigilance about falls prevention is warranted. _ 2017, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation _ 2017, The American Geriatrics Society.",,,9,,,
1900,"Epidemiology's continuing contribution to public health: The power of ""Then and Now"" The 47th annual meeting of the Society for Epidemiologic Research hosted 17 invited speakers charged by the Executive Committee with presenting some of the many ways that epidemiologists have improved the health of the general population. There were 9 ""Then and Now"" sessions that were structured to focus on how early epidemiologists overcame research hurdles and advanced health through innovative strategies. For most topics, a longstanding expert was paired with an excellent contemporary epidemiologist working in the area, and both were given the freedom to deliver an integrated story about epidemiology's temporal role in protecting and promoting public health. Epidemiologic discoveries in cardiovascular, cancer, and perinatal epidemiology were discussed on day 1, followed by discussions of accomplishments in reducing exposures that adversely impact health (nutrition, environment/occupation, and tobacco use) on day 2. Topics with relevancy for many aspects of epidemiology were presented on day 3, including infectious diseases, social forces, and causal thinking in epidemiologic research. Given the large number of outstanding senior and junior epidemiologists that attended the meeting, choosing speakers was a unique challenge. What became evident from all sessions was the passion that epidemiologists have for population health, tempered with concerns for remaining true to epidemiologic principles, the timely adoption of innovative methods, and the responsible interpretation of research findings.

1901,"Statistical Approaches for Estimating Sex-Specific Effects in Endocrine Disruptors Research BACKGROUND: When a biologic mechanism of interest is anticipated to operate differentially according to sex, as is often the case in endocrine disruptors research, investigators routinely estimate sex-specific associations. Less attention has been given to potential sexual heterogeneity of confounder associations with outcomes. When relationships of covariates with outcomes differ according to sex, commonly applied statistical approaches for estimating sex-specific endocrine disruptor effects may produce divergent estimates. OBJECTIVES: We discuss underlying assumptions and evaluate the performance of two traditional approaches for estimating sex-specific effects, stratification and product terms, and introduce a simple modeling alternative: an augmented product term approach. METHODS: We describe the impact of assumptions regarding sexual heterogeneity of confounder relationships on estimates of sex-specific effects of the exposure of interest for three approaches: stratification, traditional product terms, and augmented product terms. Using simulated and applied examples, we demonstrate properties of each approach under a range of scenarios. RESULTS: In simulations, sex-specific exposure effects estimated using the traditional product term approach were biased when confounders had sex-dependent associations with the outcome. Sex-specific estimates from stratification and the augmented product term approach were unbiased but less precise. In the applied example, the three approaches yielded similar estimates, but resulted in some meaningful differences in conclusions based on statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Investigators should consider sexual heterogeneity of confounder associations when choosing an analytic approach to estimate sex-specific effects of endocrine disruptors on health. In the presence of sex-dependent confounding, our augmented product term approach may be advantageous over stratification when there is prior knowledge available to fit reduced models or when investigators seek an automated test for effect measure modification. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP334.",,,1,,,
1902,"Prenatal Phthalate Exposures and Body Mass Index Among 4- to 7-Year-old Children: A Pooled Analysis BACKGROUND: Phthalates are hypothesized to cause obesity, but few studies have assessed whether prenatal phthalate exposures are related to childhood body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We included 707 children from three prospective cohort studies enrolled in the US between 1998 and 2006 who had maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations measured during pregnancy, and measures of weight and height at ages 4 to 7 years. We calculated age- and sex-standardized BMI z scores and classified children with BMI percentiles _85 as overweight/obese. We used mixed effects regression models to estimate associations between a 1 standard deviation increase in natural log phthalate metabolite concentrations and BMI z scores and overweight/obesity. We estimated associations in multiple metabolite models adjusted for confounders, and evaluated heterogeneity of associations by child's sex, race/ethnicity, and cohort. RESULTS: Mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate concentrations were positively associated with overweight/obese status in children (odds ratio [95% credible interval] = 2.1 [1.2, 4.0]) but not with BMI z scores (_ = -0.02 [-0.15, 0.11]). We did not observe evidence of obesogenic effects for other metabolites. However, monoethyl phthalate and summed di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (__EHP) concentrations were inversely associated with BMI z scores among girls (monoethyl phthalate beta = -0.14 [-0.28, 0.00]; __EHP beta = -0.12 [-0.27, 0.02]). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal urinary mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate, a nonspecific metabolite of several phthalates, was positively associated with childhood overweight/obesity. Metabolites of diethyl phthalate and DEHP were associated with lower BMI in girls but not in boys, suggesting that prenatal exposures may have sexually dimorphic effects on physical development.",,,3,,,
1903,"Prenatal phthalate exposures and childhood fat mass in a new york city cohort BACKGROUND: Experimental animal studies and limited epidemiologic evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to phthalates may be obesogenic, with potential sex-specific effects of phthalates having anti-androgenic activity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess associations between prenatal phthalate exposures and childhood fat mass in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in third-trimester maternal urine in a cohort of women enrolled in New York City between 1998 and 2002 (n = 404). Among 180 children (82 girls and 98 boys), we evaluated body composition using a Tanita scale at multiple follow-up visits between ages 4 and 9 years (363 total visits). We estimated associations of standard deviation differences or tertiles of natural log phthalate metabolite concentrations with percent fat mass using linear mixed-effects regression models with random intercepts for repeated outcome measurements. We assessed associations in multiple metabolite models and adjusted for covariates including prepregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and breastfeeding. RESULTS: We did not observe associations between maternal urinary phthalate concentrations and percent body fat in models examining continuous exposures. Fat mass was 3.06% (95% CI: -5.99, -0.09%) lower among children in the highest tertile of maternal urinary concentrations of summed di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (_DEHP) metabolites than in children in the lowest tertile. Though estimates were imprecise, there was little evidence that associations between maternal urinary phthalate concentrations and percent fat mass were modified by child's sex. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal phthalate exposures were not associated with increased body fat among children 4-9 years of age, though high prenatal DEHP exposure may be associated with lower fat mass in childhood.

1904,"Seasonal modification of the association between temperature and adult emergency department visits for asthma: a case-crossover study BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of temperature on emergency department visits for asthma and modification of this association by season. This association is of interest in its own right, and also important to understand because temperature may be an important confounder in analyses of associations between other environmental exposures and asthma. For example, the case-crossover study design is commonly used to investigate associations between air pollution and respiratory outcomes, such as asthma. This approach controls for confounding by month and season by design, and permits adjustment for potential confounding by temperature through regression modeling. However, such models may fail to adequately control for confounding if temperature effects are seasonal, since case-crossover analyses rarely account for interactions between matching factors (such as calendar month) and temperature. METHODS: We conducted a case-crossover study to determine whether the association between temperature and emergency department visits for asthma varies by season or month. Asthma emergency department visits among North Carolina adults during 2007-2008 were identified using a statewide surveillance system. Marginal as well as season- and month-specific associations between asthma visits and temperature were estimated with conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The association between temperature and adult emergency department visits for asthma is near null when the overall association is examined [odds ratio (OR) per 5 degrees Celsius_=_1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.02]. However, significant variation in temperature-asthma associations was observed by season (chi-square_=_18.94, 3 degrees of freedom, p < 0.001) and by month of the year (chi-square_=_45.46, 11 degrees of freedom, p < 0.001). ORs per 5 degrees Celsius were increased in February (OR_=_1.06, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10), July (OR_=_1.16, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.29), and December (OR_=_1.04, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.07) and decreased in September (OR_=_0.92, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our empirical example suggests that there is significant seasonal variation in temperature-asthma associations. Epidemiological studies rarely account for interactions between ambient temperature and temporal matching factors (such as month of year) in the case-crossover design. These findings suggest that greater attention should be given to seasonal modification of associations between temperature and respiratory outcomes in case-crossover analyses of other environmental asthma triggers.",,,1,,,

Researchers new to these settings frequently lack the skills and specialized knowledge conducive to multi-site and multi-disciplinary research set in delivery systems. This report describes the goals and components of the Cancer Research Network (CRN) Scholars Program, a 26-month training program developed to increase the capacity for cancer research conducted within the network's participating sites, its progression from training embedded investigators to a mix of internal and external investigators, and the content evolution of the training program. The CRN Scholars program was launched in 2007 to assist junior investigators from member sites develop independent and sustainable research programs within the CRN. Resulting from CRN's increased emphasis on promoting external collaborations, the 2013 Scholars program began recruiting junior investigators from external institutions committed to conducting delivery system science. Based on involvement of this broader population and feedback from prior Scholar cohorts, the program has honed its focus on specific opportunities and issues encountered in conducting cancer research within health care delivery systems. Efficiency and effectiveness of working within networks is accelerated by strategic and mentored navigation of these networks. Investing in training programs specific to these settings provides the opportunity to improve multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration, particularly for early-stage investigators. Aspects of the CRN Scholars Program may help inform others considering developing similar programs to expand delivery system research or within large, multi-disciplinary research networks.",,,2,,,
1907,"Characterizing the HIV care continuum and identifying barriers and facilitators to HIV diagnosis and viral suppression among black transgender women in the united states BACKGROUND: Although black transgender women (BTW) experience high prevalence of HIV in the United States, no characterization of the HIV care continuum exists for this population. This study addresses this gap by (1) characterizing the HIV care continuum, and (2) exploring correlates of HIV diagnosis and viral suppression among a community-based sample of BTW. METHODS: Data came from Promoting Our Worth, Equality, and Resilience (POWER). From 2014 to 2017, POWER recruited BTW who attended Black Pride events in 6 U.S. cities. Participants completed a behavioral health survey and were offered onsite HIV testing. Simple frequencies were used to characterize the HIV care continuum, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify correlates of HIV diagnosis and viral suppression. RESULTS: A total of 422 BTW provided completed data for our analysis, 45.0% of whom were living with HIV. Over half of the HIV-positive BTW (51.4%) reported being undiagnosed at the time of survey, and 24.5% reported viral suppression. Incarceration and a lack of access to medical care were significantly and positively associated with an undiagnosed HIV-positive status in multivariable models. Incarceration, homelessness, polydrug use, physical assault, intimate partner violence, and current hormone use were significantly and negatively associated with viral suppression in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: Developing and implementing interventions that address timely HIV diagnosis may assist in informing the HIV disparity among BTW in the United States. Interventions should address the fundamental causes of poor health in this population.",,,6,,,

1915,"Reconceptualizing anorexia nervosa Anorexia nervosa (AN) has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder. Treatments are often ineffective and relapse is common. Most research attempting to understand the underlying causes and maintenance factors of AN has focused on environmental contributions, yet there is much to be explored in terms of biological risk and maintenance factors. In this paper, we focus primarily on AN research related to genetics and the complex microbial community in the gut (intestinal microbiota), and how these impact our conceptualization of this disorder. Emerging research identifying significant negative genetic correlations between AN and obesity suggests that the conditions may represent 'metabolic bookends'. The identification of underlying biological mechanisms may provide both insight into extreme weight dysregulation on both ends of the spectrum and new possible points of entry for AN treatment. Additionally, the reported microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiota in AN patients, potentially due to a nutrient- and energy-deprived gut environment, implies alterations in functional and metabolic capacity of the gut microbiome. The extent to which AN and obesity can also be considered to be 'microbiome bookends' requires further investigation. Finally, we discuss ongoing and future AN projects exploring the interplay between host genomics, the environment, and cumulative microbial genomes (microbiome) as well as interventions at the microbial and gut level. _ 2019 The Authors.

As analytic techniques evolve for twin, population, and molecular genetic studies, new findings emerge at an accelerated pace. We present the current status of knowledge regarding the role of genetic and environmental factors that influence risk for eating disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: We focus on novel findings from twin studies, population studies using genetically informative designs, and molecular genetic studies. Over the past 2 years, research in this area has yielded insights into: comorbidity with other psychiatric and medical disorders and with metabolic traits; developmental factors associated with the emergence of eating disorders; and the molecular genetics of anorexia nervosa. SUMMARY: Insights from genetic epidemiology provide an important explanatory model for patients with eating disorders, family members, and clinicians. Understanding core biological determinants that explain the severity and persistence of the illnesses, their frequent co-occurrence with other conditions, and their familial patterns raises awareness and increases compassion for individuals living with these disorders. Large-scale genomic studies are currently underway. Ultimately, this domain of research may pave the way to greater understanding of the underlying neurobiology and inform the development of novel and effective interventions.",,,1,,,
1917,"CBT4BN versus CBTF2F: comparison of online versus face-to-face treatment for bulimia nervosa Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is currently the ""gold standard"" for treatment of bulimia nervosa (BN), and is effective for approximately 40-60% of individuals receiving treatment; however, the majority of individuals in need of care do not have access to CBT. New strategies for service delivery of CBT and for maximizing maintenance of treatment benefits are critical for improving our ability to treat BN. This clinical trial is comparing an Internet-based version of CBT (CBT4BN) in which group intervention is conducted via therapeutic chat group with traditional group CBT (CBTF2F) for BN conducted via face-to-face therapy group. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether manualized CBT delivered via the Internet is not inferior to the gold standard of manualized group CBT. In this two-site randomized controlled trial, powered for non-inferiority analyses, 180 individuals with BN are being randomized to either CBT4BN or CBTF2F. We hypothesize that CBT4BN will not be inferior to CBTF2F and that participants will value the convenience of an online intervention. If not inferior, CBT4BN may be a cost-effective approach to service delivery for individuals requiring treatment for BN. Copyright _ 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,5,,,
1918,"Eating Disorders Genetic factors have a substantial role in liability to the primary eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. However, environmental factors and gene__nvironment co-action are also posited to contribute. Research into fundamental aspects of these disorders has the potential to inform all disorders of weight and appetite dysregulation as well as an array of related neuropsychiatric conditions. Neural circuit maladaptation that contributes to eating disorders can readily be studied at the basic science level using animal models. Each new discovery of pathways involved in eating initiation, maintenance, and cessation further advances our understanding of the mechanisms that may have a role in grossly dysregulated appetite and weight. Advancing our understanding of these conditions requires enhanced cross-talk in diverse fields including psychiatry, metabolomics, genetics, and neuroscience and between basic and clinical researchers.",,,7,,,
1919,"Understanding the relation between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in a Swedish national twin sample BACKGROUND: We present a bivariate twin analysis of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa to determine the extent to which shared genetic and environmental factors contribute to liability to these disorders. METHOD: Focusing on females from the Swedish Twin study of Adults: Genes and Environment (n = 7000), we calculated heritability estimates for narrow and broad anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and estimated their genetic correlation. RESULTS: In the full model, the heritability estimate for narrow anorexia nervosa (AN) was (a(2) = .57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .00-.81) and for narrow bulimia nervosa (BN) (a(2) = .62; 95% CI: .08-.70), with the remaining variance accounted for by unique environmental factors. Shared environmental factors estimates were (c(2) = .00; 95% CI: .00-.67) for AN and (c(2) = .00; 95% CI: .00-.40) for BN. Moderate additive genetic (.46) and unique environmental (.42) correlations between AN and BN were observed. Heritability estimates for broad AN were lower (a(2) = .29; 95% CI: .04-.43) than for narrow AN, but estimates for broad BN were similar to narrow BN. The genetic correlation for broad AN and BN was .79, and the unique environmental correlation was .44. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the contribution of additive genetic factors to both narrow and broad AN and BN and demonstrate a moderate overlap of both genetic and unique environmental factors that influence the two conditions. Common concurrent and sequential comorbidity of AN and BN can in part be accounted for by shared genetic and environmental influences on liability although independent factors also operative.",,,1,,,
1920,"Predictors of toxic metal exposures among US women of reproductive age BACKGROUND: Arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury are ubiquitous toxicants that may be especially harmful to unborn children. We therefore sought to identify temporal trends and predictors of toxic metal biomarkers among US women of reproductive age, including those who were pregnant and/or breastfeeding. METHODS: Interviews and examinations were performed among a representative sample of women, aged 20-44 years, as part of the 2003-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. A range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors were evaluated as predictors of urinary inorganic arsenic, urinary cadmium, blood mercury, and blood lead concentrations. RESULTS: Levels of all four toxic metal biomarkers declined during the study period. Older age, racial/ethnic minorities, and a birthplace outside of the US were independently associated with higher toxic metal concentrations. Associations were similar for women who were pregnant or breastfeeding and those who were not. CONCLUSION: US women of reproductive age were exposed to lower levels of toxic metals in 2013-2014 compared to 2003-2004. However, because the long-term health effects of early life exposures are unclear, public health efforts to address toxic metals should pay particular attention to older, nonwhite, and foreign-born women if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.",,,6,,,
1921,"Placental cpg methylation of inflammation, angiogenic, and neurotrophic genes and retinopathy of prematurity Purpose: Extremely preterm infants are at increased risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We previously identified several inflammatory proteins that were expressed early in life and are associated with an increased risk of ROP and several angiogenic and neurotrophic growth factors in the neonatal systemic circulation that are associated with a lower risk of ROP. In this paper, we report the results of a set of analyses designed to test the hypothesis that placental CpG methylation levels of 12 inflammation-, angiogenic-, and neurotrophic-associated genes predict the occurrence of prethreshold ROP in extremely preterm newborns. Methods: We used placental CpG methylation data from 395 newborns from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns study. Results: Multivariable regression models revealed that placental DNA methylation of 16 CpG sites representing 8 genes were associated with prethreshold ROP. Specifically, CpG methylation in the serum amyloid A SAA1 and SAA2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), myeloperoxidase (MPO), C-reactive protein (CRP), angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1B (TNFRSF1B) genes was associated with a lower risk of prethreshold ROP. Conversely, CpG methylation at three probes within tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A) and in two alternative probes within the BDNF and ANGPT1 genes was associated with an increased risk of ROP. Conclusions: CpG methylation may be a useful marker for improving ROP prediction, opening the opportunity for early intervention to lessen disease severity.",,,3,,,
1922,"Occupational Exposures and Metabolic Syndrome Among Hispanics/Latinos: Cross-Sectional Results From the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) OBJECTIVE: We assessed the cross-sectional relationships of self-reported current occupational exposures to solvents, metals, and pesticides with metabolic syndrome and its components among 7127 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. METHODS: Metabolic syndrome was defined as a clustering of abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high blood pressure, and/or high fasting glucose. Regression models that incorporated inverse probability of exposure weighting were used to estimate prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Solvent exposure was associated with a 32% higher prevalence of high blood pressure (95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.60) than participants not reporting exposure. No associations were observed for occupational exposures with abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein, or metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that solvent exposure may be an important occupational risk factor for high blood pressure among Hispanics/Latinos in the United States.",,,9,,,
1923,"The effects of healthy aging on intracerebral blood vessels visualized by magnetic resonance angiography Histological and magnetic resonance imaging studies have demonstrated that age-associated alterations of the human brain may be at least partially related to vascular alterations. Relatively little information has been published on vascular changes associated with healthy aging, however. The study presented in this paper examined vessels segmented from standardized, high-resolution, magnetic resonance angiograms (MRAs) of 100 healthy volunteers (50 males, 50 females), aged 18-74, without hypertension or other disease likely to affect the vasculature. The subject sample was divided into 5 age groups (n=20/group) with gender equally distributed per group. The anterior cerebral, both middle cerebral, and the posterior circulations were examined for vessel number, vessel radius, and vessel tortuosity. Males exhibited larger vessel radii regardless of age and across all anatomical regions. Both males and females displayed a lower number of MRA-discernible vessels with age, most marked in the posterior circulation. Age-associated tortuosity increases were relatively mild. Our multi-modal image database has been made publicly available for use by other investigators.",,,1,,,
1924,"Prevention of physical training-related injuries recommendations for the military and other active populations based on expedited systematic reviews BACKGROUND: The Military Training Task Force of the Defense Safety Oversight Council chartered a Joint Services Physical Training Injury Prevention Working Group to: (1) establish the evidence base for making recommendations to prevent injuries; (2) prioritize the recommendations for prevention programs and policies; and (3) substantiate the need for further research and evaluation on interventions and programs likely to reduce physical training-related injuries. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A work group was formed to identify, evaluate, and assess the level of scientific evidence for various physical training-related injury prevention strategies through an expedited systematic review process. Of 40 physical training-related injury prevention strategies identified, education, leader support, and surveillance were determined to be essential elements of a successful injury prevention program and not independent interventions. As a result of the expedited systematic reviews, one more essential element (research) was added for a total of four. Six strategies were not reviewed. The remaining 31 interventions were categorized into three levels representing the strength of recommendation: (1) recommended; (2) not recommended; and (3) insufficient evidence to recommend or not recommend. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Education, leadership support, injury surveillance, and research were determined to be critical components of any successful injury prevention program. Six interventions (i.e., prevent overtraining, agility-like training, mouthguards, semirigid ankle braces, nutrient replacement, and synthetic socks) had strong enough evidence to become working group recommendations for implementation in the military services. Two interventions (i.e., back braces and pre-exercise administration of anti-inflammatory medication) were not recommended due to evidence of ineffectiveness or harm, 23 lacked sufficient scientific evidence to support recommendations for all military services at this time, and six were not evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Six interventions should be implemented in all four military services immediately to reduce physical training-related injuries. Two strategies should be discouraged by all leaders at all levels. Of particular note, 23 popular physical training-related injury prevention strategies need further scientific investigation, review, and group consensus before they can be recommended to the military services or similar civilian populations. The expedited systematic process of evaluating interventions enabled the working group to build consensus around those injury prevention strategies that had enough scientific evidence to support a recommendation.

1925,"Availability of farmers_ markets and supplemental nutrition assistance program/electronic benefit transfer systems and associations with rurality, poverty, race/ethnicity, and obesity among north carolina counties Increasing the number of farmers_ markets and implementing Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) systems for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at more farmers_ markets have been suggested as strategies to overcome food access issues, but little is known about their availability in the rural South. This study examines differences in availability of farmers_ markets and SNAP/EBT at markets by county-level rural/urban classification, percentage poverty, percentage racial/ethnic minority, and percentage obese residents in North Carolina counties. Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey. Though results related to rurality and economic status are mixed, regression analyses indicate that the percentage of African American residents is inversely associated with the number of markets and number of markets that accept EBT. Results suggest that access to farmers_ markets varies in North Carolina, and additional research is needed to determine whether this impacts obesity.",,,2,,,
1926,"Elucidating the influence of supervisors' roles on implementation climate BACKGROUND: Supervisors play an essential role in implementation by diffusing and synthesizing information, selling implementation, and translating top management's project plans to frontline workers. Theory and emerging evidence suggest that through these roles, supervisors shape implementation climate-i.e., the degree to which innovations are expected, supported, and rewarded. However, it is unclear exactly how supervisors carry out each of these roles in ways that contribute to implementation climate-this represents a gap in the understanding of the causal mechanisms that link supervisors' behavior with implementation climate. This study examined how supervisors' performance of each of these roles influences three core implementation climate domains (expectations, supports, and rewards). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sequenced behavioral health screening, assessment, and referral intervention was implemented within a county-based child welfare agency. We conducted 6 focus groups with supervisors and frontline workers from implementing work units 6_months post-implementation (n_=_51) and 1_year later (n_=_40) (12 groups total). Participants were asked about implementation determinants, including supervision and implementation context. We audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed focus groups using an open coding process during which the importance of the supervisors' roles emerged as a major theme. We further analyzed this code using concepts and definitions related to middle managers' roles and implementation climate. RESULTS: In this work setting, supervisors (1) diffused information about the intervention proactively, and in response to workers' questions, (2) synthesized information by tailoring it to workers' individual needs, (3) translated top managements' project plans into day-to-day tasks through close monitoring and reminders, and (4) justified implementation. All four of these roles appeared to shape the implementation climate by conveying strong expectations for implementation. Three roles (diffusing, synthesizing, and mediating) influenced climate by supporting workers during implementation. Only one role (diffusing) influenced climate by conveying rewards. CONCLUSIONS: Supervisors shaped implementation climate by carrying out four roles (diffusing, synthesizing, mediating, and selling). Findings suggest that the interaction of these roles convey expectations and support for implementation (two implementation climate domains). Our study advances the causal theory explaining how supervisors' behavior shapes the implementation climate, which can inform implementation practice.",,,7,,,
1927,"Advice-seeking during implementation: a network study of clinicians participating in a learning collaborative BACKGROUND: Successful implementation depends on the transfer of knowledge and expertise among clinicians, which can occur when professionals seek advice from one another. This study examines advice-seeking patterns among mental health clinicians participating in learning collaboratives (a multi-component implementation and quality improvement strategy) to implement trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). We apply transactive memory system theory, which explains how professionals access and retrieve knowledge, to examine factors associated with the evolution of advice-seeking relationships during implementation. Our aim is to unpack learning collaboratives' mechanisms by investigating how and why advice-seeking networks change, which may help us understand how implementation strategies can best target networks. METHODS: Using social network analysis and a pretest-post-test design, we examined patterns in general and treatment-specific advice-seeking among 146 participants (including five clinical experts) from 27 agencies participating in a regional scale-up of TF-CBT. Surveys were administered in-person at the first and last of three in-person learning sessions (10_months apart) that comprise a core component of learning collaboratives. Participants nominated up to five individuals from whom they seek general and treatment-specific advice. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) tested the likelihood of maintaining or forming advice-seeking relationships based on indicators of expertise quality, accessibility, need, and prior advice-seeking relationships. RESULTS: Participants formed or maintained advice-seeking relationships with those who possess perceived expertise (e.g., learning collaborative faculty experts, supervisors, and those with greater field experience than themselves). Participants also tended to seek advice from those within the same organization and with similar disciplinary training, highlighting the importance of expertise accessibility. Prior relationships and network structural features were associated with advice-seeking, indicating that participants built on existing social ties. Advice-seeking did not vary based on participants' role or experience. CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of accessible clinical expertise and ongoing supervision for delivering treatment with fidelity, learning collaboratives may support implementation by promoting clinicians' awareness of and access to others' expertise, especially those with substantial expertise to share (e.g., faculty experts and supervisors). Future controlled studies are needed to verify the effectiveness of learning collaboratives for building networks that connect clinicians and experts and for improving implementation.",,,2,,,
1928,"Tracking implementation strategies: a description of a practical approach and early findings BACKGROUND: Published descriptions of implementation strategies often lack precision and consistency, limiting replicability and slowing accumulation of knowledge. Recent publication guidelines for implementation strategies call for improved description of the activities, dose, rationale and expected outcome(s) of strategies. However, capturing implementation strategies with this level of detail can be challenging, as responsibility for implementation is often diffuse and strategies may be flexibly applied as barriers and challenges emerge. We describe and demonstrate the development and application of a practical approach to identifying implementation strategies used in research and practice that could be used to guide their description and specification. METHODS: An approach to tracking implementation strategies using activity logs completed by project personnel was developed to facilitate identification of discrete strategies. This approach was piloted in the context of a multi-component project to improve children's access to behavioural health services in a county-based child welfare agency. Key project personnel completed monthly activity logs that gathered data on strategies used over 17_months. Logs collected information about implementation activities, intent, duration and individuals involved. Using a consensus approach, two sets of coders categorised each activity based upon Powell et al.'s (Med Care Res Rev 69:123-57, 2012) taxonomy of implementation strategies. RESULTS: Participants reported on 473 activities, which represent 45 unique strategies. Initial implementation was characterised by planning strategies followed by educational strategies. After project launch, quality management strategies predominated, suggesting a progression of implementation over time. Together, these strategies accounted for 1594 person-hours, many of which were reported by the leadership team that was responsible for project design, implementation and oversight. CONCLUSIONS: This approach allows for identifying discrete implementation strategies used over time, estimating dose, describing temporal ordering of implementation strategies, and pinpointing the major implementation actors. This detail could facilitate clear reporting of a full range of implementation strategies, including those that may be less observable. This approach could lead to a more nuanced understanding of what it takes to implement different innovations, the types of strategies that are most useful during specific phases of implementation, and how implementation strategies need to be adaptively applied throughout the course of a given initiative.",,,7,,,

1930,"Assessing the impact of air pollution on childhood asthma morbidity: how, when, and what to do PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Exposure to air pollutants is linked with poor asthma control in children and represents a potentially modifiable risk factor for impaired lung function, rescue medication use, and increased asthma-related healthcare utilization. Identification of the most relevant pollutants to asthma as well as susceptibility factors and strategies to reduce exposure are needed to improve child health. RECENT FINDINGS: The current available literature supports the association between pollutants and negative asthma outcomes. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and presence of certain gene polymorphisms may impact susceptibility to the negative health effects of air pollution. Improved air quality standards were associated with better asthma outcomes. SUMMARY: The link between air pollution and pediatric asthma morbidity is supported by the recent relevant literature. Continued efforts are needed to identify the most vulnerable populations and develop strategies to reduce exposures and improve air quality.",,,1,,,

1932,"Environmental determinants of allergy and asthma in early life Allergic disease prevalence has increased significantly in recent decades. Primary prevention efforts are being guided by study of the exposome (or collective environmental exposures beginning during the prenatal period) to identify modifiable factors that affect allergic disease risk. In this review we explore the evidence supporting a relationship between key components of the external exposome in the prenatal and early-life periods and their effect on atopy development focused on microbial, allergen, and air pollution exposures. The abundance and diversity of microbial exposures during the first months and years of life have been linked with risk of allergic sensitization and disease. Indoor environmental allergen exposure during early life can also affect disease development, depending on the allergen type, dose, and timing of exposure. Recent evidence supports the role of ambient air pollution in allergic disease inception. The lack of clarity in the literature surrounding the relationship between environment and atopy reflects the complex interplay between cumulative environmental factors and genetic susceptibility, such that no one factor dictates disease development in all subjects. Understanding the effect of the summation of environmental exposures throughout a child's development is needed to identify cost-effective interventions that reduce atopy risk in children.

1933,"Age and African-American race impact the validity and reliability of the asthma control test in persistent asthmatics BACKGROUND: The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is widely used to assess asthma control, yet the validity and reliability of the test have not been specifically evaluated in adolescents or African-Americans. We conducted a prospective psychometric study of the ACT in African-American (AA) and non-African-American (nAA) adolescents with persistent asthma, with emphasis on the clinical utility of the test for medical decision making. METHODS: Participants completed the ACT and performed spirometry. A physician conducted a guidelines-based assessment of asthma control, blinded to the ACT score. Study procedures were repeated 6-8_weeks later. The ACT-based asthma control assessment was compared to physician assessment. RESULTS: For baseline and follow-up visits, internal consistency, as measured using Cronbach's alpha, was 0.80 and 0.81 in AA teens and 0.80 and 0.83 in nAA teens. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.59 and 0.76 in AA and nAA teens, respectively, with stable asthma control over time. Agreement between ACT and physician assessment was moderate in AA teens and fair in nAA teens. An ACT score of _19 showed reduced sensitivity for not well controlled asthma in both groups, while a score of _21 had the greatest area under the ROC curve. ACT scores were marginally responsive to change in control status. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns for the ACT's ability to detect uncontrolled asthma in adolescents emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of asthma control in clinical settings. A higher threshold ACT score to define not well controlled asthma may be needed if the ACT is to be used for medical decision making.

1935,"Detection of human immunodeficiency virus RNAs in living cells using Spinach RNA aptamers Many techniques currently used to measure HIV RNA production in cells suffer from limitations that include high background signal or the potential to destroy cellular context. Fluorophore-binding RNA aptamers offer the potential for visualizing RNAs directly in living cells with minimal cellular perturbation. We inserted a sequence encoding a fluorophore-binding RNA aptamer, known as Spinach, into the HIV genome such that predicted RNA secondary structures in both Spinach and HIV were preserved. Chimeric HIV-Spinach RNAs were functionally validated in vitro by testing their ability to enhance the fluorescence of a conditional fluorophore (DFHBI), which specifically binds Spinach. Fluorescence microscopy and PCR were used to verify expression of HIV-Spinach RNAs in human cells. HIV-1 gag RNA production and fluorescence were measured by qPCR and fluorometry, respectively. HIV-Spinach RNAs were fluorometrically detectable in vitro and were transcribed in human cell lines and primary cells, with both spliced and unspliced species detected by PCR. HIV-Spinach RNAs were visible by fluorescence microscopy in living cells, although signal was reproducibly weak. Cells expressing HIV-Spinach RNAs were capable of producing fluorometrically detectable virions, although detection of single viral particles was not possible. In summary, we have investigated a novel method for detecting HIV RNAs in living cells using the Spinach RNA aptamer. Despite the limitations of the present aptamer/fluorophore combination, this is the first application of this technology to an infectious disease and provides a foundation for future research into improved methods for studying HIV expression.

1936,"Brain-based etiology of weight regulation Caloric intake and energy balance are highly regulated to maintain metabolic homeostasis and weight. However, hedonic-motivated food intake, in particular consumption of highly rewarding foods, may act to override hemostatic signaling and contribute to overconsumption, weight gain, and obesity. Here, we review human neuroimaging literature that has delivered valuable insight into the neural correlates of hedonic-motivated ingestive behavior, weight gain, weight loss, and metabolic status. Our primary focus is the brain regions that are thought to encode aspects of food hedonics, gustatory and somatosensory processing, and executive functioning. Further, we discuss the variability of regional brain response as a function of obesity, weight gain, behavioral and surgical weight loss, as well as in type 2 diabetes.",,,4,,,
1937,"The Association between the History of HIV Diagnosis and Oral Health Unmet oral care needs are high among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS (PLWH). Oral health care is of increasing importance as life expectancy is being prolonged extensively among PLWH. The benefit of oral health care in relation to time since HIV diagnosis has not previously been assessed. A retrospective multivariable analysis of the Special Project of National Significance Oral Health Initiative observational cohort study ( N = 2,178) was performed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of oral health outcomes comparing historically diagnosed subjects (>1 y since HIV diagnosis) to newly diagnosed subjects (_1 y since HIV diagnosis). ORs were adjusted for age, study site, language, income, last dental care visit, and dental insurance. Historically diagnosed subjects were more likely to report oral problems than newly HIV-diagnosed subjects (OR, 2.10). Historically diagnosed subjects were more likely to require oral surgery (OR, 1.52), restorative treatment (OR, 1.35), endodontic treatment (OR, 1.63), and more than 10 oral clinic visits over the 24-mo study period (OR, 2.02). The crude cumulative 2-y risk of requiring prosthetic (risk difference [RD], 0.21) and endodontic (RD, 0.11) treatment was higher among historically than newly diagnosed subjects, despite no significance postadjustment. Furthermore, poor oral health outcomes were exacerbated among non-highly active antiretroviral therapy users. Summarizing, the authors found that historically diagnosed subjects were more likely to report oral problems and require dental procedures compared with newly diagnosed subjects, suggesting that oral health among PLWH declines over time since HIV diagnosis. Hence, newly diagnosed PLWH may benefit from the implementation of early oral interventions.",,,6,,,
1938,"Propensity score weighting: an application to an Early Head Start dental study OBJECTIVES: Nonrandomized group assignment in intervention studies can lead to imbalances in preintervention covariates and biased effect estimates. We use propensity score estimation to account for such imbalances in an Early Head Start (EHS) dataset with rich pretreatment information. We compare propensity score results using standard logistic regression models (LRMs) versus generalized boosted models (GBMs). METHODS: We estimated propensity scores using 47 socio-demographic characteristics and EHS enrollment criteria obtained by parent interviews from a state-wide sample of 637 EHS and 930 Medicaid-matched control children. LRMs and GBMs were used to estimate propensity scores related to EHS enrollment. Performance of both approaches was evaluated via a) measures of balance of pretreatment covariate distributions between treated and control subjects, and b) stability of propensity score weights measured by the effective sample size. RESULTS: Distributions of all variables were balanced for EHS and non-EHS groups using propensity score weights calculated with LRM and GBM. Compared with LRM, GBM resulted in better balance between treated and propensity score-weighted control distributions. The effective sample size of the controls decreased from 930 subjects to 507 with GBM and to 335 with LRM. CONCLUSION: Although propensity scores derived from GBM and LRM both effectively balanced observed preintervention covariates, GBM resulted in better covariate balance compared with LRM. GBM also resulted in a larger effective sample size of the control group compared with LRM. Propensity score weighting using GBM is an effective statistical method to reduce confounding due to imbalanced distributions of measured preintervention covariates in this EHS intervention study. _ 2015 American Association of Public Health Dentistry.",,,1,,,
1939,"Access to preventive services after the integration of oral health care into early childhood education and medical care BACKGROUND: The effect of Early Head Start (EHS) on receipt of preventive oral health services (POHS) from both oral and medical health care providers is not known. METHODS: The authors compared children enrolled in North Carolina EHS programs with similar children enrolled in Medicaid but not EHS on the use of POHS. They analyzed 4 dependent variables (oral assessment by medical health care provider, oral assessment by oral health care provider, fluoride application by medical health care provider, fluoride application by oral health care provider) by using multivariate logistic regression that controlled for covariates. RESULTS: Primary caregivers of children enrolled in EHS (n_= 479) and Medicaid (n_= 699) were interviewed when children were approximately 10 and 36 months of age. An average of 81% of EHS and non-EHS children received POHS from an oral or medical health care provider at follow-up. EHS children had greater odds of receiving an oral health assessment (odds ratio [OR], 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.74 to 3.13) and fluoride (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.03) from an oral health care provider than children not enrolled. EHS children had decreased odds (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99) of receiving fluoride from a medical health care provider. CONCLUSIONS: Both children enrolled in EHS and community control participants had high rates of POHS, but the source of services differed. EHS children had greater odds of receiving POHS from oral health care providers than non-EHS children. EHS and non-EHS children had equal rates for fluoride overall because of the greater percentage of non-EHS children with medical fluoride visits. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The integration of POHS in early education and Medicaid medical benefits combined with existing dental resources in the community greatly improves access to POHS.

1940,"Enrollment in early head start and oral health-related quality of life PURPOSE: Dental problems in young children are widespread and can negatively impact quality of life. We examined the effect of enrollment in North Carolina Early Head Start (EHS)-a federally funded early education program for children under three years of age and their families-on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, we interviewed 479 EHS and 699 Medicaid matched parent-child dyads at baseline (children's average age 10_months) and 24_months later. Parents reported OHRQoL using the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS), a 0-52 point scale with higher scores representing more negative impacts. We used a marginalized semicontinuous two-part model to estimate: (1) the effect of EHS on the probability of reporting any follow-up impacts (ECOHIS___1), and (2) the difference in overall mean ECOHIS follow-up scores. We controlled for baseline ECOHIS, language, and EHS and non-EHS group imbalances using a propensity score. RESULTS: At follow-up, negative OHRQoL impacts were more often reported by parents of non-EHS than EHS children (45 versus 37%, P_< _.01). In the adjusted model, EHS parents reported a lower odds of negative OHRQoL impacts (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52, 0.94). Mean adjusted ECOHIS scores were not significantly different (EHS: 1.59___3.34 versus non-EHS: 2.11___3.85, P_>_0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that families of young children enrolled in EHS report improved OHRQoL compared to their non-enrolled peers. These results highlight the potential effectiveness of improving the quality of life of low-resource families through early childhood education.",,,1,,,

METHODS: We performed a quasi-experimental study in which we interviewed 479 EHS and 699 non-EHS parent-child dyads at baseline (2010-2012) and at a 24-month follow-up (2012-2014). We estimated the effects of EHS participation on the probability of having a dental care visit after controlling for baseline dental care need and use and a propensity score covariate; we included random effects to account for EHS program clustering. RESULTS: The odds of having a dental care visit of any type (adjusted odds ratio [OR]_=_2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]_=_1.74, 3.48) and having a preventive dental visit (adjusted OR_=_2.6; 95% CI_=_1.84, 3.63) were higher among EHS children than among non-EHS children. In addition, the adjusted mean number of dental care visits among EHS children was 1.3 times (95% CI_=_1.17, 1.55) the mean number among non-EHS children. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that EHS participation increases dental care use among disadvantaged young children.",,,6,,,
1942,"Absence of a moderating effect of parent health literacy on Early Head Start enrollment and dental use OBJECTIVES: To examine the moderating effect of parents' health literacy (HL) on the effectiveness of North Carolina Early Head Start (EHS) in improving children's dental use. METHODS: Parents of 479 children enrolled in EHS and 699 Medicaid-matched parent-child dyads were interviewed at baseline when children were approximately 10 months old and 24 months later. We used in-person computer-assisted, structured interviews to collect information on sociodemographic characteristics, dental use, and administer the Short Assessment of Health Literacy - Spanish and English (SAHL-S&E). This quasi-experimental study tested whether the interaction effect between EHS and parents' HL was associated with dental use. Logit (any use) and marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial count models (number of dental visits) included random effects to account for clustering and controlled for baseline dental use, dental need, survey language, and a propensity score covariate. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of parents in EHS had low literacy compared to 12 percent of parents in the non-EHS group (P_< _0.01). The interaction term between EHS and parent's HL was not significant in the adjusted logit model (ratio of aORs 0.98, 95 percent CI: 0.43-2.20) or the adjusted count model (ratio of aRRs 0.88, 95 percent CI: 0.72-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Parents in EHS had a higher prevalence of low HL compared to non-EHS parents. Parents' HL did not moderate the relationship between EHS and child dental use, suggesting that EHS results in similar improvements in dental use regardless of parent's HL levels. _ 2018 American Association of Public Health Dentistry.",,,1,,,
1943,"Early Head Start, Pediatric Dental Use, and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life The objective of the study was to examine the mediating effect of child dental use on the effectiveness of North Carolina Early Head Start (EHS) in improving oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). In total, 479 parents of children enrolled in EHS and 699 parents of Medicaid-matched children were interviewed at baseline when children were approximately 10 mo old and 24 mo later. In this quasi-experimental study, mediation analysis was performed using the counterfactual framework analysis, which employed 2 logit models with random effects: 1) for the mediator as a function of the treatment and covariates and 2) for the outcome as a function of the treatment, mediator, and covariates. The covariates were baseline dental OHRQoL, dental need, survey language, and a propensity score. We used in-person computer-assisted, structured interviews to collect information on demographic characteristics and dental use and to administer the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale, a measure of OHRQoL. Dental use had a mediation effect in the undesired direction with a 2-percentage point increase in the probability of any negative impact to OHRQoL (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3%-3.9%). Even with higher dental use by EHS participants, the probability of any negative impact to OHRQoL was approximately 8 percentage points lower if an individual were moved from the non-EHS group to the EHS group (95% CI, -13.9% to -1.2%). EHS increases child dental use, which worsens family OHRQoL. However, EHS is associated with improved OHRQoL overall. Knowledge Transfer Statement: Study results can inform policy makers that comprehensive early childhood education programs improve oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) for disadvantaged families with young children in pathways outside of clinical dental care. This awareness and its promotion can lead to greater resource investments in early childhood education programs. Information about the negative impacts of dental use on OHRQoL should lead to the development and testing of strategies in dentistry and Early Head Start to improve dental care experiences.",,,1,,,
1944,"Development of a silver diamine fluoride protocol in safety net dental settings Purpose: In the United States, silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a new method to arrest dental caries. Protocols for using SDF are under development as the research evolves and experience is gained with different populations and settings. The purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive SDF protocol for young children tailored to safety net dental clinics (SNDCs).< br/> Methods: We developed the SDF protocol for SNDCs through a two-step process: (1) an expert panel of pediatric dentists reviewed, modified, and expanded existing SDF protocols including clinical, pre- and post-clinical components; and (2) the new SDF protocol was implemented in three SNDCs in North Carolina with on-site didactic training, clinical observations and discussion. We obtained feedback from SNDC dentists, staff, and administrators to further refine the SDF protocol.< br/> Results: The SDF protocol was tailored to SNDCs based on recommendations from SNDCs themselves. Suggested improvements were primarily non-clinical in nature, such as the provision of laminated SDF information with color pictures of staining in each operatory, a timer for SDF procedure, and templates for documentation, coding, and billing.< br/> Conclusion: To facilitate SDF use in SNDCs, we developed an expert-consensus protocol that incorporated the clinical experience of SNDCs that implemented the protocol.

1945,"Association of IL4R single-nucleotide polymorphisms with rheumatoid nodules in African Americans with rheumatoid arthritis INTRODUCTION: To determine whether IL4R single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1805010 (I50V) and rs1801275 (Q551R), which have been associated with disease severity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients of European ancestry, relate to the presence of rheumatoid nodules and radiographic erosions in African Americans. METHODS: Two IL4R SNPs, rs1805010 and rs1801275, were genotyped in 749 patients from the Consortium for Longitudinal Evaluation of African-Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) registries. End points were rheumatoid nodules defined as present either by physical examination or by chest radiography and radiographic erosions (radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were scored using the modified Sharp/van der Heijde system). Statistical analyses were performed by using logistic regression modeling adjusted for confounding factors. RESULTS: Of the 749 patients with RA, 156 (20.8%) had rheumatoid nodules, with a mean age of 47.0 years, 84.6% female gender, and median disease duration of 1.9 years. Of the 461 patients with available radiographic data, 185 (40.1%) had erosions (score>0); their mean age was 46.7 years; 83.3% were women; and median disease duration was 1.5 years. Patients positive for HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) and autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP)) had a higher risk of developing rheumatoid nodules in the presence of the AA and AG alleles of rs1801275 (odds ratio (OR)adj=8.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-40.89), P=0.01 and ORadj=2.97 (95% CI, 1.08 to 8.17), P=0.04, respectively). Likewise, patients positive for the HLA-DRB1 SE and RF alone had a higher risk of developing rheumatoid nodules in presence of the AA and AG alleles of rs1801275 (ORadj=8.45 (95% CI, 1.57 to 45.44), P=0.01, and ORadj=3.57 (95% CI, 1.18 to 10.76), P=0.02, respectively) and in the presence of AA allele of rs1805010 (ORadj=4.52 (95% CI, 1.20 to 17.03), P=0.03). No significant association was found between IL4R and radiographic erosions or disease susceptibility, although our statistical power was limited by relatively small numbers of cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: We found that IL4R SNPs, rs1801275 and rs1805010, are associated with rheumatoid nodules in autoantibody-positive African-American RA patients with at least one HLA-DRB1 allele encoding the SE. These findings highlight the need for analysis of genetic factors associated with clinical RA phenotypes in different racial/ethnic populations.",,,3,,,
1946,"APOM and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with lung function and per cent emphysema Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to cardiovascular disease; however, there are few studies on the associations of cardiovascular genes with COPD. We assessed the association of lung function with 2100 genes selected for cardiovascular diseases among 20 077 European-Americans and 6900 African-Americans. We performed replication of significant loci in the other racial group and an independent consortium of Europeans, tested the associations of significant loci with per cent emphysema and examined gene expression in an independent sample. We then tested the association of a related lipid biomarker with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and per cent emphysema. We identified one new polymorphism for FEV1/FVC (rs805301) in European-Americans (p=1.3_10(-6)) and a second (rs707974) in the combined European-American and African-American analysis (p=1.38_10(-7)). Both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flank the gene for apolipoprotein M (APOM), a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Both were replicated in an independent cohort. SNPs in a second gene related to apolipoprotein M and HDL, PCSK9, were associated with FEV1/FVC ratio among African-Americans. rs707974 was associated with per cent emphysema among European-Americans and African-Americans and APOM expression was related to FEV1/FVC ratio and per cent emphysema. Higher HDL levels were associated with lower FEV1/FVC ratio and greater per cent emphysema. These findings suggest a novel role for the apolipoprotein M/HDL pathway in the pathogenesis of COPD and emphysema.",,,8,,,
1947,"Rural residence and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. analysis of the SPIROMICS cohort Rationale: Rural residence is associated with poor outcomes in several chronic diseases. The association between rural residence and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations remains unclear.Objectives: In this work, we sought to determine the independent association between rural residence and COPD-related outcomes, including COPD exacerbations, airflow obstruction, and symptom burden.Methods: A total of 1,684 SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study) participants with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity < 0.70 had geocoding-defined rural-urban residence status determined (N = 204 rural and N = 1,480 urban). Univariate and multivariate logistic and negative binomial regressions were performed to assess the independent association between rurality and COPD outcomes, including exacerbations, lung function, and symptom burden. The primary exposure of interest was rural residence, determined by geocoding of the home address to the block level at the time of study enrollment. Additional covariates of interest included demographic and clinical characteristics, occupation, and occupational exposures. The primary outcome measures were exacerbations determined over a 1-year course after enrollment by quarterly telephone calls and at an annual research clinic visit. The odds ratio (OR) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) of exacerbations that required treatment with medications, including steroids or antibiotics (total exacerbations), and exacerbations leading to hospitalization (severe exacerbations) were determined after adjusting for relevant covariates.Results: Rural residence was independently associated with a 70% increase in the odds of total exacerbations (OR, 1.70 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.56]; P = 0.012) and a 46% higher incidence rate of total exacerbations (IRR 1.46 [95% CI, 1.02-2.10]; P = 0.039). There was no association between rural residence and severe exacerbations. Agricultural occupation was independently associated with increased odds and incidence of total and severe exacerbations. Inclusion of agricultural occupation in the analysis attenuated the association between rural residence and the odds and incidence rate of total exacerbations (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.00-2.32]; P = 0.05 and IRR 1.39 [95% CI, 0.97-1.99]; P = 0.07). There was no difference in symptoms or airflow obstruction between rural and urban participants.Conclusions: Rural residence is independently associated with increased odds and incidence of total, but not severe, COPD exacerbations. These associations are not fully explained by agriculture-related exposures, highlighting the need for future research into potential mechanisms of the increased risk of COPD exacerbations in the rural population.",,,3,,,

1949,"Cardiac structure and function with and without metabolic syndrome: the Echocardiographic Study of Latinos (Echo-SOL) Objective: We assessed the hypothesis that metabolic syndrome is associated with adverse changes in cardiac structure and function in participants of the Echocardiographic Study of Latinos (Echo-SOL). Methods: Non-diabetic Echo-SOL participants were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2009 Joint Scientific Statement. Survey multivariable linear regression analyses using sampling weights were used adjusting for multiple potential confounding variables. Additional analysis was stratified according to the presence/absence of obesity (body mass index (BMI) _25__g/m2) and the presence/absence of metabolic syndrome. Results: Within Echo-SOL, 1260 individuals met inclusion criteria (59% female; mean age 55.2 years). Compared with individuals without metabolic syndrome, those with metabolic syndrome had lower medial and lateral E' velocities (-0.4 cm/s, (SE 0.1), p=0.0002; -0.5 cm/s (0.2), p=0.02, respectively), greater E/E' (0.5(0.2), p=0.01) and worse two-chamber left ventricular longitudinal strain (0.9%(0.3), p=0.009), after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Increased left ventricular mass index (9.8__/m2 (1.9), p< 0.0001__nd 7.5__/m2 (1.7), p< 0.0001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (11.1__L (3.0), p=0.0003__nd 13.3__L (2.7), p< 0.0001), left ventricular end-systolic volume (5.0__L (1.4), p=0.0004__nd 5.7__L (1.3) p< 0.0001) and left ventricular stroke volume (10.2__L (1.8), p< 0.0001__nd 13.0__L (2.0), p< 0.0001) were observed in obese individuals with and without metabolic syndrome compared with individuals with normal weight without metabolic syndrome. In sensitivity analyses, individuals with normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2) and metabolic syndrome had worse left ventricular global longitudinal strain (2.1%(0.7), p=0.002) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (-3.5%(1.4), p=0.007) compared with normal-weight individuals without metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: In a sample of US Hispanics/Latinos metabolic syndrome was associated with worse left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Adverse changes in left ventricular size and function were observed in obese individuals with and without metabolic syndrome but decreased left ventricular function was also present in normal-weight individuals with metabolic syndrome.",,,3,,,
1950,"Childhood and adult exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke and cardiac structure and function: results from Echo-SOL Objective: To describe the relationship of household secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and cardiac structure and function. Methods: Participants (n=1069; 68 % female; age 45-74 years) without history of tobacco use, coronary artery disease or severe valvular disease were included. Past childhood (starting at age < 13 years), adolescent/adult and current exposure to household SHS was assessed. Survey linear regression analyses were used to model the relationship of SHS exposure and echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, adjusting for covariates (age, sex, study site, alcohol use, physical activity and education). Results: SHS exposure in childhood only was associated with reduced E/A velocity ratio (_=-0.06 (SE 0.02), p=0.008). SHS exposure in adolescence/adult only was associated with increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (1.2 (0.6), p=0.04), left atrial volume index (1.7 (0.8), p=0.04) and decreased isovolumic relaxation time (-0.003 (0.002), p=0.03). SHS exposure in childhood and adolescence/adult was associated with worse left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) (two-chamber) (0.8 (0.4), p= 0.049). Compared with individuals who do not live with a tobacco smoker, individuals who currently live with at least one tobacco smoker had reduced LVEF (-1.4 (0.6), p=0.02), LVGLS (average) (0.9 (0.40), p=0.03), medial E' velocity (-0.5 (0.2), p=0.01), E/A ratio (-0.09 (0.03), p=0.003) and right ventricular fractional area change (-0.02 (0.01), p=0.01) with increased isovolumic relaxation time (0.006 (0.003), p=0.04). Conclusions: Past and current household exposure to SHS was associated with abnormalities in cardiac systolic and diastolic function. Reducing household SHS exposure may be an opportunity for cardiac dysfunction prevention to reduce the risk of future clinical heart failure.",,,3,,,
1951,"The evolution of healthcare quality measurement in the United States Quality measurement is fundamental to systematic improvement of the healthcare system. Whilst the United States has made significant investments in healthcare quality measurement and improvement, progress has been somewhat limited. Public and private payers in the United States increasingly mandate measurement and reporting as part of pay-for-performance programmes. Numerous issues have limited improvement, including lack of alignment in the use of measures and improvement strategies, the fragmentation of the U.S. healthcare system, and the lack of national electronic systems for measurement, reporting, benchmarking and improvement. Here, we provide an overview of the evolution of U.S. quality measurement efforts, including the role of the National Quality Forum. Important contextual changes such as the growing shift towards electronic data sources and clinical registries are discussed together with international comparisons. In future, the U.S. healthcare system needs to focus greater attention on the development and use of measures that matter. The three-part aim of effective care, affordable care and healthy communities in the U.S. National Quality Strategy focuses attention on population health and reduction in healthcare disparities. To make significant improvements in U.S. health care, a closer connection between measurement and both evolving national data systems and evidence-based improvement strategies is needed. _ 2016 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.",,,7,,,

1953,"Interventions for trachoma trichiasis BACKGROUND: Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends eliminating trachomatous blindness through the SAFE strategy: Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotic treatment, Facial cleanliness and Environmental hygiene. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for trachomatous trichiasis for people living in endemic settings. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 7 May 2015. We searched the reference lists of included studies to identify further potentially relevant studies. We also contacted authors for details of other relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials of any intervention intended to treat trachomatous trichiasis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently selected and assessed the trials, including the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for missing data when necessary. Our primary outcome was post-operative trichiasis which was defined as any lash touching the globe at three months, one year or two years after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria with 8586 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of the studies were of a low or unclear risk of bias.Five studies compared different surgical interventions. Most surgical interventions were performed by non-physician technicians. These trials suggest the most effective surgery is full-thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the terminal tarsal strip. Pooled data from two studies suggested that the bilamellar rotation was more effective than unilamellar rotation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.50). Use of a lid clamp reduced lid contour abnormalities (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98) and granuloma formation (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.97). Absorbable sutures gave comparable outcomes to silk sutures (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20) and were associated with less frequent granuloma formation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.99). Epilation was less effective at preventing eyelashes from touching the globe than surgery for mild trichiasis, but had comparable results for vision and corneal change. Peri-operative azithromycin reduced post-operative trichiasis; however, the estimate of effect was imprecise and compatible with no effect or increased trichiasis (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 1954 eyes; 3 studies). Community-based surgery when compared to health centres increased uptake with comparable outcomes. Surgery performed by ophthalmologists and integrated eye care workers was comparable. Adverse events were typically infrequent or mild and included rare postoperative infections, eyelid contour abnormalities and conjunctival granulomas. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No trials were designed to evaluate whether the interventions for trichiasis prevent blindness as an outcome; however, several found modest improvement in vision following intervention. Certain interventions have been shown to be more effective at eliminating trichiasis. Full-thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the lash-bearing lid margin was found to be the best technique and is preferably delivered in the community. Surgery may be carried out by an ophthalmologist or a trained ophthalmic assistant. Surgery performed with silk or absorbable sutures gave comparable results. Post-operative azithromycin was found to improve outcomes where over ll recurrence was low.",,,5,,,
1954,"The sodium-dependent ascorbic acid transporter family SLC23 Transporters for vitamin C and its oxidized form dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) are crucial to maintain physiological concentrations of this important vitamin that is used in a variety of biochemical processes. The human SLC23 family consists of the Na(+)-dependent vitamin C transporters SVCT1 (encoded by the SLC23A1 gene) and SVCT2 (SLC23A2) as well as an orphan transporter SVCT3 (SLC23A3). Phylogenetically, the SLC23 family belongs to the nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) family, although no nucleobase transport has yet been demonstrated for the human members of this family. The SVCT1 and SVCT2 transporters are rather specific for ascorbic acid, which is an important antioxidant and plays a crucial role in a many metal-containing enzymes. SVCT1 is expressed predominantly in epithelial tissues such as intestine where it contributes to the supply and maintenance of whole-body ascorbic acid levels. In contrast to various other mammals, humans are not capable of synthesizing ascorbic acid from glucose and therefore the uptake of ascorbic acid from the diet via SVCT1 is essential for maintaining appropriate concentrations of vitamin C in the human body. The expression of SVCT2 is relatively widespread, where it serves to either deliver ascorbic acid to tissues with high demand of the vitamin for enzymatic reactions or to protect metabolically highly active cells or specialized tissues from oxidative stress. The murine Slc23a3 gene encoding the orphan transporter SVCT3 was originally cloned from mouse yolk sac, and subsequent studies showed that it is expressed in the kidney. However, the function of SVCT3 has not been reported and it remains speculative as to whether SVCT3 is a nucleobase transporter. Copyright _ 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
1955,"Society of Behavioral Medicine position statement: early care and education (ECE) policies can impact obesity prevention among preschool-aged children The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) urges policymakers to help prevent childhood obesity by improving state regulations for early care and education (ECE) settings related to child nutrition, physical activity, and screen time. More than three quarters of preschool-aged children in the USA attend ECE settings, and many spend up to 40 h per week under ECE care. ECE settings provide meals and snacks, as well as opportunities for increasing daily physical activity and reducing sedentary screen time. However, many states' current policies do not adequately address these important elements of obesity prevention. A growing number of cities and states, child health organizations, medical and early childhood associations, and academic researchers are beginning to identify specific elements of policy and regulations that could transform ECE settings into environments that contribute to obesity prevention. Let's Move! Child Care recommends a set of straightforward regulations addressing nutrition, physical activity, and screen time in ECE settings. These emerging models provide local and state leaders with concrete steps to implement obesity prevention initiatives. We provide a set of recommendations based upon these models that will help state and local policymakers to improve current policies in ECE settings.",,,9,,,
1956,"Diagnostic accuracy and prediction increment of markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition to assess cancer cell detachment from primary tumors BACKGROUND: Metastases play a role in about 90% of cancer deaths. Markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) measured in primary tumor cancer cells might provide diagnostic information about the likelihood that cancer cells have detached from the primary tumor. Used together with established diagnostic tests of detachment-lymph node evaluation and radiologic imaging-EMT marker measurements might improve the ability of clinicians to assess the patient's risk of metastatic disease. Translation of EMT markers to clinical use has been hampered by a lack of valid analyses of clinically-informative parameters. Here, we demonstrate a rigorous approach to estimating the sensitivity, specificity, and prediction increment of an EMT marker to assess cancer cell detachment from primary tumors. METHODS: We illustrate the approach using immunohistochemical measurements of the EMT marker E-cadherin in a set of colorectal primary tumors from a population-based prospective cohort in North Carolina. Bayesian latent class analysis was used to estimate sensitivity and specificity in a setting of multiple imperfect diagnostic tests and no gold standard. Risk reclassification analysis was used to assess the extent to which addition of the marker to the panel of established diagnostic tests would improve mortality prediction. We explored how changing the latent class conditional dependence assumptions and definition of marker positivity would impact the results. RESULTS: All diagnostic accuracy and prediction increment statistics varied with the choice of cut point to define marker positivity. When comparing different definitions of marker positivity to each other, numerous trade-offs were observed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, predictive discrimination, and prediction model calibration. We then discussed several implementation considerations and the plausibility of analytic assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: The approaches presented here can be extended to any EMT marker, to most forms of cancer, and to different kinds of EMT marker measurements, such as RNA or gene methylation data. These methods provide valid, clinically-informative assessment of whether and how to use a given EMT marker to refine tumor staging and consequent treatment decisions.",,,1,,,
1957,"Lifestyle factors, colorectal tumor methylation, and survival among african americans and european americans Differences in tumor characteristics might partially account for mortality disparities between African American (AA) and European American (EA) colorectal cancer patients. We evaluated effect modification by race for exposure and patient-outcomes associations with colorectal tumor methylation among 218 AA and 267 EA colorectal cancer cases from the population-based North Carolina Colon Cancer Study. Tumor methylation was assessed in CACNA1G, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1. We used logistic regression to assess whether associations between several lifestyle factors-intake of fruits, vegetables, folate, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-and tumor methylation were modified by race. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate whether race modified associations between tumor methylation and time to all-cause mortality. Greater fruit consumption was associated with greater odds of high NEUROG1 methylation among EA at methylation cut points of 15-35% (maximum OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.66, 7.13) but not among AA. Higher folate intake was associated with lower odds of high CACNA1G methylation among EAs but not AAs. Tumor methylation was not associated with all-cause mortality for either group. Race might modify associations between lifestyle factors and colorectal tumor methylation, but in this sample did not appear to modify associations between tumor methylation and all-cause mortality.",,,3,,,
1958,"Functional health literacy, chemotherapy decisions, and outcomes among a colorectal cancer cohort BACKGROUND: Functional health literacy is essential for the self-management of chronic diseases and preventive health behaviors. Patients with cancer who have a low level of health literacy may be at greater risk for poor care and poor outcomes. METHODS: We assessed health literacy using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults in 347 participants with colorectal cancer who were nested within a prospective observational study of system, health care provider, and participant characteristics influencing cancer outcomes. RESULTS: Having adequate health literacy increased the likelihood that participants with stage 3/4 disease received chemotherapy (odds ratio, 3.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-8.80) but had no effect on cancer stage at diagnosis or vital status at last observation during postenrollment follow-up. No difference was seen in health literacy status regarding participant beliefs and preferences about chemotherapy among those with stage 3/4 disease, nor in participant roles in deciding whether to receive chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower levels of health literacy were less likely to receive chemotherapy compared with participants with higher levels of health literacy. Therefore, clear communication related to key health care decisions may lead to fewer disparities due to a patient's level of health literacy.",,,3,,,
1959,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease and odds of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in North Carolina OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Exposure to excess gastric acid resulting from gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as acid reflux or heartburn, might contribute to initiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, particularly laryngeal cancer. Prior epidemiologic studies have reported inconsistent results. We sought to clarify this relationship using an observational study with a larger available sample size and better-characterized exposure information than most prior studies. STUDY DESIGN: A population-based case-control study of head and neck cancer in North Carolina with 1,340 newly diagnosed cases and 1,378 controls matched on age, race, and sex. METHODS: We used unconditional logistic regression to examine associations between self-reported heartburn and development of overall head and neck cancer as well as development of cancer at specific tumor sites. Subgroup analysis by smoking and alcoholic drinking status was used to make comparisons with a previous study that used a similar study design. RESULTS: Overall, an increased odds of head and neck cancer was not associated with either self-reported history of heartburn symptoms (odds ratio = 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.68, 1.06) or self-reported medical diagnosis of GERD (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.71, 1.11). These patterns held for specific tumor sites. For laryngopharyngeal cancer, we did not detect any associations regardless of joint smoking and alcoholic drinking status.

1960,"Approaches to address premature death of patients when assessing patterns of use of health care services after an index event BACKGROUND: Studies of the use of health care after the onset of disease are important for assessing quality of care, treatment disparities, and guideline compliance. Cohort definition and analysis method are important considerations for the generalizability and validity of study results. We compared different approaches for cohort definition (restriction by survival time vs. comorbidity score) and analysis method [Kaplan-Meier (KM) vs. competing risk] when assessing patterns of guideline adoption in elderly patients. METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries aged 65-95 years old who had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 2008 were eligible for this study. Beneficiaries with substantial frailty or an AMI in the prior year were excluded. We compared KM with competing risk estimates of guideline adoption during the first year post-AMI. RESULTS: At 1-year post-AMI, 14.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.0%-14.5%) of beneficiaries overall initiated cardiac rehabilitation when using competing risk analysis and 15.1% (95% CI, 14.8%-15.3%) from the KM analysis. Guideline medication adoption was estimated as 52.3% (95% CI, 52.0%-52.7%) and 53.4% (95% CI, 53.1%-53.8%) for competing risk and KM methods, respectively. Mortality was 17.0% (95%CI, 16.8%-17.3%) at 1 year post-AMI. The difference in cardiac rehabilitation initiation at 1-year post-AMI from the overall population was 0.1%, 1.7%, and 1.9% compared with 30-day survivor, 1-year survivor, and comorbidity-score restricted populations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the KM method consistently overestimated the competing risk method. Competing risk approaches avoid unrealistic mortality assumptions and lead to interpretations of estimates that are more meaningful.",,,5,,,
1961,"Position matters: Validation of medicare hospital claims for myocardial infarction against medical record review in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to investigate sensitivity and specificity of myocardial infarction (MI) case definitions using multiple discharge code positions and multiple diagnosis codes when comparing administrative data to hospital surveillance data. METHODS: Hospital surveillance data for ARIC Study cohort participants with matching participant ID and service dates to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) hospitalization records for hospitalizations occurring between 2001 and 2013 were included in this study. Classification of Definite or Probable MI from ARIC medical record review defined ""gold standard"" comparison for validation measures. In primary analyses, an MI was defined with ICD9 code 410 from CMS records. Secondary analyses defined MI using code 410 in combination with additional codes. RESULTS: A total of 25_549 hospitalization records met study criteria. In primary analysis, specificity was at least 0.98 for all CMS definitions by discharge code position. Sensitivity ranged from 0.48 for primary position only to 0.63 when definition included any discharge code position. The sensitivity of definitions including codes 410 and 411.1 were higher than sensitivity observed when using code 410 alone. Specificity of these alternate definitions was higher for women (0.98) than for men (0.96). CONCLUSION: Algorithms that rely exclusively on primary discharge code position will miss approximately 50% of all MI cases due to low sensitivity of this definition. We recommend defining MI by code 410 in any of first 5 discharge code positions overall and by codes 410 and 411.1 in any of first 3 positions for sensitivity analyses of women.

1962,"Blood gene expression profiling of an early acetaminophen response Acetaminophen can adversely affect the liver especially when overdosed. We used whole blood as a surrogate to identify genes as potential early indicators of an acetaminophen-induced response. In a clinical study, healthy human subjects were dosed daily with 4__ of either acetaminophen or placebo pills for 7 days and evaluated over the course of 14 days. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels for responders to acetaminophen increased between days 4 and 9 after dosing, and 12 genes were detected with expression profiles significantly altered within 24__. The early responsive genes separated the subjects by class and dose period. In addition, the genes clustered patients who overdosed on acetaminophen apart from controls and also predicted the exposure classifications with 100% accuracy. The responsive genes serve as early indicators of an acetaminophen exposure, and their gene expression profiles can potentially be evaluated as molecular indicators for further consideration.",,,1,,,
1963,"A Person-Centered Approach to Poststroke Care: The COMprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services Model Many individuals who have had a stroke leave the hospital without postacute care services in place. Despite high risks of complications and readmission, there is no standard in the United States for postacute stroke care after discharge home. We describe the rationale and methods for the development of the COMprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) care model and the structure and quality metrics used for implementation. COMPASS, an innovative, comprehensive extension of the TRAnsition Coaching for Stroke (TRACS) program, is a clinician-led quality improvement model providing early supported discharge and transitional care for individuals who have had a stroke and have been discharged home. The effectiveness of the COMPASS model is being assessed in a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in 41 sites across North Carolina, with a recruitment goal of 6,000 participants. The COMPASS model is evidence based, person centered, and stakeholder driven. It involves identification and education of eligible individuals in the hospital; telephone follow-up 2, 30, and 60 days after discharge; and a clinic visit within 14 days conducted by a nurse and advanced practice provider. Patient and caregiver self-reported assessments of functional and social determinants of health are captured during the clinic visit using a web-based application. Embedded algorithms immediately construct an individualized care plan. The COMPASS model's pragmatic design and quality metrics may support measurable best practices for postacute stroke care. _ 2018, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation _ 2018, The American Geriatrics Society.",,,6,,,
1964,"Examining parental medication adherence as a predictor of child medication adherence in pediatric anxiety disorders BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the recommended first-line pharmacotherapy for pediatric anxiety disorders but adherence remains difficult to predict. OBJECTIVES: To estimate SSRI adherence in children with anxiety disorders and determine if prior parental medication adherence is predictive of child high SSRI adherence. METHODS: We identified children (3-17__) initiating SSRI treatment after an anxiety disorder diagnosis in a commercial claims database (2005-2014). We evaluated parent SSRI, statin, and antihypertensive adherence [6-mo proportion days covered (PDC), high adherence=PDC_0.80] in the year before child SSRI initiation. We estimated risk differences (RD) of child high SSRI adherence (6-mo PDC) stratified by parent adherence and multivariable risk ratios using modified Poisson regression. We estimated change in c-statistic and risk reclassification when adding parent-level covariates with child-level covariates to predict child adherence. RESULTS: In 70,979 children with an anxiety disorder (59%=female, 14=median age), the mean 6-month SSRI PDC was 0.72, with variation by anxiety disorder. Overall 64% of children had high adherence if their parent had high SSRI adherence versus 53% of children with parents with low SSRI adherence (RD, 12%; multivariable risk ratios, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.20). Findings were similar for parent statin (RD=10%) and antihypertensive adherence (RD=8%) and when stratified by child age and parent sex. There was minor improvement in risk reclassification and the c-statistic after adding parent adherence and parent-level covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Parental medication adherence could help providers identify children at risk of nonadherence to inform the treatment decision, reduce unnecessary medication switches, and lead to broader effective interventions.",,,3,,,
1965,"Incidence of mental health hospitalizations, treated self-harm, and emergency room visits following new anxiety disorder diagnoses in privately insured U.S. children BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental illnesses in children and associated with high healthcare utilization. We aimed to estimate 2-year cumulative incidence of mental health-related hospitalizations, treated self-harm, and emergency room (ER) visits in children newly diagnosed with anxiety disorders and, for context, in children without anxiety disorders. METHODS: We identified commercially insured treatment na_ve children (3-17 years) with a new office-based anxiety disorder diagnosis (ICD-9-CM) from 2005-2014 in the MarketScan claims database. We followed children for up to 2 years after diagnosis for the first of each event: mental health-related hospitalization, inpatient, treated self-harm, and ER visits (any, anxiety-related, injury-related). Children without anxiety diagnoses were included as comparators, matched on age, sex, date, and region. We estimated cumulative incidence of each event using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: From 2005-2014, we identified 198,450 children with a new anxiety diagnosis. One-year after anxiety diagnosis, 2.0% of children had a mental health-related hospitalization, 0.08% inpatient, treated self-harm, 1.4% anxiety-related ER visit, and 20% any ER visit; incidence was highest in older children with baseline comorbid depression. One-year cumulative incidence of each event was lower in the comparison cohort without anxiety (e.g., mental health-related hospitalizations_=_0.5%, treated self-harm_=_0.01%, and ER visits_=_13%). CONCLUSIONS: Given the prevalence of anxiety disorders, 2-year incidence estimates translate to a significant number of children experiencing each event. Our findings offer caregivers, providers, and patients information to better understand the burden of anxiety disorders and can help anticipate healthcare utilization and inform efforts to prevent these serious events. _ 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,
1966,"Glucocorticoid receptor DNA methylation, childhood maltreatment and major depression INTRODUCTION: Altered DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes has been associated with exposure to childhood maltreatment (CM) and depression; however, it is unknown whether CM and depression have joint and potentially interacting effects on the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) DNAm. We investigated the impact of CM and lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) on NR3C1 DNAm and gene expression (GE) in 147 adult participants from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study. METHODS: NR3C1 promoter region DNAm was assessed via pyrosequencing using whole blood-derived DNA. Quantitative RT-PCR assays measured GE from leukocyte-derived RNA. Linear regression models were used to examine the relationship among CM, MDD, and DNAm. RESULTS: Both CM and MDD were significant predictors of NR3C1 DNAm: CM was associated with an increase in DNAm in an EGR1 transcription factor binding site (TFBS), whereas MDD was associated with a decrease in DNAm downstream of the TFBS. No significant CM-MDD interactions were observed. CM alone was associated with significantly lower NR3C1 GE. LIMITATIONS: Our report of CM is a retrospective self-report of abuse, which may introduce recall bias. DNAm was measured in whole blood and may not reflect brain-derived DNAm levels. CONCLUSIONS: CM and MDD are both associated with altered DNAm levels in the NR3C1 promoter region, however the location and direction of effects differ between the two exposures, and the functional effects, as measured by GE, appear to be limited to CM exposure alone. CM exposure may be biologically embedded in this key HPA axis gene. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
1967,"FKBP5 DNA methylation does not mediate the association between childhood maltreatment and depression symptom severity in the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study Exposure to childhood maltreatment increases the risk of developing mental illness later in life. Childhood maltreatment and depression have both been associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-a key regulator of the body's stress response. Additionally, HPA axis dysregulation has been implicated in the etiology of a range of mental illnesses. A substantial body of work has shown history of childhood maltreatment alters DNA methylation levels within key HPA axis genes. We therefore investigated whether one of these key genes, FKBP5 mediates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and depression, and assessed FKBP5 DNA methylation and gene expression within 112 adults from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS). DNA methylation was assessed in 4 regions, including the upstream promoter, downstream promoter, and two glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) via pyrosequencing using whole blood derived DNA; Taqman assays measured relative RNA expression from leukocytes. Mediation analyses were conducted using sequential linear regression. Childhood maltreatment was significantly associated with depression symptom severity (FDR_< _0.006), but was not a significant predictor of DNA methylation in any of the four loci examined. FKBP5 showed elevated expression levels in participants with vs. without a history of depression (p_< _0.001); no significant difference in gene expression levels was observed in relation to childhood maltreatment (p_>_0.05). Our results suggest DNA methylation does not mediate the childhood maltreatment-depression association in the DNHS. Copyright _ 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
1968,"Left-Biased Spermatogenic Failure in 129/SvJ Dnd1Ter/+ Mice Correlates with Differences in Vascular Architecture, Oxygen Availability, and Metabolites Homozygosity for the Ter mutation in the RNA-binding protein Dead end 1 (Dnd1(Ter/Ter)) sensitizes germ cells to degeneration in all mouse strains. In 129/SvJ mice, approximately 10% of Dnd1(Ter/+) heterozygotes develop spermatogenic failure, and 95% of unilateral cases occur in the left testis. The first differences between right and left testes were detected at Postnatal Day 15 when many more spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) were undergoing apoptosis in the left testis compared to the right. As we detected no significant left/right differences in the molecular pathway associated with body axis asymmetry or in the expression of signals known to promote proliferation, differentiation, and survival of germ cells, we investigated whether physiological differences might account for asymmetry of the degeneration phenotype. We show that left/right differences in vascular architecture are associated with a decrease in hemoglobin saturation and increased levels of HIF-1alpha in the left testis compared to the right. In Dnd1 heterozygotes, lower oxygen availability was associated with metabolic differences, including lower levels of ATP and NADH in the left testis. These experiments suggest a dependence on oxygen availability and metabolic substrates for SSC survival and suggest that Dnd1(Ter/+) SSCs may act as efficient sensors to detect subtle environmental changes that alter SSC fate. _ 2015 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.",,,1,,,
1969,"Identification of genetic variants in CFAP221 as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disorder that affects the biogenesis or function of motile cilia resulting in chronic airway disease. PCD is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, with causative mutations identified in over 40 genes; however, the genetic basis of many cases is unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified three affected siblings with clinical symptoms of PCD but normal ciliary structure, carrying compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants in CFAP221. Computational analysis suggests that these variants are the most damaging alleles shared by all three siblings. Nasal epithelial cells from one of the subjects demonstrated slightly reduced beat frequency (16.5__z vs 17.7__z, p_=_0.16); however, waveform analysis revealed that the CFAP221 defective cilia beat in an aberrant circular pattern. These results show that genetic variants in CFAP221 cause PCD and that CFAP221 should be considered a candidate gene in cases where PCD is suspected but cilia structure and beat frequency appear normal.",,,1,,,
1970,"Lack of GAS2L2 causes PCD by impairing cilia orientation and mucociliary clearance Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder in which impaired ciliary function leads to chronic airway disease. Exome sequencing of a PCD subject identified an apparent homozygous frameshift variant, c.887_890delTAAG (p.Val296Glyfs_13), in exon 5; this frameshift introduces a stop codon in amino acid 308 of the growth arrest-specific protein 2-like 2 (GAS2L2). Further genetic screening of unrelated PCD subjects identified a second proband with a compound heterozygous variant carrying the identical frameshift variant and a large deletion (c.867__343+1207del; p.?) starting in exon 5. Both individuals had clinical features of PCD but normal ciliary axoneme structure. In this research, using human nasal cells, mouse models, and X.laevis embryos, we show that GAS2L2 is abundant at the apical surface of ciliated cells, where it localizes with basal bodies, basal feet, rootlets, and actin filaments. Cultured GAS2L2-deficient nasal epithelial cells from one of the affected individuals showed defects in ciliary orientation and had an asynchronous and hyperkinetic (GAS2L2-deficient = 19.8_Hz versus control = 15.8_Hz) ciliary-beat pattern. These results were recapitulated in Gas2l2-/- mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures and in X._laevis embryos treated with Gas2l2 morpholinos. In mice, the absence of Gas2l2 caused neonatal death, and the conditional deletion of Gas2l2 impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and led to mucus accumulation. These results show that a pathogenic variant in GAS2L2 causes a genetic defect in ciliary orientation and impairs MCC and results in_PCD. Copyright _ 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.

1971,"Predictors of low uptake of prenatal tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis immunization in privately insured women in the united states OBJECTIVE: To examine the uptake of prenatal tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) immunization among pregnant women in the United States. METHODS: Using MarketScan data, we conducted a historical cohort study among pregnant women with employer-based commercial insurance in the United States who delivered between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. We examined temporal trends of uptake, predictors of uptake, and timing of Tdap immunization. RESULTS: Among 1,222,384 eligible pregnancies in 1,147,711 women, receipt of prenatal Tdap immunization increased from 0.0% of women who delivered in January 2010 to 9.8% who delivered in October 2012 (the date of the recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for Tdap during every pregnancy) to 44.4% who delivered in December 2014. Among women who received Tdap during pregnancy, the majority were immunized between 27 weeks and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation. In multivariable analyses among women who delivered between November 2012 and December 2014, rates of prenatal Tdap immunization were lower for women younger than 25 years of age (eg, 20-24 compared with 30-34 years rate ratio [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.88), with other children (eg, three compared with zero children: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84-0.88), residing in the South compared with the Midwest (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.80-0.82), or with emergency department visits in early pregnancy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.95). The proportion of pregnant women who received prenatal Tdap increased with increasing gestational age at birth. CONCLUSION: By the end of 2014, fewer than half of pregnant women in the United States were receiving prenatal Tdap immunization. Implementation and dissemination strategies are needed to increase Tdap coverage among pregnant women, especially those who are young, have other children, or reside in the South.",,,6,,,
1972,"Cancer incidence among US Medicare ESRD patients receiving hemodialysis, 1996-2009 BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving dialysis have been reported to have increased risk of cancer. However, contemporary cancer burden estimates in this population are sparse and do not account for the high competing risk of death characteristic of dialysis patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: US adult patients enrolled in Medicare's ESRD program who received in-center hemodialysis. FACTORS: Demographic/clinical characteristics. OUTCOMES: For overall and site-specific cancers identified using claims-based definitions, we calculated annual incidence rates (1996-2009). We estimated 5-year cumulative incidence since dialysis therapy initiation using competing-risk methods. RESULTS: We observed a constant rate of incident cancers for all sites combined, from 3,923 to 3,860 cases per 100,000 person-years (annual percentage change, 0.1; 95% CI,_-0.4 to 0.6). Rates for some common site-specific cancers increased (ie, kidney/renal pelvis) and decreased (ie, colon/rectum, lung/bronchus, pancreas, and other sites). Of 482,510 incident hemodialysis patients, cancer was diagnosed in 37,128 within 5 years after dialysis therapy initiation. The 5-year cumulative incidence of any cancer was 9.48% (95% CI, 9.39%-9.57%) and was higher for certain subgroups: older age, males, nonwhites, non-Hispanics, nondiabetes primary ESRD cause, recent dialysis therapy initiation, and history of transplantation evaluation. Among blacks and whites, we observed 35,767 cases compared with 25,194 expected cases if the study population had experienced rates observed in the US general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.41-1.43). Risk was most elevated for cancers of the kidney/renal pelvis (SIR, 4.03; 95% CI, 3.88-4.19) and bladder (SIR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.51-1.64). LIMITATIONS: Claims-based cancer definitions have not been validated in the ESRD population. Information for cancer risk factors was not available in our data source. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a high burden of cancer in the dialysis population compared to the US general population, with varying patterns of cancer incidence in subgroups.

1973,"Novel loci associated with PR interval in a genome-wide association study of 10 African American cohorts BACKGROUND: The PR interval, as measured by the resting, standard 12-lead ECG, reflects the duration of atrial/atrioventricular nodal depolarization. Substantial evidence exists for a genetic contribution to PR, including genome-wide association studies that have identified common genetic variants at 9 loci influencing PR in populations of European and Asian descent. However, few studies have examined loci associated with PR in African Americans. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present results from the largest genome-wide association study to date of PR in 13 415 adults of African descent from 10 cohorts. We tested for association between PR (ms) and _2.8 million genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Imputation was performed using HapMap 2 YRI and CEU panels. Study-specific results, adjusted for global ancestry and clinical correlates of PR, were meta-analyzed using the inverse variance method. Variation in genome-wide test statistic distributions was noted within studies (_ range: 0.9-1.1), although not after genomic control correction was applied to the overall meta-analysis (_: 1.008). In addition to generalizing previously reported associations with MEIS1, SCN5A, ARHGAP24, CAV1, and TBX5 to African American populations at the genome-wide significance level (P< 5.0 _ 10(-8)), we also identified a novel locus: ITGA9, located in a region previously implicated in SCN5A expression. The 3p21 region harboring SCN5A also contained 2 additional independent secondary signals influencing PR (P< 5.0 _ 10(-8)). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability to map novel loci in African Americans as well as the generalizability of loci associated with PR across populations of African, European, and Asian descent.",,,8,,,
1974,"Incorporating Patient Preferences into Estimation of Optimal Individualized Treatment Rules Precision medicine seeks to provide treatment only if, when, to whom, and at the dose it is needed. Thus, precision medicine is a vehicle by which healthcare can be made both more effective and efficient. Individualized treatment rules operationalize precision medicine as a map from current patient information to a recommended treatment. An optimal individualized treatment rule is defined as maximizing the mean of a pre-specified scalar outcome. However, in settings with multiple outcomes, choosing a scalar composite outcome by which to define optimality is difficult. Furthermore, when there is heterogeneity across patient preferences for these outcomes, it may not be possible to construct a single composite outcome that leads to high-quality treatment recommendations for all patients. We simultaneously estimate the optimal individualized treatment rule for all composite outcomes representable as a convex combination of the (suitably transformed) outcomes. For each patient, we use a preference elicitation questionnaire and item response theory to derive the posterior distribution over preferences for these composite outcomes and subsequently derive an estimator of an optimal individualized treatment rule tailored to patient preferences. We prove that as the number of subjects and items on the questionnaire diverge, our estimator is consistent for an oracle optimal individualized treatment rule wherein each patient's preference is known a priori. We illustrate the proposed method using data from a clinical trial on antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia. _ 2017, The International Biometric Society.",,,1,,,
1975,"Prediagnostic Smoking Is Associated with Binary and Quantitative Measures of ER Protein and ESR1 mRNA Expression in Breast Tumors Background: Smoking is a possible risk factor for breast cancer and has been linked to increased risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) disease in some epidemiologic studies. It is unknown whether smoking has quantitative effects on ER expression.Methods: We examined relationships between smoking and ER expression from tumors of 1,888 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from a population-based study in North Carolina. ER expression was characterized using binary (_) and continuous measures for ER protein, ESR1 mRNA, and a multigene luminal score (LS) that serves as a measure of estrogen signaling in breast tumors. We used logistic and linear regression models to estimate temporal and dose-dependent associations between smoking and ER measures.Results: The odds of ER+, ESR1+, and LS+ tumors among current smokers (at the time of diagnosis), those who smoked 20 or more years, and those who smoked within 5 years of diagnosis were nearly double those of nonsmokers. Quantitative levels of ESR1 were highest among current smokers compared with never smokers overall [mean (log2) = 9.2 vs. 8.7, P < 0.05] and among ER+ cases; however, we did not observe associations between smoking measures and continuous ER protein expression.Conclusions: In relationship to breast cancer diagnosis, recent smoking was associated with higher odds of the ER+, ESR1+, and LS+ subtype. Current smoking was associated with elevated ESR1 mRNA levels and an elevated LS, but not with altered ER protein.Impact: A multigene LS and single-gene ESR1 mRNA may capture tumor changes associated with smoking.

1976,"Patterns of colorectal cancer care in the United States and Canada: a systematic review Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States and Canada. Given the high incidence and increased survival of colorectal cancer patients, prevalence is increasing over time in both countries. Using MEDLINE, we conducted a systematic review of the literature published between 2000 and 2010 to describe patterns of colorectal cancer care. Specifically we examined data sources used to obtain treatment information and compared patterns of cancer-directed initial care, post-diagnostic surveillance care, and end-of-life care among colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in the United States and Canada. Receipt of initial treatment for colorectal cancer was associated with the anatomical position of the tumor and extent of disease at diagnosis, in accordance with consensus-based guidelines. Overall, care trends were similar between the United States and Canada; however, we observed differences with respect to data sources used to measure treatment receipt. Differences were also present between study populations within country, further limiting direct comparisons. Findings from this review will allow researchers, clinicians, and policy makers to evaluate treatment receipt by patient, clinical, or system characteristics and identify emerging trends over time. Furthermore, comparisons between health-care systems in the United States and Canada can identify disparities in care, allow the evaluation of different models of care, and highlight issues regarding the utility of existing data sources to estimate national patterns of care.",,,5,,,
1977,"Active smoking and risk of Luminal and Basal-like breast cancer subtypes in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study PURPOSE: Growing evidence suggests an association between active cigarette smoking and increased breast cancer risk. However, the weak magnitude of association and conflicting results have yielded uncertainty and it is unknown whether associations differ by breast cancer subtype. METHODS: Using population-based case-control data from phases I and II of the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, we examined associations between self-reported measures of smoking and risk of Luminal and Basal-like breast cancers. We used logistic regression models to estimate case-control odds ratios (OR) and 95_% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Ever smoking (current and former) was associated with a weakly increased risk of Luminal breast cancer (OR 1.12, 95_% CI 0.92-1.36) and was not associated with risk of Basal-like breast cancer (OR 0.96, 95_% CI 0.69-1.32). Similarly, smoking duration of more than 20_years was associated with increased risk of Luminal (OR 1.51, 95_% CI 1.19-1.93), but not Basal-like breast cancer (OR 0.90, 95_% CI 0.57-1.43). When stratified by race, elevated odds ratios between smoking and Luminal breast cancer risk were found among black women across multiple exposure measures (ever smoking, duration, and dose); conversely, among white women odds ratios were attenuated or null. CONCLUSIONS: Results from our study demonstrate a positive association between smoking and Luminal breast cancer risk, particularly among black women and women with long smoking histories. Addressing breast cancer heterogeneity in studies of smoking and breast cancer risk may elucidate associations masked in prior studies.",,,3,,,
1978,"Trends in Energy Intake from Alcoholic Beverages among US Adults by Sociodemographic Characteristics, 1989-2012 BACKGROUND: Long-term US trends in alcoholic beverage calorie intakes remain unexamined, particularly with respect to changes in population subgroup-specific patterns over time. OBJECTIVE: This study examined shifts in the consumption of alcoholic beverages, in total and by beverage type, on any given day among US adults in relation to sociodemographic characteristics. DESIGN: This study was a repeated cross-sectional analysis of data from the 1989-1991 and 1994-1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and the 2003-2006 and 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Adults aged _19 years (N=39,298) were targeted. A subset of alcoholic beverage consumers (n=7,081) were studied. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Survey weighted mean per capita per day intakes (among all participants, both consumers of alcoholic beverages and nonconsumers) and contributions of beer, wine, and liquor/mixed drinks to total alcoholic beverage energy were determined. Multivariable regression models were used to examine trends in the proportion of alcoholic beverage consumers and the per consumer intakes (among consumers of alcoholic beverages only). RESULTS: Per capita intakes from alcoholic beverages increased from 49 kcal/capita/day in 1989-1991 to 109 kcal/capita/day in 2003-2006 (P< 0.001). The proportion consuming alcoholic beverages on any given day increased significantly from 1989-1991 to 2009-2012 (P for overall increasing trend < 0.0001) for most sociodemographic subgroups. Per consumer, alcoholic beverage calories increased between 1989-1991 and 1994-1996 (P< 0.05) for many subpopulations. Adults with less than high school education were less likely to consume alcohol, yet had higher per consumer calorie intakes compared with adults with a college degree. Women and adults aged _60 years experienced a shift away from liquor/mixed drinks toward wine between 2003-2006 and 2009-2012. Beer contributed roughly 70% to total alcoholic beverage intake for less educated consumers across time. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate there has been an increase in the proportion of US adults who drink on any given day and an increase in calories consumed from alcoholic beverages when drinking occurs.

1979,"Global metabolomic profiling targeting childhood obesity in the Hispanic population BACKGROUND: Metabolomics may unravel important biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of childhood obesity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to 1) identify metabolites that differ significantly between nonobese and obese Hispanic children; 2) collapse metabolites into principal components (PCs) associated with obesity and metabolic risk, specifically hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperuricemia; and 3) identify metabolites associated with energy expenditure and fat oxidation. DESIGN: This trial was a cross-sectional observational study of metabolomics by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses performed on fasting plasma samples from 353 nonobese and 450 obese Hispanic children. RESULTS: Branched-chained amino acids (BCAAs) (Leu, Ile, and Val) and their catabolites, propionylcarnitine and butyrylcarnitine, were significantly elevated in obese children. Strikingly lower lysolipids and dicarboxylated fatty acids were seen in obese children. Steroid derivatives were markedly higher in obese children as were markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. PC6 (BCAAs and aromatic AAs) and PC10 (asparagine, glycine, and serine) made the largest contributions to body mass index, and PC10 and PC12 (acylcarnitines) made the largest contributions to adiposity. Metabolic risk factors and total energy expenditure were associated with PC6, PC9 (AA and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites), and PC10. Fat oxidation was inversely related to PC8 (lysolipids) and positively related to PC16 (acylcarnitines). CONCLUSIONS: Global metabolomic profiling in nonobese and obese children replicates the increased BCAA and acylcarnitine catabolism and changes in nucleotides, lysolipids, and inflammation markers seen in obese adults; however, a strong signature of reduced fatty acid catabolism and increased steroid derivatives may be unique to obese children. Metabolic flexibility in fuel use observed in obese children may occur through the activation of alternative intermediary pathways. Insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, and oxidative stress and inflammation evident in obese children are associated with distinct metabolomic profiles. _ 2015 American Society for Nutrition.",,,4,,,
1980,"Resequencing of IRS2 reveals rare variants for obesity but not fasting glucose homeostasis in Hispanic children Our objective was to resequence insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) to identify variants associated with obesity- and diabetes-related traits in Hispanic children. Exonic and intronic segments, 5' and 3' flanking regions of IRS2 (_14.5 kb), were bidirectionally sequenced for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in 934 Hispanic children using 3730XL DNA Sequencers. Additionally, 15 SNPs derived from Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChips were analyzed. Measured genotype analysis tested associations between SNPs and obesity and diabetes-related traits. Bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide analysis was used to statistically infer the most likely functional polymorphisms. A total of 140 SNPs were identified with minor allele frequencies (MAF) ranging from 0.001 to 0.47. Forty-two of the 70 coding SNPs result in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions relative to the consensus sequence; 28 SNPs were detected in the promoter, 12 in introns, 28 in the 3'-UTR, and 2 in the 5'-UTR. Two insertion/deletions (indels) were detected. Ten independent rare SNPs (MAF = 0.001-0.009) were associated with obesity-related traits (P = 0.01-0.00002). SNP 10510452_139 in the promoter region was shown to have a high posterior probability (P = 0.77-0.86) of influencing BMI, fat mass, and waist circumference in Hispanic children. SNP 10510452_139 contributed between 2 and 4% of the population variance in body weight and composition. None of the SNPs or indels were associated with diabetes-related traits or accounted for a previously identified quantitative trait locus on chromosome 13 for fasting serum glucose. Rare but not common IRS2 variants may play a role in the regulation of body weight but not an essential role in fasting glucose homeostasis in Hispanic children.",,,4,,,
1981,"Evaluation of the metabochip genotyping array in African Americans and implications for fine mapping of GWAS-identified loci: the PAGE study The Metabochip is a custom genotyping array designed for replication and fine mapping of metabolic, cardiovascular, and anthropometric trait loci and includes low frequency variation content identified from the 1000 Genomes Project. It has 196,725 SNPs concentrated in 257 genomic regions. We evaluated the Metabochip in 5,863 African Americans; 89% of all SNPs passed rigorous quality control with a call rate of 99.9%. Two examples illustrate the value of fine mapping with the Metabochip in African-ancestry populations. At CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1, we found the strongest associated SNP for LDL-C to be rs12740374 (p = 3.5 _ 10(-11)), a SNP indistinguishable from multiple SNPs in European ancestry samples due to high correlation. Its distinct signal supports functional studies elsewhere suggesting a causal role in LDL-C. At CETP we found rs17231520, with risk allele frequency 0.07 in African Americans, to be associated with HDL-C (p = 7.2 _ 10(-36)). This variant is very rare in Europeans and not tagged in common GWAS arrays, but was identified as associated with HDL-C in African Americans in a single-gene study. Our results, one narrowing the risk interval and the other revealing an associated variant not found in Europeans, demonstrate the advantages of high-density genotyping of common and rare variation for fine mapping of trait loci in African American samples.",,,8,,,
1982,"Host and parasite recruitment correlated at a regional scale Drivers of large-scale variability in parasite prevalence are not well understood. For logistical reasons, explorations of spatial patterns in parasites are often performed as observational studies. However, to understand the mechanisms that underlie these spatial patterns, standardized and controlled comparisons are needed. Here, we examined spatial variability in infection of an important fishery species and ecosystem engineer, the oyster (Crassostrea virginica) by its pea crab parasite (Zaops ostreus) across 700 km of the southeastern USA coastline. To minimize the influence of host genetics on infection patterns, we obtained juvenile oysters from a homogeneous source stock and raised them in situ for 3 months at multiple sites with similar environmental characteristics. We found that prevalence of pea crab infection varied between 24 and 73% across sites, but not systematically across latitude. Of all measured environmental variables, oyster recruitment correlated most strongly (and positively) with pea crab infection, explaining 92% of the variability in infection across sites. Our data ostensibly suggest that regional processes driving variation in oyster recruitment similarly affect the recruitment of one of its common parasites.",,,7,,,

1984,"Translating prenatal oral health clinical standards into dental education: results and policy implications OBJECTIVES: To evaluate characteristics of pregnant women served through the University of North Carolina's (UNC) prenatal oral health program (pOHP) dental clinic and community healthcare pathways to inform efforts in promoting prenatal oral health policies. METHODS: The pOHP provides medical and dental students and practitioners with interprofessional experiences caring for pregnant women. A retrospective chart audit captured 314 pregnant women who made appointments over 33 months. Descriptive statistics and bivariate comparisons were computed to assess factors associated with dental appointment attendance and treatment completion. RESULTS: There were 564 pregnant women, with mean age of 29 years and gestation of 25 weeks, referred to the pOHP dental clinic from UNC OB-GYN and 20 community sites. Only 56% (N = 314) scheduled an appointment. Of the 314 appointed women, 55% (N = 172) attended at least one appointment. The majority (87%) presented with acute and/or complex treatment needs. Medicaid status was positively associated with appointment attendance (P = 0.001). Less than half (42%) of the women completed treatment prior to delivery. Mean maternal age, gestational age, and weeks to estimated date of delivery (EDD) were not significantly associated with completed treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides descriptive evidence of an academic, interprofessional program's ability to provide safety-net dental care to pregnant women in the state of North Carolina. Results underscore the need for dental services among pregnant women, signaling for promotion of prenatal oral health clinical standards and informing policy on the state and national levels to maximize dental coverage. _ 2018 American Association of Public Health Dentistry.",,,6,,,
1985,"Adolescents' and adults' perceptions of 'natural', 'organic' and 'additive-free' cigarettes, and the required disclaimers OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate adolescents' and adults' perceptions of an American Spirit advertisement with 'natural', 'organic' and 'additive-free' descriptors and related disclaimers. METHODS: We conducted nine focus group discussions in the Southern USA, with 59 participants aged 13-64__ears (30 male, 29 female), stratified by age, smoking status and susceptibility to smoking. We conducted thematic content analysis of the transcripts. RESULTS: Many participants were sceptical or confused about the 'natural', 'organic' and 'additive-free' descriptors. Many participants viewed American Spirit cigarettes as being less, or possibly less harmful than other cigarettes, even though the ad contained disclaimers explicitly stating that these cigarettes are not safer. Some participants said that people tend to ignore disclaimers, a few expressed doubt that the disclaimers were fully true, and others did not notice the disclaimers. A few smokers said they smoke American Spirit cigarettes because they think they are not as bad for them as other cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Disclaimers intended to prevent consumers from attributing a health benefit to cigarettes labelled as 'natural', 'additive-free', or 'organic' may be insufficient. A ban on these descriptors may be a more appropriate remedy than disclaimers. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

1986,"Public misperception that very low nicotine cigarettes are less carcinogenic OBJECTIVE: The USA is considering a very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarette standard. We sought to characterise the prevalence and correlates of the incorrect belief that VLNC cigarettes are less carcinogenic than current cigarettes, as this could reduce motivation to quit. METHODS: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 650 adult smokers in the USA. In 2015-2016, before the VLNC proposal became public, these smokers took part in an online survey. We used multivariate weighted analyses to calculate ORs and percentages and a _2 test to examine the association between variables. RESULTS: Overall, 47.1% of smokers believed that smoking VLNC cigarettes for 30 years would be less likely to cause cancer than smoking current cigarettes. This misperception was more common among smokers who were aged above 55 (56.6%) and black (57.4%). Additionally, 23.9% of smokers reported they would be less likely to quit if the USA adopted a VLNC standard. Thinking that VLNC cigarettes would be less carcinogenic was associated with smokers reporting they would be less likely to quit (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Many smokers had the misperception that smoking VLNC cigarettes is less likely to cause cancer, and some stated that they would be less likely to quit. A VLNC standard may be more effective if accompanied by a communication campaign that emphasises the continued dangers of smoking VLNC cigarettes due to the many toxic chemicals in smoke. _ Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

1987,"Health and wellness photovoice project: engaging consumers with serious mental illness in health care interventions People with serious mental illnesses (SMI) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. We used photovoice in two supportive housing agencies to engage consumers with SMI to inform the implementation of health care interventions. Sixteen consumers participated in six weekly sessions in which they took photographs about their health and discussed the meanings of these photographs in individual interviews and group sessions. We identified several implementation themes related to consumers' preferences. Peer-based approaches were preferred more than clinician-driven models. Participants expressed a desire to learn practical skills through hands-on activities to modify health behaviors. Consumers expressed a desire to increase their physical activity. Participants revealed in their photographs and narratives the important role that communities' food environments play in shaping eating habits. In this article, we show how photovoice can generate valuable community knowledge to inform the translation of health care interventions in supportive housing agencies.",,,7,,,
1988,"Particulate air pollutants, APOE alleles and their contributions to cognitive impairment in older women and to amyloidogenesis in experimental models Exposure to particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air and its interactions with APOE alleles may contribute to the acceleration of brain aging and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurodegenerative effects of particulate air pollutants were examined in a US-wide cohort of older women from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and in experimental mouse models. Residing in places with fine PM exceeding EPA standards increased the risks for global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia respectively by 81 and 92%, with stronger adverse effects in APOE _4/4 carriers. Female EFAD transgenic mice (5xFAD+/-/human APOE _3 or _4+/+) with 225__ exposure to urban nanosized PM (nPM) over 15 weeks showed increased cerebral _-amyloid by thioflavin S for fibrillary amyloid and by immunocytochemistry for A_ deposits, both exacerbated by APOE _4. Moreover, nPM exposure increased A_ oligomers, caused selective atrophy of hippocampal CA1 neurites, and decreased the glutamate GluR1 subunit. Wildtype C57BL/6 female mice also showed nPM-induced CA1 atrophy and GluR1 decrease. In vitro nPM exposure of neuroblastoma cells (N2a-APP/swe) increased the pro-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We suggest that airborne PM exposure promotes pathological brain aging in older women, with potentially a greater impact in _4 carriers. The underlying mechanisms may involve increased cerebral A_ production and selective changes in hippocampal CA1 neurons and glutamate receptor subunits.",,,3,,,
1989,"Associations of variants In the hexokinase 1 and interleukin 18 receptor regions with oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep Sleep disordered breathing (SDB)-related overnight hypoxemia is associated with cardiometabolic disease and other comorbidities. Understanding the genetic bases for variations in nocturnal hypoxemia may help understand mechanisms influencing oxygenation and SDB-related mortality. We conducted genome-wide association tests across 10 cohorts and 4 populations to identify genetic variants associated with three correlated measures of overnight oxyhemoglobin saturation: average and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep and the percent of sleep with oxyhemoglobin saturation under 90%. The discovery sample consisted of 8,326 individuals. Variants with p < 1 _ 10(-6) were analyzed in a replication group of 14,410 individuals. We identified 3 significantly associated regions, including 2 regions in multi-ethnic analyses (2q12, 10q22). SNPs in the 2q12 region associated with minimum SpO2 (rs78136548 p = 2.70 _ 10(-10)). SNPs at 10q22 were associated with all three traits including average SpO2 (rs72805692 p = 4.58 _ 10(-8)). SNPs in both regions were associated in over 20,000 individuals and are supported by prior associations or functional evidence. Four additional significant regions were detected in secondary sex-stratified and combined discovery and replication analyses, including a region overlapping Reelin, a known marker of respiratory complex neurons.These are the first genome-wide significant findings reported for oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep, a phenotype of high clinical interest. Our replicated associations with HK1 and IL18R1 suggest that variants in inflammatory pathways, such as the biologically-plausible NLRP3 inflammasome, may contribute to nocturnal hypoxemia.",,,8,,,

1991,"Trends and Determinants of Oral Anti-Diabetic Initiation in Youth with Suspected Type 2 Diabetes OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends and identify predictors of treatment initiation of oral anti-diabetic drugs (OAD) in youth. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified a select population of children, ages 8-18 years, with at least 13 months of continuous health plan coverage within the years 2001-2012 in a large US commercial insurance claims database. New use of an OAD was defined as the first claim for an outpatient dispensing following a 12-month wash out period. Treatment incidence was estimated monthly over the study period, and stratified by age, gender, geographic region, and provider specialty. RESULTS: The median size of the source population during the study period was 2.2 million children. A total of 13,824 initiators (mean monthly incidence of 4.6 (95% CI = 3.6, 5.5) per 100,000 youths) were identified. Initiators were more likely to be females, age 15-18, from the southern region, and have visited a family practitioner (versus a general pediatrician) prior to initiation. Time trends demonstrate a 43% increase in initiation from 2002-2012, with a gradual decrease starting from early 2008. CONCLUSION: Incidence of filled OAD medications in youth increased over time, especially for patients treated by family practitioners. Additional research is needed into factors influencing prescribing by family practitioners and pediatricians.",,,4,,,

In a pooled analysis of more than 31,000 women of East-Asian, European, and African ancestry, we found a positive association for rs2046210 and breast cancer risk in Chinese women [ORs (95% CI) = 1.30 (1.22-1.38) and 1.64 (1.50-1.80) for the AG and AA genotypes, respectively, P for trend = 1.54 _ 10____], Japanese women [ORs (95% CI) = 1.31 (1.13-1.52) and 1.37 (1.06-1.76), P for trend = 2.51 _ 10___], and European-ancestry American women [ORs (95% CI) = 1.07 (0.99-1.16) and 1.18 (1.04-1.34), P for trend = 0.0069]. No association with this SNP, however, was observed in African American women [ORs (95% CI) = 0.81 (0.63-1.06) and 0.85 (0.65-1.11) for the AG and AA genotypes, respectively, P for trend = 0.4027]. In vitro functional genomic studies identified a putative functional variant, rs6913578. This SNP is 1,440 bp downstream of rs2046210 and is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2046210 in Chinese (r(2) = 0.91) and European-ancestry (r_ = 0.83) populations, but not in Africans (r_ = 0.57). SNP rs6913578 was found to be associated with breast cancer risk in Chinese and European-ancestry American women. After adjusting for rs2046210, the association of rs6913578 with breast cancer risk in African Americans approached borderline significance. Results from this large consortium study confirmed the association of rs2046210 with breast cancer risk among women of Chinese, Japanese, and European ancestry. This association may be explained in part by a putatively functional variant (rs6913578) identified in the region. _2011 AACR.",,,3,,,
1993,"Violence against health care workers in China, 2013-2016: evidence from the national judgment documents BACKGROUND: Incidents of patient-initiated workplace violence against health care workers have been a subject of substantial public attention in China. Patient-initiated violence not only represents a risk of harm to health care providers but is also indicative of general tensions between doctors and patients which pose a challenge to improving health system access and quality. This study aims to provide a systematic, national-level characterization of serious workplace violence against health care workers in China. METHODS: This study extracted data from the China Judgment Online System, a comprehensive database of judgment documents. Three key phrases, ""criminal case,"" ""health care institution,"" and ""health care worker"" were used to search the China Judgment Online System for relevant cases between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Data extracted from identified cases was used to document the occurrence, the degree of risk, and the factors associated with serious workplace violence. RESULTS: In total, 459 criminal cases involving patient-initiated workplace violence against health care workers in China were reported and processed. The analysis revealed geographic heterogeneity in the occurrence of serious workplace violence, with lower incidence in western provinces compared to central and eastern provinces. Primary hospitals experienced the highest rates of serious workplace violence and emergency departments and doctors were at higher risk compared with other departments and health workers. Perpetrators were primarily male farmers aged 18 to 44 with low levels of education. The most frequently reported reasons of serious patient-initiated workplace violence included perceived medical malpractice by the perpetrator after the death of a patient, death of a patient with no other reason given, failures of the compensation negotiations after the death of a patient, and dissatisfaction with the treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Serious workplace violence against providers varies across regions and types of health care institutions in China. Perception of low-quality care is the most reported reason for violence. Efforts should be made to improve quality of care in the low-level health institutions and strengthen the doctor-patient communication during the whole course of service.",,,1,,,
1994,"Optimal exposure biomarkers for nonpersistent chemicals in environmental epidemiology We discuss considerations that are essential when evaluating exposure to nonpersistent, semivolatile environmental chemicals such as phthalates and phenols (e.g., bisphenol A). A biomarker should be chosen to best represent usual personal exposures and not recent, adventitious, or extraneous exposures. Biomarkers should be selected to minimize contamination arising from collection, sampling, or analysis procedures. Pharmacokinetics should be considered; for example, nonpersistent, semivolatile chemicals are metabolized quickly, and urine is the compartment with the highest concentrations of metabolites. Because these chemicals are nonpersistent, knowledge of intraindividual reliability over the biologic window of interest is also required. In recent years researchers have increasingly used blood as a matrix for characterizing exposure to nonpersistent chemicals. However, the biologic and technical factors noted above strongly support urine as the optimal matrix for measuring nonpersistent, semivolatile, hydrophilic environmental agents.",,,7,,,

1997,"Food Policy Council Self-Assessment Tool: Development, Testing, and Results A large number of food policy councils (FPCs) exist in the United States, Canada, and Tribal Nations (N = 278), yet there are no tools designed to measure their members' perceptions of organizational capacity, social capital, and council effectiveness. Without such tools, it is challenging to determine best practices for FPCs and to measure change within and across councils over time. This study describes the development, testing, and findings from the Food Policy Council Self-Assessment Tool (FPC-SAT). The assessment measures council practices and council members' perceptions of the following concepts: leadership, breadth of active membership, council climate, formality of council structure, knowledge sharing, relationships, member empowerment, community context, synergy, and impacts on the food system. All 278 FPCs listed on the Food Policy Network's Online Directory were recruited to complete the FPC-SAT. Internal reliability (Cronbach's _) and inter-rater reliability (AD, rWG(J), ICC [intraclass correlations][1], ICC[2]) were calculated, and exploratory and a confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Responses from 354 FPC members from 94 councils were used to test the assessment. Cronbach's _ ranged from 0.79 to 0.93 for the scales. FPC members reported the lowest mean scores on the breadth of active membership scale (2.49; standard deviation [SD], 0.62), indicating room for improvement, and highest on the leadership scale (3.45; SD, 0.45).

Multiple large systems, such as health care, the economy, and education, affect chronic disease rates in the United States. System thinking tools can build public health practitioners' capacity to understand these systems and collaborate within and across sectors to improve population health. BOT graphs show a variable, or variables (y axis) over time (x axis). Although analyzing trends is not new to public health, drawing BOT graphs, annotating the events and systemic forces that are likely to influence the depicted trends, and then discussing the graphs in a diverse group provides an opportunity for public health practitioners to hear each other's perspectives and creates a more holistic understanding of the key factors that contribute to a trend. We describe how BOT graphs are used in public health, how they can be used to generate group discussion, and how this process can advance systems-level thinking. Then we describe how BOT graphs were used with groups of maternal and child health (MCH) practitioners and partners (N = 101) during a training session to advance their thinking about MCH challenges. Eighty-six percent of the 84 participants who completed an evaluation agreed or strongly agreed that they would use this BOT graph process to engage stakeholders in their home states and jurisdictions.

1999,"TAS2R38 Predisposition to Bitter Taste Associated with Differential Changes in Vegetable Intake in Response to a Community-Based Dietary Intervention Although vegetable consumption associates with decreased risk for a variety of diseases, few Americans meet dietary recommendations for vegetable intake. TAS2R38 encodes a taste receptor that confers bitter taste sensing from chemicals found in some vegetables. Common polymorphisms in TAS2R38 lead to coding substitutions that alter receptor function and result in the loss of bitter taste perception. Our study examined whether bitter taste perception TAS2R38 diplotypes associated with vegetable consumption in participants enrolled in either an enhanced or a minimal nutrition counseling intervention. DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood cells of study participants (N = 497) and analyzed for polymorphisms. Vegetable consumption was determined using the Block Fruit and Vegetable screener. We tested for differences in the frequency of vegetable consumption between intervention and genotype groups over time using mixed effects models. Baseline vegetable consumption frequency did not associate with bitter taste diplotypes (P = 0.937), however after six months of the intervention, we observed an interaction between bitter taste diplotypes and time (P = 0.046). Participants in the enhanced intervention increased their vegetable consumption frequency (P = 0.020) and within this intervention group, the bitter non-tasters and intermediate-bitter tasters had the largest increase in vegetable consumption. In contrast, in the minimal intervention group, the bitter tasting participants reported a decrease in vegetable consumption. Bitter-non tasters and intermediate-bitter tasters increased vegetable consumption in either intervention more than those who perceive bitterness. Future precision medicine applications could consider genetic variation in bitter taste perception genes when designing dietary interventions. Copyright _ 2018 Calancie et al.",,,4,,,
2000,"Nutrition-related policy and environmental strategies to prevent obesity in rural communities: a systematic review of the literature, 2002-2013 INTRODUCTION: Residents of rural communities in the United States are at higher risk for obesity than their urban and suburban counterparts. Policy and environmental-change strategies supporting healthier dietary intake can prevent obesity and promote health equity. Evidence in support of these strategies is based largely on urban and suburban studies; little is known about use of these strategies in rural communities. The purpose of this review was to synthesize available evidence on the adaptation, implementation, and effectiveness of policy and environmental obesity-prevention strategies in rural settings. METHODS: The review was guided by a list of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the United States, commonly known as the ""COCOMO"" strategies. We searched PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Public Affairs Information Service, and Cochrane databases for articles published from 2002 through 2013 that reported findings from research on nutrition-related policy and environmental strategies in rural communities in the United States and Canada. Two researchers independently abstracted data from each article, and resolved discrepancies by consensus. RESULTS: Of the 663 articles retrieved, 33 met inclusion criteria. The interventions most commonly focused on increasing access to more nutritious foods and beverages or decreasing access to less nutritious options. Rural adaptations included accommodating distance to food sources, tailoring to local food cultures, and building community partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this literature review provide guidance on adapting and implementing policy and environmental strategies in rural communities.",,,7,,,
2001,"System support mapping: A novel systems thinking tool applied to assess the needs of maternal and child health title V professionals and their partners CONTEXT: The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) workforce aims to improve health outcomes for women, children, and families. The work requires coordination and partnerships that span disciplines and service systems. As such, workforce needs assessment requires an approach that is broad, flexible, and ""systems-aware."" OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the use of System Support Mapping, a novel systems thinking tool that was used to guide participants through a structured assessment of their discrete responsibilities, key needs, and specific resources required for each. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four Title V MCH professionals and partners from 15 states or jurisdictions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Description and frequency of Title V MCH professionals' coded roles, responsibilities, needs, resources, and wishes. An aggregated map illustrating interconnections between identified codes is presented. RESULTS: State- and local-level MCH professionals reported a range of roles, responsibilities, needs, resources, and wishes. The most and least frequently reported roles, responsibilities, needs, resources, and wishes by state- and local-level MCH professionals are listed, as well as the most frequent connections between those responses. The most frequent responsibility reported in local maps was ""link to or provide care or resources"" (82%), whereas the most frequent responsibility reported in state maps was ""system management"" (65%). System management was indirectly connected to 3 wishes: ""access to data or information,"" ""funding or resources,"" and ""collaboration, coordination, or support from community or other external organizations."" CONCLUSIONS: System Support Mapping can be used to support needs assessment with MCH professionals. System Support Maps show not only the most and least frequently reported roles, responsibilities, needs, resources, and wishes of participants but also how those responses are connected and potentially interdependent. System Support Maps may be useful for MCH leaders determining how best to organize their teams to take on complex public health challenges and prioritize improvements that will better support their work.",,,2,,,
2002,"Food Policy Council Case Study Describing Cross-sector Collaboration for Food System Change in a Rural Setting PROBLEM: Food Policy Councils (FPCs) are cross-sector collaborations that bring representatives from across the food system together to identify issues, coordinate programs, and inform policy. Little is known about how rural FPCs operate to influence food access in their communities. PURPOSE: To explore how a rural FPC facilitates cross-sector partnerships and influences food system change through interviews with eight members of the Adam's County FPC. RESULTS: Connections developed through the FPC helped council members work more effectively in their home organizations. Four themes were discussed: council dynamics and structure; sharing resources, expertise, and information; promoting healthy food access through programs; and food policy opportunities and challenges. CONCLUSIONS: This case study illustrates connections between FPC members in a rural county and identifies how FPCs can facilitate food system change in their communities. Improving our understanding of how rural FPCs function can help to advance the potential public health impact of councils.",,,2,,,

2004,"Genetic architecture of skewed X inactivation in the laboratory mouse X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the mammalian mechanism of dosage compensation that balances X-linked gene expression between the sexes. Early during female development, each cell of the embryo proper independently inactivates one of its two parental X-chromosomes. In mice, the choice of which X chromosome is inactivated is affected by the genotype of a cis-acting locus, the X-chromosome controlling element (Xce). Xce has been localized to a 1.9 Mb interval within the X-inactivation center (Xic), yet its molecular identity and mechanism of action remain unknown. We combined genotype and sequence data for mouse stocks with detailed phenotyping of ten inbred strains and with the development of a statistical model that incorporates phenotyping data from multiple sources to disentangle sources of XCI phenotypic variance in natural female populations on X inactivation. We have reduced the Xce candidate 10-fold to a 176 kb region located approximately 500 kb proximal to Xist. We propose that structural variation in this interval explains the presence of multiple functional Xce alleles in the genus Mus. We have identified a new allele, Xce(e) present in Mus musculus and a possible sixth functional allele in Mus spicilegus. We have also confirmed a parent-of-origin effect on X inactivation choice and provide evidence that maternal inheritance magnifies the skewing associated with strong Xce alleles. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of 155 laboratory strains and wild mice we conclude that Xce(a) is either a derived allele that arose concurrently with the domestication of fancy mice but prior the derivation of most classical inbred strains or a rare allele in the wild. Furthermore, we have found that despite the presence of multiple haplotypes in the wild Mus musculus domesticus has only one functional Xce allele, Xce(b). Lastly, we conclude that each mouse taxa examined has a different functional Xce allele.",,,1,,,
2005,"The effect of family sex composition on fertility desires and family planning behaviors in urban Uttar Pradesh, India BACKGROUND: A cultural preference for sons has been well documented in India, resulting in skewed sex ratios, especially exhibited in northwest India. Previous research has shown that family sex composition is associated with family planning (FP) use and couples' desire for more children. This study examines family sex composition and fertility and FP behaviors in urban Uttar Pradesh, India; little work has examined these issues in urban settings where family sizes are smaller and FP use is common. METHODS: Data for this analysis comes from a 2010 representative survey of married, non-pregnant fecund women aged 15-49 from six cities in Uttar Pradesh, India. Multivariate analyses are used to examine the association between family sex composition and fertility desires and FP use. RESULTS: The multivariate results indicate that family sex composition is associated with fertility desires and FP use. Women without living children and without at least one child of each sex are significantly less likely to want no more children and women with both sons and daughters but more sons are significantly more likely to want no more children as compared to women that have both sons and daughters but more daughters. Women with no living children and women with daughters but no sons are less likely to be modern FP users than nonusers whereas women with both sons and daughters but more sons are more likely to be modern FP users than nonusers as compared to women with both sons and daughters but more daughters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that family sex composition affects fertility behavior and also reveals that preference for sons persists in urban Uttar Pradesh. These results underscore the importance of programs and policies that work to enhance the value of girl children.",,,3,,,
2006,"The effect of the removal of user fees for delivery at public health facilities on institutional delivery in urban kenya Objectives In 2013, Kenya removed delivery fees at public health facilities in an effort to promote equity in access to health services and address high maternal mortality. This study determines the effect of the policy to remove user fees on institutional delivery in a population-based sample of women from urban Kenya. Methods Longitudinal data were collected from a representative sample of 8500 women from five cities in Kenya in 2010 with a follow-up interview in 2014 (response rate 58.9%). Respondents were asked about their most recent birth since 2008_at baseline and 2012_at endline, including the delivery location. Multinomial logistic regression is used, controlling for the temporal time trend and background characteristics, to determine if births which occurred after the national policy change were more likely to occur at a public facility than at home or a private facility. Results Multivariate findings show that women were significantly more likely to deliver at a public facility as compared to a private facility after the policy. Among the poor, the results show that poor women were significantly more likely to deliver in a public facility compared to home or a private facility after policy change. Conclusions for Practice These findings show Kenya's progress towards achieving universal access to delivery services and meeting its national development targets. The removal of delivery fees in the public sector is leading to increased use of facilities for delivery among the urban poor; this is an important first step in reducing maternal death.",,,2,,,
2007,"Provider imposed restrictions to clients' access to family planning in urban Uttar Pradesh, India: a mixed methods study BACKGROUND: Medical barriers refer to unnecessary policies or procedures imposed by health care providers that are not necessarily medically advised; these restrictions impede clients' access to family planning (FP). This mixed methods study investigates provider imposed barriers to provision of FP using recent quantitative and qualitative data from urban Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS: Baseline quantitative data were collected in six cities in Uttar Pradesh, India from service delivery points (SDP), using facility audits, exit interviews, and provider surveys; for this study, the focus is on the provider surveys. More than 250 providers were surveyed in each city. Providers were asked about the FP methods they provide, and if they restrict clients' access to each method based on age, parity, partner consent, or marital status. For the qualitative research, we conducted one-on-one interviews with 21 service providers in four of the six cities in Uttar Pradesh. Each interview lasted approximately 45 minutes. RESULTS: The quantitative findings show that providers restrict clients' access to spacing and long-acting and permanent methods of FP based on age, parity, partner consent and marital status. Qualitative findings reinforce that providers, at times, make judgments about their clients' education, FP needs and ability to understand FP options thereby imposing unnecessary barriers to FP methods. CONCLUSIONS: Provider restrictions on FP methods are common in these urban Uttar Pradesh sites. This means that women who are young, unmarried, have few or no children, do not have the support of their partner, or are less educated may not be able to access or use FP or their preferred method. These findings highlight the need for in-service training for staff, with a focus on reviewing current guidelines and eligibility criteria for provision of methods.",,,2,,,
2008,"Physician support of HPV vaccination school-entry requirements School-entry requirements in the US have led to high coverage for several vaccines, but few states and jurisdictions have adopted these policies for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Because physicians play a key role in advocating for vaccination policies, we assessed physician support of requiring HPV vaccine for school entry and correlates of this support. Participants were a national sample of 775 physicians who provide primary care, including vaccines, to adolescents. Physicians completed an online survey in 2014 that assessed their support for school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination of 11 and 12 y olds. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess correlates of support for these requirements. The majority of physicians (74%) supported some form of school-entry requirements, with or without opt-out provisions. When opt-out provisions were not specified, 47% agreed that laws requiring HPV vaccination for school attendance were a ""good idea."" Physicians more often agreed with requirements, without opt-out provisions, if they: had more years in practice (OR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.09-2.04), gave higher quality HPV vaccine recommendations (OR=2.06; 95% CI: 1.45-2.93), believed that having requirements for Tdap, but not HPV, vaccination undermined its importance (OR=3.33; 95% CI: 2.26-4.9), and believed HPV vaccination was as or more important than other adolescent vaccinations (OR=2.30; 95% CI: 1.65-3.18). In conclusion, we found that many physicians supported school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination. More research is needed to investigate the extent to which opt-out provisions might weaken or strengthen physician support of HPV vaccination school-entry requirements.",,,0,,,
2009,"The History of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Rheumatology The rheumatology community began incorporating patient-reported outcomes in the early 1980s, helping shift the care of chronic diseases from a narrower biomedical model to a broader biopsychosocial model of health.

2011,"Public Health Interventions for Osteoarthritis - updates on the Osteoarthritis Action Alliance's efforts to address the 2010 OA Public Health Agenda Recommendations Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful joint disease affecting more than 32.5 million adults in the US and over 350 million adults worldwide. The prevalence is expected to rise continually over the next several decades with significant impacts to societal health and economic costs as well as individuals' daily activities and quality of life. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Arthritis Foundation (AF) led a collaborative effort to address approaches to reduce the burden of OA via public health interventions, policies (systems and environmental), and communication strategies. This collaboration resulted in the National Public Health Agenda for OA (OA Agenda), which was vetted by more than 75 stakeholder organisations and released in 2010. The OA Agenda listed ten recommendations focused on public health interventions for OA including weight management, physical activity, self-management education, and injury prevention, and policies, systems, communication, research and evaluation. In 2011, the CDC and AF mobilised the OA Action Alliance (OAAA), a national coalition of organisations concerned with mitigating the public health impact of OA, to operationalise the recommendations set forth in the OA Agenda. Since then, the OAAA has grown to include more than 110 organisations that work collectively to increase awareness about the prevention and management of OA, provide educational resources, and expand access to evidence-based programmes for target audiences including individuals with OA, community-based organisations, healthcare systems and providers, and policymakers. This review highlights the OAAA's progress to date in addressing the OA Agenda recommendations; successes and challenges in delivery of effective communication, programmes, and resources; and future implications.",,,9,,,
2012,"Associations of educational attainment, occupation and community poverty with knee osteoarthritis in the Johnston County (North Carolina) osteoarthritis project INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to examine data from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis (OA) Project for independent associations of educational attainment, occupation and community poverty with tibiofemoral knee OA. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 3,591 individuals (66% Caucasian and 34% African American). Educational attainment (< 12 years or _12 years), occupation (non-managerial or not), and census block group household poverty rate (< 12%, 12 to 25%, > 25%) were examined separately and together in logistic models adjusting for covariates of age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking, knee injury and occupational activity score. Outcomes were presence of radiographic knee OA (rOA), symptomatic knee OA (sxOA), bilateral rOA and bilateral sxOA. RESULTS: When all three socioeconomic status (SES) variables were analyzed simultaneously, low educational attainment was significantly associated with rOA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20, 1.73), bilateral rOA (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.13, 1.81), and sxOA (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.34, 2.06), after adjusting for covariates. Independently, living in a community of high household poverty rate was associated with rOA (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.43, 2.36), bilateral rOA (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.12, 2.16), and sxOA (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.00, 1.83). Occupation had no significant independent association beyond educational attainment and community poverty. CONCLUSIONS: Both educational attainment and community SES were independently associated with knee OA after adjusting for primary risk factors for knee OA.",,,9,,,
2013,"Adaptation of the health literacy universal precautions toolkit for rheumatology and cardiology - applications for pharmacy professionals to improve self-management and outcomes in patients with chronic disease Over a decade of research in health literacy has provided evidence of strong links between literacy skills of patients and health outcomes. At the same time, numerous studies have yielded insight into efficacious action that health providers can take to mitigate the negative effects of limited literacy. This small study focuses on the adaptation, review and use of two new health literacy toolkits for health professionals who work with patients with two of the most prevalent chronic conditions, arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Pharmacists have a key role in communicating with patients and caregivers about various aspects of disease self-management, which frequently includes appropriate use of medications. Participating pharmacists and staff offered suggestions that helped shape revisions and reported positive experiences with brown bag events, suggestions for approaches with patients managing chronic diseases, and with concrete examples related to several medicines [such as Warfarin(_)] as well as to common problems [such as inability to afford needed medicine]. Although not yet tested in community pharmacy sites, these publically available toolkits can inform professionals and staff and offer insights for communication improvement.

2014,"Independent and combined influence of homeownership, occupation, education, income, and community poverty on physical health in persons with arthritis OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent and combined influence of individual- and community-level socioeconomic status (SES) measures on physical health status outcomes in people with self-reported arthritis. METHODS: From 2004-2005, 968 participants completed a telephone survey assessing health status, chronic conditions, community characteristics, and sociodemographic variables. Individual-level SES measures used included homeownership, occupation (professional or not), educational attainment (less than high school, high school degree, and more than high school), and income (< $15,000, $15,000-$45,000, and >$45,000). Community poverty (2000 US Census block group percentage of individuals living below the poverty line [low, medium, and high]) was used as a community-level SES measure. Outcomes were physical functioning (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 version 2 physical component summary [PCS]), functional disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Healthy Days physical and limited activity days, and were analyzed via multivariable regressions. RESULTS: When entered separately, all individual-level SES variables were significantly (P < 0.01) associated with poorer PCS, HAQ, and CDC HRQOL scores. A higher magnitude of effect was seen for household income, specifically < $15,000 per year in final models with all 4 individual SES measures and community poverty. The magnitude of effect for education is reduced and marginally significant for the PCS and number of physically unhealthy days. No effects were seen for occupation, homeownership, and community poverty. CONCLUSION: Findings confirm that after adjusting for important covariates, lower individual- and community-level SES measures are associated with poorer physical health outcomes, while household income is the strongest predictor (as measured by both significance and effect) of poorer health status in final models. Studies not having participant-reported income available should make use of other SES measures, as they do independently predict physical health.

2015,"Evaluation of the arthritis foundation's camine con gusto program for hispanic adults with arthritis INTRODUCTION: Camine Con Gusto (CCG) is the Hispanic version of an evidence-based walking program for people with arthritis. This study examined CCG outcomes, feasibility, tolerability, safety, and acceptability and potential tailoring. METHOD: A pre and post 6-week evaluation was conducted in Hispanic people with arthritis. Outcomes included pain, stiffness, fatigue, functional capacity, helplessness, and self-efficacy. A formative evaluation with program participants and key stakeholders explored program tailoring. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 46.9 years, 44.4% had a high school degree or less, 2.5% were born in United States, 60.1% spoke only Spanish, and 74.7% were female. Moderate effect sizes were found: 0.50 for pain, 0.75 for fatigue, 0.49 for stiffness, 0.33 for function, 0.26 for helplessness, and 0.24 for self-efficacy. There were 285 participants recruited with an 82% 6-week retention (feasibility), no adverse events were reported (safety), and 98% reported program satisfaction (acceptability). Recommended adaptations included simpler language, more pictures and content addressing nutrition and chronic conditions, shortened materials, and inclusion of motivational strategies.

2016,"Limited educational attainment and radiographic and symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: a cross-sectional analysis using data from the Johnston County (North Carolina) Osteoarthritis Project INTRODUCTION: Applying a cross-sectional analysis to a sample of 2,627 African-American and Caucasian adults aged > or = 45 years from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project, we studied the association between educational attainment and prevalence of radiographic knee osteoarthritis and symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Age- and race-adjusted associations between education and osteoarthritis outcomes were assessed by gender-stratified logistic regression models, with additional models adjusting for body mass index, knee injury, smoking, alcohol use, and occupational factors. RESULTS: In an analysis of all participants, low educational attainment (< 12 years) was associated with higher prevalence of four knee osteoarthritis outcomes (unilateral and bilateral radiographic and symptomatic osteoarthritis). Women with low educational attainment had 50% higher odds of having radiographic knee osteoarthritis and 65% higher odds of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis compared with those with higher educational attainment (> or = 12 years), by using fully adjusted models. In the subset of postmenopausal women, these associations tended to be weaker but little affected by adjustment for hormone replacement therapy. Men with low educational attainment had 85% higher odds of having symptomatic knee osteoarthritis by using fully adjusted models, but the association with radiographic knee osteoarthritis was explained by age. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for known risk factors, educational attainment, as an indicator of socioeconomic status, is associated with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in both men and women and with radiographic knee osteoarthritis in women.",,,9,,,

2019,"Coaching primary care clinics for HPV vaccination quality improvement: Comparing in-person and webinar implementation State health departments commonly use quality improvement coaching as an implementation strategy for improving low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage, but such coaching can be resource intensive. To explore opportunities for improving efficiency, we compared in-person and webinar delivery of coaching sessions on implementation outcomes, including reach, acceptability, and delivery cost. In 2015, we randomly assigned 148 high-volume primary care clinics in Illinois, Michigan, and Washington State to receive either in-person or webinar coaching. Coaching sessions lasted about 1 hr and used our Immunization Report Card to facilitate assessment and feedback. Clinics served over 213,000 patients ages 11-17. We used provider surveys and delivery cost assessment to collect implementation data. This report is focused exclusively on the implementation aspects of the intervention. More providers attended in-person than webinar coaching sessions (mean 9 vs. 5 providers per clinic, respectively, p = .004). More providers shared the Immunization Report Card at clinic staff meetings in the in-person than webinar arm (49% vs. 20%; p = .029). In both arms, providers' belief that their clinics' HPV vaccination coverage was too low increased, as did their self-efficacy to help their clinics improve (p < .05). Providers rated coaching sessions in the two arms equally highly on acceptability. Delivery cost per clinic was $733 for in-person coaching versus $461 for webinar coaching. In-person and webinar coaching were well received and yielded improvements in provider beliefs and self-efficacy regarding HPV vaccine quality improvement. In summary, in-person coaching cost more than webinar coaching per clinic reached, but reached more providers. Further implementation research is needed to understand how and for whom webinar coaching may be appropriate.",,,0,,,
2020,"A content analysis of HPV vaccination messages available online Parents have varied HPV vaccine communication needs, which presents a challenge for healthcare providers. To improve communication resources for providers, we sought to characterize HPV vaccination messages available in existing educational materials. In fall 2016, we searched PubMed, educational material clearinghouses, and Google for English language HPV vaccination messages. We extracted messages that a provider might use when raising the topic of HPV vaccination, answering common questions, and motivating vaccination. Two reviewers independently coded each message. The search identified 267 unique messages about HPV vaccination. Messages generally were long (mean no. of words_=_44, standard deviation [SD]_=_33) and required a high level of education to read (mean reading grade level_=_10, SD_=_3). Only 32% of messages were shorter than 25 words, and 12% had a readability at or below grade 6. Most frequent were messages to address common parent questions or concerns (62%); the most common topics were diseases prevented by HPV vaccine (18%) and safety and side effects (16%). Many messages included information about cancer prevention (26%) and same-day vaccination (13%). Few messages (6%) used a presumptive style to recommend HPV vaccination. In conclusion, available messages about HPV vaccination were markedly varied. We identified few messages that were both brief (to facilitate providers memorizing them) and accessible (to facilitate parents understanding them). Future research should identify which messages lead to HPV vaccine uptake. Copyright _ 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,0,,,
2021,"Parents' willingness to get human papillomavirus vaccination for their adolescent children at a pharmacy Pharmacies are promising alternative settings for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination because of their accessibility and existing infrastructure for vaccine delivery. We sought to examine parents' willingness to get HPV vaccination for their children at pharmacies. In 2014, we conducted a national, online survey of 1255 parents of 11- to 17-year-old adolescents in the United States. We used multivariable logistic regression to model parents' willingness for getting HPV vaccinations in pharmacies. Overall, 29% of parents would be willing to get HPV vaccine for their children at a pharmacy. Parental willingness was associated with believing that pharmacists are skilled at administering vaccines (OR=2.05, 95% CI:1.68-2.51), HPV vaccine was at least as important as other adolescent vaccines (OR=1.48, 95% CI:1.10-1.98), and getting vaccines in pharmacies would give children more opportunities to get health care (OR=2.17, 95% CI:1.63-2.89). Parental willingness was also more common among parents of adolescents ages 13-17 or who had already initiated the HPV vaccine series. Parents most often indicated that they would like to learn about HPV vaccination in pharmacies from their children's doctor (37%). Offering HPV vaccine in pharmacies may increase uptake as a meaningful number of parents would get the vaccine for their children in these settings. Physician referrals for completing the HPV vaccine series may serve as an important source for increasing awareness of and demand for adolescent vaccination services in pharmacies.

2022,"Parents' Support for School-Entry Requirements for Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: A National Study BACKGROUND: The number of states proposing school-entry requirements for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has increased over the last decade. However, data are currently limited regarding parents' support of such laws. We sought to obtain the first national estimates of parents' support of HPV vaccination school-entry requirements. METHODS: A national sample of 1,501 parents of 11- to 17-year-old children completed a web-based survey between November 2014 and January 2015. Analyses used multivariable logistic regression to assess correlates of support for school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination. RESULTS: Overall, 21% of parents agreed that laws requiring HPV vaccination for school attendance ""are a good idea,"" and 54% disagreed. If school-entry requirements included opt-out provisions, agreement increased to 57%, and only 21% disagreed. Parents more often agreed with requirements without opt-out provisions if they were Hispanic [OR = 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-2.22], believed HPV vaccine was as or more important than other adolescent vaccines (OR = 2.76; 95% CI, 1.98-3.83), or believed HPV vaccine was effective for preventing cervical cancer (OR = 2.55; 95% CI, 1.93-3.37). Parents less often agreed if they resided in Midwest states or believed that HPV vaccine was being pushed to make money for drug companies (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Opt-out provisions almost tripled parents' support for HPV vaccine school-entry requirements. Our findings suggest that race/ethnicity, attitudes about HPV vaccine, and region of residence may influence support for requirements without opt-out provisions. IMPACT: Opt-out provisions greatly increase parent support of school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination but may make them ineffective.

2023,"Implementing pharmacy-located HPV vaccination: findings from pilot projects in five U.S. states Pharmacies are promising alternative settings for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination because of their population reach, convenience, and existing infrastructure for vaccine delivery. However, pharmacies in the US are rarely used for adolescent HPV vaccination. We sought to document challenges and opportunities of implementing pharmacy-located HPV vaccination services in five US states by mapping process evaluation results onto key implementation science constructs: service penetration, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, adoption, and sustainability. Pilot projects were planned in North Carolina (k_=_2 pharmacies), Michigan (k_=_10), Iowa (k_=_2), Kentucky (k_=_1), and Oregon (no pharmacy recruited) with varying procedures and recruitment strategies. Sites had open enrollment for a combined 12_months. Despite substantial efforts in these states, only 13 HPV vaccine doses were administered to adolescents and three doses to age-eligible young adults. We identified two major reasons for these underperforming results. First, poor outcomes on service penetration and appropriateness pointed to engagement barriers: low parent demand and engagement among pharmacy staff. Second, poor outcomes on feasibility, adoption, and sustainability appeared to result from administrative hurdles: lacking third party reimbursement (i.e., billing commercial payers, participation in Vaccines for Children program) and limited integration into primary care systems. In summary, pilot projects in five states all struggled to administer HPV vaccines. Opportunities for making pharmacies a successful setting for adolescent HPV vaccination include expanding third party reimbursement to cover all vaccines administered by pharmacists, increasing public awareness of pharmacists' immunization training, and improving care coordination with primary care providers.",,,0,,,

2025,"Anxious-depression among Hispanic/Latinos from different backgrounds: results from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) BACKGROUND: Anxious-depression is a constellation of symptoms, frequently encountered among patients in primary care centers. There is a need to study how anxious-depression presents among Hispanic/Latinos of different backgrounds. OBJECTIVE: To study the construct of anxious-depression among 16,064 Hispanic/Latinos of different backgrounds participating in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. We hypothesized that Hispanic/Latinos will cluster in 3 classes: low anxiety/high depression, high anxiety/low depression and a combined anxious-depression construct. METHODS: Using latent profile analysis, symptoms of depression and anxiety measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and 10-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were evaluated to determine if an anxious-depression typology would result. A multinomial logistic regression analysis explored the association of the 3-class solution with different Hispanic/Latino backgrounds controlling for age, gender, language, education and income. RESULTS: A 3-class mixed anxious-depression structure emerged with 10% of Hispanic/Latinos in the high, 30% in the moderate and 60% in the low anxious-depression category. After adjusting for age, gender, language preference, income and education, individuals of Puerto Rican background were more likely to experience high (OR = 1.79, p < 0.05) and moderate (OR = 1.36, p < 0.05) (vs. low) anxious-depression symptomatology compared to those of Mexican background. Individuals of Central American and South American background were less likely to experience high (OR = 0.68, p < 0.05) and moderate (OR = 0.8, p < 0.05) (vs. low) anxious-depression compared to those of Mexican background.

We hypothesized an inverse association of anxious depression with neurocognition among Hispanics of different heritage. DESIGN: Data are from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. The sample included 9,311participants aged 45-74 years (mean: 56.5 years). A latent class analysis of items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression scale and the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to derive an anxious depression construct. Neurocognitive measures included scores on the Brief Spanish English Verbal Learning Test (B-SEVLT, learning and recall trials), Word Fluency (WF), Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) test, and a Global Cognitive Score (GCS). We fit survey linear regression models to test the associations between anxious depression symptomatology and cognitive function. We tested for effect modification by sex, Hispanic heritage, and age groups. RESULTS: Among men, 71.6% reported low, 23.3% moderate, and 5.1% high ADS. Among women, 55.1% reported low, 33.2% moderate, and 11.8% high ADS. After controlling for age, sex, sociodemographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors and disease, and antidepressant use, we found significant inverse associations between moderate and high anxious depression (ref:low) with B-SEVLT learning and recall, DSS and GCS. Moderate, but not high, anxious depression was inversely associated with WF. Associations were not modified by sex, Hispanic heritage, or age. CONCLUSIONS: Increased anxious depression symptomatology is associated with decreased neurocognitive function among Hispanics. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish temporality and infer if negative emotional symptoms precede cognitive deficits. Copyright _ 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

2027,"Heterogeneity of p53 dependent genomic responses following ethanol exposure in a developmental mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder Prenatal ethanol exposure can produce structural and functional deficits in the brain and result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). In rodent models acute exposure to a high concentration of alcohol causes increased apoptosis in the developing brain. A single causal molecular switch that signals for this increase in apoptosis has yet to be identified. The protein p53 has been suggested to play a pivotal role in enabling cells to engage in pro-apoptotic processes, and thus figures prominently as a hub molecule in the intracellular cascade of responses elicited by alcohol exposure. In the present study we examined the effect of ethanol-induced cellular and molecular responses in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and hippocampus of 7-day-old wild-type (WT) and p53-knockout (KO) mice. We quantified apoptosis by active caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and ApopTag_ labeling, then determined total RNA expression levels in laminae of SI and hippocampal subregions. Immunohistochemical results confirmed increased incidence of apoptotic cells in both regions in WT and KO mice following ethanol exposure. The lack of p53 was not protective in these brain regions. Molecular analyses revealed a heterogeneous response to ethanol exposure that varied depending on the subregion, and which may go undetected using a global approach. Gene network analyses suggest that the presence or absence of p53 alters neuronal function and synaptic modifications following ethanol exposure, in addition to playing a classic role in cell cycle signaling. Thus, p53 may function in a way that underlies the intellectual and behavioral deficits observed in FASD.",,,7,,,
2028,"A theory-based online health behaviour intervention for new university students (U@Uni:LifeGuide): results from a repeat randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND: This paper reports the results of a repeat trial assessing the effectiveness of an online theory-based intervention to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours in new university students. The original trial found that the intervention reduced the number of smokers at 6-month follow-up compared with the control condition, but had non-significant effects on the other targeted health behaviours. However, the original trial suffered from low levels of engagement, which the repeat trial sought to rectify. METHODS: Three weeks before staring university, all incoming undergraduate students at a large university in the UK were sent an email inviting them to participate in the study. After completing a baseline questionnaire, participants were randomly allocated to intervention or control conditions. The intervention consisted of a self-affirmation manipulation, health messages based on the theory of planned behaviour and implementation intention tasks. Participants were followed-up 1 and 6 months after starting university. The primary outcome measures were portions of fruit and vegetables consumed, physical activity levels, units of alcohol consumed and smoking status at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The study recruited 2,621 students (intervention n=1346, control n=1275), of whom 1495 completed at least one follow-up (intervention n=696, control n=799). Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that the intervention had a non-significant effect on the primary outcomes, although the effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake was significant in the per-protocol analyses. Secondary analyses revealed that the intervention had significant effects on having smoked at university (self-report) and on a biochemical marker of alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Despite successfully increasing levels of engagement, the intervention did not have a significant effect on the primary outcome measures. The relatively weak effects of the intervention, found in both the original and repeat trials, may be due to the focus on multiple versus single health behaviours. Future interventions targeting the health behaviour of new university students should therefore focus on single health behaviours.

2029,"The impact of positive affect on health cognitions and behaviours: a meta-analysis of the experimental evidence Several reviews suggest that positive affect is associated with improved longevity, fewer physical symptoms, and biological indicators of good health. It is possible that positive affect could influence these outcomes by promoting healthful cognitions and behaviours. The present review identified conceptual pathways from positive affect to health cognitions and behaviour, and used random effects meta-analysis to quantify the impact of positive affect inductions (versus neutral affect conditions) on these outcomes. Literature searches located 54 independent tests that could be included in the review. Across all studies, the findings revealed no reliable effects on intentions (d+ = -.12, 95% CI = -.32 to .08, k = 15) or behaviour (d+ = .15, 95% CI = -.03 to .33, k = 23). There were four reliable effects involving specific cognitions and behaviours, but little clear evidence for generalised benefits or adverse effects of positive emotions on health-related cognitions or actions. Conclusions must be cautious given the paucity of tests available for analysis. The review offers suggestions about research designs that might profitably be deployed in future studies, and calls for additional tests of the impact of discrete positive emotions on health cognitions and behaviour.",,,1,,,
2030,"Positive affect and physical activity: Testing effects on goal setting, activation, prioritisation, and attainment OBJECTIVE: The present research tested whether incidental positive affect promotes pursuit of physical activity goals. Four key features of goal pursuit were examined - setting physical activity goals (Study 1), goal activation (Study 2), and goal prioritization and goal attainment (Study 3). DESIGN: Participants (Ns = 80, 81, and 59, in Studies 1-3, respectively) were randomized to positive affect (joy, hope) or neutral affect (control) conditions in each study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaire measures of goal level, goal commitment, and means selection (Study 1); a lexical decision task indexed goal activation (Study 2), a choice task captured goal prioritization and MET minutes quantified goal attainment (Study 3). RESULTS: Study 1 showed that positive affect led to a greater number of intended physical activities, and that joy engendered greater willingness to try activities. In Study 2, a positive affect induction led to heightened activation of the physical activity goal compared to the control condition. The joy induction in Study 3 led to greater physical activity, and a trend towards greater goal prioritization. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that positive affect enhances the pursuit of physical activity goals. Implications for health behavior theories and interventions are outlined.",,,9,,,
2031,"Epstein-Barr Virus, High-Risk Human Papillomavirus and Abnormal Cervical Cytology in a Prospective Cohort of African Female Sex Workers BACKGROUND: High-oncogenic-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is necessary, although insufficient, to promote cervical cancer. Like HPV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common pathogen with the capacity to promote epithelial neoplasms. We examined the association between cervical EBV, hrHPV, and cytology in female sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: Women (n = 332) with known cervical cytology and hrHPV mRNA results were evaluated for cervical EBV DNA by conventional polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated to assess the relationships between EBV, hrHPV, and cervical cytology. Prospective analyses used risk ratios and time-to-event analyses to determine the association of EBV with hrHPV clearance and with abnormal cytology outcomes. RESULTS: Baseline prevalence of hrHPV and EBV was 29% and 19%, respectively. Higher EBV prevalence was found among women with older age, HIV, hrHPV, abnormal cytology, Mycoplasma genitalium infection, smoking habits, younger age at sexual debut, and less frequent condom use. At baseline, women with EBV had a higher prevalence of hrHPV infection than did EBV-negative women (52% vs. 24%; HIV-adjusted PR [95% confidence interval], 1.8 [1.3-2.6]). Epstein-Barr virus-positive women had a higher prevalence than did EBV-negative women of high-grade precancer (15% vs. 2%) and abnormal cytology (37% vs. 15%), although HIV- and hrHPV-adjusted associations were not significant (high-grade precancer: PR, 2.0 [0.7-5.9]; abnormal cytology: PR, 1.4 [0.9-2.2]). In prospective analyses, a marginal association was observed between baseline EBV detection and delayed hrHPV clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a possible role for EBV as a high-risk marker or cofactor for HPV-mediated cervical cancer development.",,,3,,,
2032,"Trends in the incidence of physician-diagnosed mild traumatic brain injury among active duty U.S. military personnel between 1997 and 2007 Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been described as the most common form of traumatic brain injury within military populations; however, few epidemiologic studies have examined incidence rates for mTBI in this population. The objective of this study was to examine trends in the incidence of mTBI among active-duty U.S. service members between 1997 and 2007. Specifically, we were interested in evaluating trends in the incidence rates in relation to the initiation of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A retrospective cohort study was conducted utilizing data extracted from the Defense Medical Surveillance System to identify all incident cases of mTBI within the study population. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence rate of mTBI per 1000 person-years. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to analyze the data. There were 98,012 mTBI cases and 14,956,955 person-years of follow-up, for an overall incidence rate of 6.55 (95% CI 6.51,6.59) per 1000 person-years. There was a steady increase in the mTBI rate over time. The average change in the mTBI rate was 8.5% (95% CI 8.2%,8.8%) per year; however, the rate rose dramatically in the last 2 years of the study period. Overall, for 2006-2007 versus 1997-2005, the rate ratio was 1.61 (95% CI 1.58,1.65). The greatest increase in the rate of mTBI was observed among those serving in Iraq, who experienced a 38.4% (95% CI 35.4%,41.1%) annual increase in new cases. The observed increase in the incidence of mTBI in this population has significant policy implications in terms of allocating appropriate health care resources.",,,9,,,
2033,"Reference values for the marx activity rating scale in a young athletic population: history of knee ligament injury is associated with higher scores BACKGROUND: Activity-related patient-reported outcome measures are an important component of assessment after knee ligament injury in young and physically active patients; however, normative data for most activity scales are limited. OBJECTIVE: To present reference values by sex for the Marx Activity Rating Scale (MARS) within a young and physically active population while accounting for knee ligament injury history and sex. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. METHODS: All incoming freshman entering a US Service Academy in June of 2011 were recruited to participate in this study. MARS was administered to 1169 incoming freshmen (203 women) who consented to participate within the first week of matriculation. All subjects were deemed healthy and medically fit for military service on admission. Subjects also completed a baseline questionnaire that asked for basic demographic information and injury history. We calculated means with standard deviations, medians with interquartile ranges, and percentiles for ordinal and continuous variables, and frequencies and proportions for dichotomous variables. We also compared median scores by sex and history of knee ligament injury using the Kruskal-Wallis test. MARS was the primary outcome of interest. RESULTS: The median MARS score was significantly higher for men when compared with women (_(2) = 13.22, df = 1, P < 0.001) with no prior history of knee ligament injury. In contrast, there was no significant difference in median MARS scores between men and women (_(2) = 0.47, df = 1, P = 0.493) who reported a history of injury. Overall, median MARS scores were significantly higher among those who reported a history of knee ligament injury when compared with those who did not (_(2) = 9.06, df = 1, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Assessing activity as a patient-reported outcome after knee ligament injury is important, and reference values for these instruments need to account for the influence of prior injury and sex. _ 2015 The Author(s).",,,9,,,
2034,"Normative values for the KOOS and WOMAC in a young athletic population: history of knee ligament injury is associated with lower scores BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcome measures to assess clinical outcomes after injury and surgery has become common in treating young athletes with orthopaedic injuries; however, normative data for these measures are limited and often include a wide range of ages and activity levels. PURPOSE: To provide normative data for the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) in a young and athletic population, and to compare scores between participants with a history of knee ligament injury and those with no history. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: We administered the KOOS and WOMAC to 1177 college freshmen entering the United States Military Academy in June 2011. All participants were healthy and had been medically screened to meet the physical induction standards for military service. We calculated means, standard deviations, percentiles, ranges, and interquartile ranges for the KOOS and WOMAC by sex and injury history. We also compared median scale scores for those with a history of knee ligament injury with those with no history using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Among the 1177 participants, 971 were male (age, 18.8 _ 0.9 years), and the remaining 206 were female (age, 18.7 _ 0.8 years). Normative median values and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for the KOOS scale scores among men with no history of knee ligament injury were the following: Symptoms (96.4; IQR, 10.7), Pain (100; IQR, 2.8), Functional Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (100; IQR, 0.0), Sports and Recreation Function (100; IQR, 5.0), and Knee-Related Quality of Life (QOL) (100; IQR, 12.5). For women with no history of knee ligament injury, the KOOS scale scores were the following: Symptoms (92.9; IQR, 14.3), Pain (100; IQR, 5.6), Functional ADL (100; IQR, 2.9), Sports and Recreation Function (100; IQR, 10.0), and Knee-Related QOL (93.8; IQR, 18.8). Among the men, 139 (14%) reported a history of knee ligament injury, while 33 (16%) women also reported a history of injury. All KOOS scale scores and the WOMAC Stiffness and Function scale scores were significantly lower (P < .05) for men who reported a history of knee ligament injury. Similarly, Symptoms, Pain, and Knee-Related QOL on the KOOS and Pain on the WOMAC were significantly lower among women with a history of knee ligament injury. CONCLUSION: Normative values for all KOOS scales suggest a high level of functioning among participants with no history of knee ligament injury. Despite meeting the medical standards for military service, participants with a history of knee ligament injury had significantly lower KOOS and WOMAC scores upon entry to military service.",,,9,,,

2036,"Adult cancer survivorship care: experiences from the LIVESTRONG centers of excellence network BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to characterize survivorship models of care across eight LIVESTRONG Survivorship Center of Excellence (COE) Network sites and to identify barriers and facilitators influencing survivorship care. METHODS: Using the framework of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry were conducted with the COEs. Methods included document reviews, key informant telephone interviews with 39 participants, online Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) surveys with 40 participants, and three site visits. RESULTS: Several overarching themes emerged in qualitative interviews and were substantiated by quantitative methods. Health system factors supporting survivorship care include organization and leadership commitment and program champions at various levels of the health care team. System barriers include reimbursement issues, lack of space, and the need for leadership commitment to support changes in clinical practices as well as having program ""champions"" among clinical staff. Multiple models of care include separate survivorship clinics and integrated models as well as consultative models. COEs' scores on the ACIC survey showed overall ""reasonable support"" for survivorship care; however, the clinical information system domain was least developed. Although the ACIC findings indicated ""reasonable support"" for self-management, the qualitative analysis revealed that self-management support was largely limited to health promotion provided in clinic-based education and counseling sessions, with few COEs providing patients with self-management tools and interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The CCM framework captured experiences and challenges of these COEs and provided insight into the current state of survivorship care in the context of National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers. Findings showed that cancer patients and providers could benefit from clinical information systems that would better identify candidates for survivorship care and provide timely information. In addition, a crucial area for development is self-management support outside of clinical care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Cancer survivors may benefit from learning about the experience and challenges faced by the eight LIVESTRONG Centers of Excellence in developing programs and models for cancer survivorship care, and these findings may inform patient and caregiver efforts to seek, evaluate, and advocate for quality survivorship programs designed to meet their needs.",,,2,,,
2037,"Case-control study of overweight, obesity, and colorectal cancer risk, overall and by tumor microsatellite instability status BACKGROUND: Being overweight or obese is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer, more so for men than for women. Approximately 10%-20% of colorectal tumors display microsatellite instability (MSI), defined as the expansion or contraction of small repeated sequences in the DNA of tumor tissue relative to nearby normal tissue. We evaluated associations between overweight or obesity and colorectal cancer risk, overall and by tumor MSI status. METHODS: The study included 1794 case subjects with incident colorectal cancer who were identified through population-based cancer registries and 2684 of their unaffected sex-matched siblings as control subjects. Recent body mass index (BMI), BMI at age 20 years, and adult weight change were derived from self-reports of height and weight. Tumor MSI status, assessed at as many as 10 markers, was obtained for 69.7% of the case subjects and classified as microsatellite (MS)-stable (0% of markers unstable; n = 913), MSI-low (>0% but < 30% of markers unstable; n = 149), or MSI-high (> or =30% of markers unstable; n = 188). Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Recent BMI, modeled in 5 kg/m(2) increments, was positively associated with risk of colorectal cancer for men and women combined (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.34), for women only (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.32), and for men only (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.47). There was no interaction with sex (P = .22). Recent BMI, per 5 kg/m(2), was positively associated with the risk of MS-stable (OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.24 to 1.54) and MSI-low (OR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.72) colorectal tumors, but not with the risk of MSI-high tumors (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.31). CONCLUSION: The increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with a high BMI might be largely restricted to tumors that display the more common MS-stable phenotype, suggesting further that colorectal cancer etiology differs by tumor MSI status.",,,3,,,

2039,"Efficacy and safety of three antiretroviral regimens for initial treatment of HIV-1: a randomized clinical trial in diverse multinational settings BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral regimens with simplified dosing and better safety are needed to maximize the efficiency of antiretroviral delivery in resource-limited settings. We investigated the efficacy and safety of antiretroviral regimens with once-daily compared to twice-daily dosing in diverse areas of the world. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 1,571 HIV-1-infected persons (47% women) from nine countries in four continents were assigned with equal probability to open-label antiretroviral therapy with efavirenz plus lamivudine-zidovudine (EFV+3TC-ZDV), atazanavir plus didanosine-EC plus emtricitabine (ATV+DDI+FTC), or efavirenz plus emtricitabine-tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate (DF) (EFV+FTC-TDF). ATV+DDI+FTC and EFV+FTC-TDF were hypothesized to be non-inferior to EFV+3TC-ZDV if the upper one-sided 95% confidence bound for the hazard ratio (HR) was _1.35 when 30% of participants had treatment failure. An independent monitoring board recommended stopping study follow-up prior to accumulation of 472 treatment failures. Comparing EFV+FTC-TDF to EFV+3TC-ZDV, during a median 184 wk of follow-up there were 95 treatment failures (18%) among 526 participants versus 98 failures among 519 participants (19%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72-1.27; p_=_0.74). Safety endpoints occurred in 243 (46%) participants assigned to EFV+FTC-TDF versus 313 (60%) assigned to EFV+3TC-ZDV (HR 0.64, CI 0.54-0.76; p< 0.001) and there was a significant interaction between sex and regimen safety (HR 0.50, CI 0.39-0.64 for women; HR 0.79, CI 0.62-1.00 for men; p_=_0.01). Comparing ATV+DDI+FTC to EFV+3TC-ZDV, during a median follow-up of 81 wk there were 108 failures (21%) among 526 participants assigned to ATV+DDI+FTC and 76 (15%) among 519 participants assigned to EFV+3TC-ZDV (HR 1.51, CI 1.12-2.04; p_=_0.007). CONCLUSION: EFV+FTC-TDF had similar high efficacy compared to EFV+3TC-ZDV in this trial population, recruited in diverse multinational settings. Superior safety, especially in HIV-1-infected women, and once-daily dosing of EFV+FTC-TDF are advantageous for use of this regimen for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection in resource-limited countries. ATV+DDI+FTC had inferior efficacy and is not recommended as an initial antiretroviral regimen. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00084136.

2040,"Incidence of heart failure observed in emergency departments, ambulatory clinics, and hospitals Reports on the burden of heart failure (HF) have largely omitted HF diagnosed in outpatient settings. We quantified annual incidence rates ([IR] per 1,000 person years) of HF identified in ambulatory clinics, emergency departments (EDs), and during hospital stays in a national probability sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 to 2014, by age and race/ethnicity. A 20% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries ages _65 years with continuous Medicare Parts A, B, and D coverage was used to estimate annual IRs of HF identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Of the 681,487 beneficiaries with incident HF from 2008 to 2014, 283,451 (41%) presented in ambulatory clinics, 76,919 (11%) in EDs, and 321,117 (47%) in hospitals. Overall, incidence of HF in ambulatory clinics decreased from 2008 (IR 22.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0, 22.4) to 2014 (IR 15.0, 95% CI 14.8, 15.1). Similarly, incidence of HF-related ED visits without an admission to the hospital decreased somewhat from 2008 (IR 5.5, 95% CI 5.4, 5.6) to 2012 (IR 4.2, 95% CI 4.1, 4.3) and stabilized from 2013 to 2014. Similar to previous reports, HF hospitalizations, both International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 428.x in the primary and any position, decreased over the study period. More than half of all new cases of HF in Medicare beneficiaries presented in an ambulatory clinic or ED. The overall incidence of HF decreased from 2008 to 2014, regardless of health-care setting. In conclusion, consideration of outpatient HF is warranted to better understand the burden of HF and its temporal trends. Copyright _ 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,9,,,
2041,"Accuracy of Self-Reported Heart Failure. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to estimate agreement of self-reported heart failure (HF) with physician-diagnosed HF and compare the prevalence of HF according to method of ascertainment. METHODS AND RESULTS: ARIC cohort members (60-83 years of age) were asked annually whether a physician indicated that they have HF. For those self-reporting HF, physicians were asked to confirm their patients' HF status. Physician-diagnosed HF included surveillance of hospitalized HF and hospitalized and outpatient HF identified in administrative claims databases. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value, kappa, prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK), and prevalence. Compared with physician-diagnosed HF, sensitivity of self-report was low (28%-38%) and specificity was high (96%-97%). Agreement was poor (kappa 0.32-0.39) and increased when adjusted for prevalence and bias (PABAK 0.73-0.83). Prevalence of HF measured by self-report (9.0%), ARIC-classified hospitalizations (11.2%), and administrative hospitalization claims (12.7%) were similar. When outpatient HF claims were included, prevalence of HF increased to 18.6%. CONCLUSIONS: For accurate estimates HF burden, self-reports of HF are best confirmed by means of appropriate diagnostic tests or medical records. Our results highlight the need for improved awareness and understanding of HF by patients, because accurate patient awareness of the diagnosis may enhance management of this common condition.

2042,"Smoking behaviors and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity in older adults: the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study BACKGROUND: Though smoking is strongly associated with peripheral vascular disease and arteriosclerosis, smoking's association with arterial stiffness has been inconsistent and mostly limited to a single arterial segment. We examined the relationship between smoking behaviors with arterial stiffness in multiple arterial segments among community dwelling older adults. METHODS: The cross-sectional relationship between smoking behavior with carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (faPWV) was examined in 5,002 men and women, separately, of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study. Brachial-ankle PWV was also assessed and presented in Supplementary Material. Heckman selection models were used to control for selective attrition and death in the ARIC cohort. RESULTS: In women, faPWV was lower in current smokers compared to never smokers (-66.0cm/s; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): -94.6, -37.4), and was 1.0cm/s lower (95% CI: -1.8, -0.2) for every additional year a woman smoked, after adjustment for confounders. Among women, cfPWV was not associated with smoking status or cigarette pack-years. Additionally, no associations of smoking status and cigarette pack-years with PWV were observed among men. Years since smoking cessation was not associated with PWV in either gender. CONCLUSION: Both smoking status and cumulative smoking exposure were associated with lower peripheral arterial stiffness among women, but not among men. We did not observe an association between central arterial stiffness and smoking status in either gender. The profound and well-documented adverse effects of cigarette smoking on the vasculature may not include a sustained stiffening of the arteries measured at older age. _ American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2015.

2043,"The association of acculturation with accelerometer-assessed and self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos The adoption of US culture among immigrants has been associated with higher leisure-time physical activity and sedentary behavior. However, most research to date assesses this association using single measures of acculturation and physical activity. Our objective was to describe the cross-sectional association between acculturation and both physical activity and sedentary behavior among US Hispanic/Latino adults. Participants included Hispanic/Latinos 18-74_years living in four US locations enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos from 2008 to 2011. Acculturation was measured using acculturation scales (language and social), years in the US, language preference, and age at immigration. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were measured using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (N_=_15,355) and Actical accelerometer (N_=_11,954). Poisson, logistic, and linear regression were used, accounting for complex design and sampling weights. English-language preference was positively associated with self-reported leisure-time and transportation physical activity and accelerometer-assessed moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Social acculturation was positively associated with self-reported leisure-time and transportation physical activity and MVPA. Years in the US and age at immigration were positively associated with accelerometer-assessed MVPA. Language acculturation, years in the US, and age at immigration were associated with occupational physical activity among those who reported employment. Most acculturation measures were associated with self-reported sitting but not with accelerometer-assessed sedentary behavior. Different measures of acculturation, capturing various domains acculturation, were associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior. However, the direction of the association was dependent on the measures of acculturation physical activity/sedentary behavior, highlighting the complexity of these relationships. _ 2020 The Authors.",,,9,,,
2044,"Perceived pubertal timing and recent substance use among adolescents: a longitudinal perspective AIMS: To determine the longitudinal associations between perceived pubertal timing and recent substance use between the ages of 11 and 17 years. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A school-based cohort sequential study of adolescents in rural North Carolina, USA (n = 6892, 50% female) in the 6-8th grades at baseline and interviewed across five consecutive semesters. MEASUREMENTS: Self-administered questionnaires in a group setting measured perceived pubertal development using the Pubertal Development Scale and adolescents reported past 3-month use of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana. Latent class growth analysis determined the longitudinal relationships between perceived pubertal timing (early, on-time and late) and use of the three substances. FINDINGS: A negative quadratic model was the best-fitting model for all three substances. Higher proportions of early developers had used cigarettes and marijuana within the past 3 months at age 11 compared with on-time (P < 0.001 and P = 0.013) and late developers (P = 0.010 and P = 0.014) and a higher proportion of early developers had recently used alcohol at age 11 compared with on-time adolescents (P < 0.001). However, the proportion of recent cigarette and marijuana users increased more across adolescence for on-time adolescents compared with early developers (P = 0.020 and P = 0.037). Desistance in the proportion of substance users was similar for all adolescents (all P > 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who believe they are more advanced in puberty than their peers are more likely to have used cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana recently compared with adolescents who believe they are on-time or late developing; these findings are mainly due to differences in use at age 11. _ 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction.",,,3,,,
2045,"Current opportunities to catalyze research in nutrition and cancer prevention - an interdisciplinary perspective Cancer Research UK and Ludwig Cancer Research convened an inaugural international Cancer Prevention and Nutrition Conference in London on December 3-4, 2018. Much of the discussion focused on the need for systematic, interdisciplinary approaches to better understand the relationships of nutrition, exercise, obesity and metabolic dysfunction with cancer development. Scientists at the meeting underscored the importance of studying the temporal natural history of exposures that may cumulatively impact cancer risk later in life.A robust dialogue identified obesity as a major risk for cancer, and the food environment, especially high energy and low nutrient processed foods, as strong and prevalent risk factors for obesity. Further engagement highlighted challenges in the post-diagnostic setting, where similar opportunities to understand the complex interplay of nutrition, physical activity, and weight will inform better health outcomes.Going forward, holistic research approaches, encompassing insights from multiple disciplines and perspectives, will catalyze progress urgently needed to prevent cancer and improve public health.",,,3,,,
2046,"Comparison of dynamic monitoring strategies based on CD4 cell counts in virally suppressed, HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy in high-income countries: a prospective, observational study BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines vary with respect to the optimal monitoring frequency of HIV-positive individuals. We compared dynamic monitoring strategies based on time-varying CD4 cell counts in virologically suppressed HIV-positive individuals. METHODS: In this observational study, we used data from prospective studies of HIV-positive individuals in Europe (France, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) and North and South America (Brazil, Canada, and the USA) in The HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration and The Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems. We compared three monitoring strategies that differ in the threshold used to measure CD4 cell count and HIV RNA viral load every 3-6 months (when below the threshold) or every 9-12 months (when above the threshold). The strategies were defined by the threshold CD4 counts of 200 cells per _L, 350 cells per _L, and 500 cells per _L. Using inverse probability weighting to adjust for baseline and time-varying confounders, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of death and of AIDS-defining illness or death, risk ratios of virological failure, and mean differences in CD4 cell count. FINDINGS: 47_635 individuals initiated an antiretroviral therapy regimen between Jan 1, 2000, and Jan 9, 2015, and met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in our study. During follow-up, CD4 cell count was measured on average every 4_0 months and viral load every 3_8 months. 464 individuals died (107 in threshold 200 strategy, 157 in threshold 350, and 200 in threshold 500) and 1091 had AIDS-defining illnesses or died (267 in threshold 200 strategy, 365 in threshold 350, and 459 in threshold 500). Compared with threshold 500, the mortality HR was 1_05 (95% CI 0_86-1_29) for threshold 200 and 1_02 (0_91_1_14) for threshold 350. Corresponding estimates for death or AIDS-defining illness were 1_08 (0_95-1_22) for threshold 200 and 1_03 (0_96-1_12) for threshold 350. Compared with threshold 500, the 24 month risk ratios of virological failure (viral load more than 200 copies per mL) were 2_01 (1_17-3_43) for threshold 200 and 1_24 (0_89-1_73) for threshold 350, and 24 month mean CD4 cell count differences were 0_4 (-25_5 to 26_3) cells per _L for threshold 200 and -3_5 (-16_0 to 8_9) cells per _L for threshold 350. INTERPRETATION: Decreasing monitoring to annually when CD4 count is higher than 200 cells per _L compared with higher than 500 cells per _L does not worsen the short-term clinical and immunological outcomes of virally suppressed HIV-positive individuals. However, more frequent virological monitoring might be necessary to reduce the risk of virological failure. Further follow-up studies are needed to establish the long-term safety of these strategies.

2047,"When to Monitor CD4 Cell Count and HIV RNA to Reduce Mortality and AIDS-Defining Illness in Virologically Suppressed HIV-Positive Persons on Antiretroviral Therapy in High-Income Countries: A Prospective Observational Study OBJECTIVE: To illustrate an approach to compare CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA monitoring strategies in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). DESIGN: Prospective studies of HIV-positive individuals in Europe and the USA in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration and The Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems. METHODS: Antiretroviral-naive individuals who initiated ART and became virologically suppressed within 12 months were followed from the date of suppression. We compared 3 CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA monitoring strategies: once every (1) 3 _ 1 months, (2) 6 _ 1 months, and (3) 9-12 _ 1 months. We used inverse-probability weighted models to compare these strategies with respect to clinical, immunologic, and virologic outcomes. RESULTS: In 39,029 eligible individuals, there were 265 deaths and 690 AIDS-defining illnesses or deaths. Compared with the 3-month strategy, the mortality hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 0.86 (0.42 to 1.78) for the 6 months and 0.82 (0.46 to 1.47) for the 9-12 month strategy. The respective 18-month risk ratios (95% CIs) of virologic failure (RNA >200) were 0.74 (0.46 to 1.19) and 2.35 (1.56 to 3.54) and 18-month mean CD4 differences (95% CIs) were -5.3 (-18.6 to 7.9) and -31.7 (-52.0 to -11.3). The estimates for the 2-year risk of AIDS-defining illness or death were similar across strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that monitoring frequency of virologically suppressed individuals can be decreased from every 3 months to every 6, 9, or 12 months with respect to clinical outcomes. Because effects of different monitoring strategies could take years to materialize, longer follow-up is needed to fully evaluate this question.",,,5,,,
2048,"Open Chromatin Profiling in Adipose Tissue Marks Genomic Regions with Functional Roles in Cardiometabolic Traits Identifying the regulatory mechanisms of genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci affecting adipose tissue has been restricted due to limited characterization of adipose transcriptional regulatory elements. We profiled chromatin accessibility in three frozen human subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsies and preadipocytes and adipocytes from the Simpson Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) cell strain using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We identified 68,571 representative accessible chromatin regions (peaks) across adipose tissue samples (FDR < 5%). GWAS loci for eight cardiometabolic traits were enriched in these peaks (P < 0.005), with the strongest enrichment for waist-hip ratio. Of 110 recently described cardiometabolic GWAS loci colocalized with adipose tissue eQTLs, 59 loci had one or more variants overlapping an adipose tissue peak. Annotated variants at the SNX10 waist-hip ratio locus and the ATP2A1-SH2B1 body mass index locus showed allelic differences in regulatory assays. These adipose tissue accessible chromatin regions elucidate genetic variants that may alter adipose tissue function to impact cardiometabolic traits. Copyright _ 2019 Cannon et al.",,,8,,,
2049,"Benchmarking life expectancy and cancer mortality: global comparison with cardiovascular disease 1981-2010 Objective_To quantify the impact of cancer (all cancers combined and major sites) compared with cardiovascular disease (CVD) on longevity worldwide during 1981-2010.Design_Retrospective demographic analysis using aggregated data.Setting_National civil registration systems in member states of the World Health Organization.Participants_52 populations with moderate to high quality data on cause specific mortality.Main outcome measures_Disease specific contributions to changes in life expectancy in ages 40-84 (LE40-84) over time in populations grouped by two levels of Human Development Index (HDI) values.Results_Declining CVD mortality rates during 1981-2010 contributed to, on average, over half of the gains in LE40-84; the corresponding gains were 2.3 (men) and 1.7 (women) years, and 0.5 (men) and 0.8 (women) years in very high and medium and high HDI populations, respectively. Declines in cancer mortality rates contributed to, on average, 20% of the gains in LE40-84, or 0.8 (men) and 0.5 (women) years in very high HDI populations, and to over 10% or 0.2 years (both sexes) in medium and high HDI populations. Declining lung cancer mortality rates brought about the largest LE40-84 gain in men in very high HDI populations (up to 0.7 years in the Netherlands), whereas in medium and high HDI populations its contribution was smaller yet still positive. Among women, declines in breast cancer mortality rates were largely responsible for the improvement in longevity, particularly among very high HDI populations (up to 0.3 years in the United Kingdom). In contrast, losses in LE40-84 were observed in many medium and high HDI populations as a result of increasing breast cancer mortality rates.Conclusions_The control of CVD has led to substantial gains in LE40-84 worldwide. The inequality in improvement in longevity attributed to declining cancer mortality rates reflects inequities in implementation of cancer control, particularly in less resourced populations and in women. Global actions are needed to revitalize efforts for cancer control, with a specific focus on less resourced countries. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

2050,"Social Media Interventions to Promote HIV Testing, Linkage, Adherence, and Retention: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis BACKGROUND: Social media is increasingly used to deliver HIV interventions for key populations worldwide. However, little is known about the specific uses and effects of social media on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interventions. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review examines the effectiveness of social media interventions to promote HIV testing, linkage, adherence, and retention among key populations. METHODS: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist and Cochrane guidelines for this review and registered it on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO. We systematically searched six databases and three conference websites using search terms related to HIV, social media, and key populations. We included studies where (1) the intervention was created or implemented on social media platforms, (2) study population included men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender individuals, people who inject drugs (PWID), and/or sex workers, and (3) outcomes included promoting HIV testing, linkage, adherence, and/or retention. Meta-analyses were conducted by Review Manager, version 5.3. Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by random-effects models. RESULTS: Among 981 manuscripts identified, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found 18 studies from high-income countries, 8 in middle-income countries, and 0 in low-income countries. Eight were randomized controlled trials, and 18 were observational studies. All studies (n=26) included MSM; five studies also included transgender individuals. The focus of 21 studies was HIV testing, four on HIV testing and linkage to care, and one on antiretroviral therapy adherence. Social media interventions were used to do the following: build online interactive communities to encourage HIV testing/adherence (10 studies), provide HIV testing services (9 studies), disseminate HIV information (9 studies), and develop intervention materials (1 study). Of the studies providing HIV self-testing, 16% of participants requested HIV testing kits from social media platforms. Existing social media platforms such as Facebook (n=15) and the gay dating app Grindr (n=10) were used most frequently. Data from four studies show that HIV testing uptake increased after social media interventions (n=1283, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.28-1.76). In the studies where social media interventions were participatory, HIV testing uptake was higher in the intervention arm than the comparison arm (n=1023, RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.19-2.26). CONCLUSIONS: Social media interventions are effective in promoting HIV testing among MSM in many settings. Social media interventions to improve HIV services beyond HIV testing in low- and middle-income countries and among other key populations need to be considered.

2051,"Genetic and environmental aspects in the association between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms and binge-eating behavior in adults: a twin study BACKGROUND: Prior research demonstrated that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with binge-eating behavior, binge-eating disorder (BED), and bulimia nervosa (BN). The aim of this study was to investigate these associations in an adult twin population, and to determine the extent to which ADHD symptoms and binge-eating behavior share genetic and environmental factors. METHODS: We used self-reports of current ADHD symptoms and lifetime binge-eating behavior and associated characteristics from a sample of over 18 000 adult twins aged 20-46 years, from the population-based Swedish Twin Registry. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between ADHD and lifetime binge-eating behavior, BED, and BN. Structural equation modeling was used in 13 773 female twins to determine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the association between ADHD symptoms and binge-eating behavior in female adult twins. RESULTS: ADHD symptoms were significantly associated with lifetime binge-eating behavior, BED, and BN. The heritability estimate for current ADHD symptoms was 0.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.44], and for lifetime binge-eating behavior 0.65 (95% CI 0.54-0.74). The genetic correlation was estimated as 0.35 (95% CI 0.25-0.46) and the covariance between ADHD and binge-eating behavior was primarily explained by genetic factors (91%). Non-shared environmental factors explained the remaining part of the covariance. CONCLUSIONS: The association between adult ADHD symptoms and binge-eating behavior in females is largely explained by shared genetic risk factors.",,,1,,,
2052,"Envelope protein glycosylation mediates zika virus pathogenesis Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus. Recent ZIKV outbreaks have produced serious human disease, including neurodevelopmental malformations (congenital Zika syndrome) and Guillain-Barr_ syndrome. These outcomes were not associated with ZIKV infection prior to 2013, raising the possibility that viral genetic changes could contribute to new clinical manifestations. All contemporary ZIKV isolates encode an N-linked glycosylation site in the envelope (E) protein (N154), but this glycosylation site is absent in many historical ZIKV isolates. Here, we investigated the role of E protein glycosylation in ZIKV pathogenesis using two contemporary Asian-lineage strains (H/PF/2013 and PRVABC59) and the historical African-lineage strain (MR766). We found that glycosylated viruses were highly pathogenic in Ifnar1-/- mice. In contrast, nonglycosylated viruses were attenuated, producing lower viral loads in the serum and brain when inoculated subcutaneously but remaining neurovirulent when inoculated intracranially. These results suggest that E glycosylation is advantageous in the periphery but not within the brain. Accordingly, we found that glycosylation facilitated infection of cells expressing the lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) or DC-SIGN-related (DC-SIGNR), suggesting that inefficient infection of lectin-expressing leukocytes could contribute to the attenuation of nonglycosylated ZIKV in mice.IMPORTANCE It is unclear why the ability of Zika virus (ZIKV) to cause serious disease, including Guillain-Barr_ syndrome and birth defects, was not recognized until recent outbreaks. One contributing factor could be genetic differences between contemporary ZIKV strains and historical ZIKV strains. All isolates from recent outbreaks encode a viral envelope protein that is glycosylated, whereas many historical ZIKV strains lack this glycosylation. We generated nonglycosylated ZIKV mutants from contemporary and historical strains and evaluated their virulence in mice. We found that nonglycosylated viruses were attenuated and produced lower viral loads in serum and brains. Our studies suggest that envelope protein glycosylation contributes to ZIKV pathogenesis, possibly by facilitating attachment to and infection of lectin-expressing leukocytes.

2053,"Influence of race on microsatellite instability and CD8+ T cell infiltration in colon cancer African American patients with colorectal cancer show higher mortality than their Caucasian counterparts. Biology might play a partial role, and prior studies suggest a higher prevalence for microsatellite instability (MSI) among cancers from African Americans, albeit patients with MSI cancers have improved survival over patients with non-MSI cancers, counter to the outcome observed for African American patients. CD8+ T cell infiltration of colon cancer is postively correlated with MSI tumors, and is also related to improved outcome. Here, we utilized a 503-person, population-based colon cancer cohort comprising 45% African Americans to determine, under blinded conditions from all epidemiological data, the prevalence of MSI and associated CD8+ T cell infiltration within the cancers. Among Caucasian cancers, 14% were MSI, whereas African American cancers demonstrated 7% MSI (P_=_0.009). Clinically, MSI cancers between races were similar; among microsatellite stable cancers, African American patients were younger, female, and with proximal cancers. CD8+ T cells were higher in MSI cancers (88.0 vs 30.4/hpf, P< 0.0001), but was not different between races. Utilizing this population-based cohort, African American cancers show half the MSI prevalence of Caucasians without change in CD8+ T cell infiltration which may contribute towards their higher mortality from colon cancer.",,,3,,,

Use of these services often is substantially lower among racial and ethnic minority groups, rural residents, and persons of lower socioeconomic status. On 19 and 20 June 2019, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened the Pathways to Prevention Workshop: Achieving Health Equity in Preventive Services to assess the available evidence on disparities in the use of 10 USPSTF-recommended clinical preventive services for cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. The workshop was cosponsored by the NIH Office of Disease Prevention; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities; National Cancer Institute; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. A multidisciplinary working group developed the agenda, and an Evidence-based Practice Center prepared the evidence report. During the workshop, invited experts considered the evidence, with discussion among attendees. After weighing evidence from the review, presentations, and public comments, an independent panel prepared a draft report that was posted for public comment. This final report summarizes the panel's findings, identifying current gaps in knowledge. The panel made 26 recommendations for new research and methods development to improve implementation of proven services to reduce disparities in preventable conditions.",,,4,,,
2056,"Future research needs for evaluating the integration of mental health and substance abuse treatment with primary care Research needs are many in the current health care environment. In this article, we describe a novel method developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center Program for prioritizing areas for future research. Using a recent- ly published systematic review as a foundation, investigators worked with a diverse group of 10 stakeholders to identify and prioritize research needs. We enumerate 13 high-priority research needs, as determined by stakeholders who represented researchers, funders, health care providers, and patients and families, and discuss considerations for specific study designs. Our findings suggest that future research on integrating mental health and primary care should focus first on a) identifying methods of integrating primary care into specialty mental health settings, b) identifying cross-cutting strategies for integration across multiple mental health diagnostic categories as opposed to a separate strategy for each diagnostic category, and c) examining the use of information technology for integrating mental and general medical health care. Other priorities for consideration include examining the economic and organizational sus- tainability of successful integration models, identifying dissemination methods for various settings, examining the business case for integration as well as methods of payment, assessing the cost-effectiveness of integration, and identifying key components of successful strategies. The importance of sustainability and economic justification for integrated care strategies was a recurring theme in discussions with the stake- holders. The ability to sustain integrated care in everyday practice remains to be proved and will depend in part on the level of incentives and sup- port provided through payment system reform, as well as the ability of practices to provide care efficiently.",,,5,,,

2058,"Race, care seeking, and utilization for chronic back and neck pain: population perspectives UNLABELLED: We analyzed a statewide survey of individuals with chronic back and neck pain to determine whether prevalence and care use varied by patient race or ethnicity. We conducted a telephone survey of a random sample of 5,357 North Carolina households in 2006. Adults with chronic (>3 months duration or >24 episodes of pain per year), impairing back or neck pain were identified and were asked to complete a survey about their health and care utilization. 837 respondents (620 white, 183 black, 34 Latino) reported chronic back or neck pain. Whites and blacks had similar rates of chronic back pain. Back pain prevalence was lower in Latinos (10.4% [9.3-11.6] vs 6.3% [3.8-8.8]), likely due to their younger age; and the prevalence of chronic, disabling neck pain was lower in blacks (2.5% [1.9-3.1] vs 1.1% [.04-1.9]). Blacks had higher pain scores in the previous 3 months (5.2 vs 5.9 P < .05), and higher Roland disability scores (0-23 point scale): 14.2 vs 16.8, P < .05. Care seeking was similar among races (83% white, 85% black, 72% Latino). Use of opioids was also similar between races, at 49% for whites, 52% for blacks, and trended lower at 35% for Latinos. We found few racial/ethnic differences in care seeking, treatment use, and use of narcotics for the treatment of chronic back and neck pain. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents new, population-based data on the issue of racial and ethnic disparities in neck- and back-pain prevalence and care. Few disparities were found; care quality issues may affect all ethnic groups similarly. Previous findings of disparities in chronic-pain management may be decreasing, or may perhaps be site specific.

2059,"Practice-based Research Networks (PBRNs) in the Era of Integrated Delivery Systems Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) have been in existence for several decades, and they provide one mechanism to conduct research outside of academic research centers. Two transformative changes to the practice environment pose significant challenges to the manner in which PBRNs have functioned in the past and require changes to their current activities. The widespread introduction of electronic health records and the organization of practices into often hospital-dominated integrated delivery systems change the manner in which medicine is practiced, administered, and financed. Research funders are committed to extending research into communities, although we have yet to learn how to conduct these activities efficiently. We describe a number of operational challenges to this transformation, and we also propose ways to address these challenges and improve the quality and efficiency through which research is conducted.

2060,"Generalization and dilution of association results from European GWAS in populations of non-European ancestry: the PAGE study The vast majority of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings reported to date are from populations with European Ancestry (EA), and it is not yet clear how broadly the genetic associations described will generalize to populations of diverse ancestry. The Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study is a consortium of multi-ancestry, population-based studies formed with the objective of refining our understanding of the genetic architecture of common traits emerging from GWAS. In the present analysis of five common diseases and traits, including body mass index, type 2 diabetes, and lipid levels, we compare direction and magnitude of effects for GWAS-identified variants in multiple non-EA populations against EA findings. We demonstrate that, in all populations analyzed, a significant majority of GWAS-identified variants have allelic associations in the same direction as in EA, with none showing a statistically significant effect in the opposite direction, after adjustment for multiple testing. However, 25% of tagSNPs identified in EA GWAS have significantly different effect sizes in at least one non-EA population, and these differential effects were most frequent in African Americans where all differential effects were diluted toward the null. We demonstrate that differential LD between tagSNPs and functional variants within populations contributes significantly to dilute effect sizes in this population. Although most variants identified from GWAS in EA populations generalize to all non-EA populations assessed, genetic models derived from GWAS findings in EA may generate spurious results in non-EA populations due to differential effect sizes. Regardless of the origin of the differential effects, caution should be exercised in applying any genetic risk prediction model based on tagSNPs outside of the ancestry group in which it was derived. Models based directly on functional variation may generalize more robustly, but the identification of functional variants remains challenging.",,,8,,,

2063,"Chile's 2014 sugar-sweetened beverage tax and changes in prices and purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages: An observational study in an urban environment BACKGROUND: On October 1, 2014, the Chilean government modified its previous sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax, increasing the tax rate from 13% to 18% on industrialized beverages with high levels of sugar (H-SSBs) (greater than 6.25 grams [g] sugar/100 milliliters [mL]) and decreasing the tax rate from 13% to 10% on industrialized beverages with low or no sugar (L-SSBs) (less than 6.25 g sugar/100 mL). This study examines changes in beverage prices and household beverage purchases following the implementation of the tax reform. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used longitudinal data collected between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, from 2,000 households. We defined the pretax period as January 1, 2013, to September 30, 2014, and the posttax period as October 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. We conducted a pre-post analysis for changes in prices and purchases, with the latter examined by volume and calories. We compared posttax changes in prices and purchases to a counterfactual, defined as what would have been expected in the posttax period based on pretax trends. All results are stated as comparisons to this counterfactual. We linked beverages at the bar code level to nutrition facts panel data collected by a team of Chilean nutritionists who categorized them by taxation level and beverage subcategory, which included carbonated and noncarbonated H-SSBs and concentrated, ready-to-drink L-SSBs and untaxed beverages. We reconstituted concentrated beverages and analyzed all beverages using as-consumed volumes and calories. Posttax monthly prices of H-SSBs increased, but these changes were small. Prices of carbonated H-SSBs increased by 2.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0%-3.0%), while those of noncarbonated H-SSBs increased by 3.9% (95% CI 1.6%-6.2%). Prices of L-SSB concentrates decreased after the tax by 6.7% (95% CI -8.2%--4.6%), and prices of ready-to-drink L-SSBs increased by 1.5% (95% CI 0.3%-2.7%). Households decreased monthly per capita purchases of H-SSBs by 3.4% by volume (95% CI -5.9%--0.9%) and 4.0% by calories (95% CI -6.3%--1.9%), and this change was greater among high socioeconomic status (SES) households. The volume of household purchases of L-SSBs increased 10.7% (95% CI 7.5%-13.9%), while that of untaxed beverage purchases decreased by 3.1% (95% CI -5.1%--1.1%). The main limitation of this study was that there was no control group, so we were unable to assess the causal impact of the tax. CONCLUSIONS: The modifications of Chile's SSB tax were small, and observed changes in prices and purchases of beverages after the tax were also small. Our results are consistent with previous evidence indicating that small increases in SSB taxes are unlikely to promote large enough changes in SSB purchases to reduce obesity and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).",,,5,,,
2064,"Sugary drinks taxation, projected consumption and fiscal revenues in Colombia: Evidence from a QUAIDS model The global shift towards diets high in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is linked to higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and most other non-communicable diseases. In Colombia, one out of every two people was overweight or obese by 2010. This study estimates price-elasticities from a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model, using the 2006-2007 Colombian Income and Expenditure survey. The food groups that were jointly considered were: unsweetened unflavored milks; coffee and tea; sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs); sweets and candies (including sugar); dairy products; meats and animal-based products; grains based staples; fruits and vegetables; and condiments and snacks. We take into account the high proportion of households not purchasing specific food and beverage groups (censored data) and endogeneity on both prices (as unit values) and total expenditure. Unhealthy beverages are price-elastic (-1.61 for SSBs) meaning that the change in consumption is proportionally larger with respect to a change in price. Also, there is a high complementarity among SSBs and major food groups (grains, meats and fruits and vegetables). In Colombia, the design of a meaningful tax to influence healthier diets is a next critical step. This study also shows that a tax of 20% on SSBs should prove to be effective, and can yield revenues of about 1% of the Colombian government's total annual fiscal revenue, which can potentially be directed towards public health promotion and investments.",,,4,,,
2065,"Designing a food tax to impact food-related non-communicable diseases: the case of Chile The global shift towards diets high in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and energy dense ultra-processed foods is linked to higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and most other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), causing significant health costs. Chile has the highest SSB consumption in the world, very high junk food intake and very rapid increases in these poor components of the diet plus obesity prevalence. This study's purpose is to compare the effect of different tax schemes for SSBs and ultra-processed foods on nutrient availability, utilizing price-elasticities, which are estimated from a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model, using the 2011-2012 Income and Expenditure survey. We take into account the high proportion of households not purchasing various food and beverage groups (censored nature of data). The food groups considered were: sweets and desserts; salty snacks and chips; meat products and fats; fruits, vegetables and seafood; cereals and cereal products; SSB ready-to-drink; SSB from concentrate; plain water, coffee and tea; and milk, which together represent 90% of food expenditures. The simulated taxes were: (1) 40% price tax on SSBs(22% above the current tax level); (2) a 5 cents per gram of sugar tax on products with added sugar; and (3) 30% price tax on all foods(27% above current tax levels) and beverages (12% above the current tax level) exceeding thresholds on sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar and for which marketing is restricted (based on a Chilean law, effective June 16 2016). Unhealthy foods are price-elastic (-1.99 for salty snacks and chips, -1.06 for SSBs ready-to-drink, and -1.27 for SSBs from concentrate), meaning that the change in consumption is proportionally larger with respect to a change in price. Results are robust to different model specification, and consistent among different socioeconomic sub-populations. Overall, the tax on marketing controlled foods and beverages is associated with the largest reduction in household purchases of sodium, added sugar, saturated fat and calorie purchases. Chile is unique in currently having instituted a small current SSB tax as well as marketing controls and front-of-package labeling of unhealthy foods and beverages. The design of a larger, more comprehensive tax to enhance the overall effect of these policies on healthier diets is a next critical step. This study shows that a large tax on the same foods and beverages already delineated as unhealthy by the marketing controls and front-of-pack labeling should prove to be more effective for promoting a healthier diet.",,,4,,,
2066,"Combined fiscal policies to promote healthier diets: Effects on purchases and consumer welfare Taxes on unhealthy foods and sweetened beverages, as well as subsidies to healthy foods, have become increasingly popular strategies to curb obesity and related non-communicable diseases. The existing evidence on the welfare effects of such fiscal policies is mixed and almost uniquely focused on tax schemes. Using the 2016-2017 Chilean Household Budget Survey, we estimate a censored Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) incomplete demand system and simulate changes in purchases, tax incidence, and consumer welfare of three different policy scenarios: (1) a 5 percentage point additional tax on sweetened beverages (currently taxed at 18%) and a new 18% tax on sweets and snacks, (2) a healthy subsidy by zero-rating fruits and vegetables from the current 19% value-added tax, and (3) a combined (tax plus subsidy) policy. Under full pass-through of these policies, the combined scheme captures the incentives to switch purchases from both single-policy alternatives, resulting in a net welfare gain and subsidy transfer for the average Chilean household. In terms of welfare, low-income households strictly benefit from a combined policy, while high-income households experience a small consumer welfare loss, resulting in re-distributional effects.",,,5,,,
2067,"The relationship between patient-provider communication and quality of life for children with asthma and their caregivers OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether patient-provider communication is associated with asthma-related quality of life (QOL) and asthma outcomes among children with asthma and their caregivers. METHODS: Children ages 8-16 years with asthma and their caregivers (n_=_296) were recruited at five pediatric practices in North Carolina. Children and caregivers reported demographic and clinical characteristics immediately after an audio-taped medical visit with their health care provider. During a home visit that took place 1 month after the medical visit, children and caregivers reported asthma-related QOL, and caregivers reported child asthma outcomes, including asthma symptom days and missed school days. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine whether patient-provider communication during the medical visit was associated with child and caregiver QOL and child asthma outcomes 1 month later. RESULTS: On average, providers asked caregivers 4.5 questions and asked children 3 questions per visit, whereas caregivers and children asked less than 1 question per visit. Providers asked children more asthma-related questions, caregivers reported better QOL and fewer asthma symptom days 1 month later. Children and caregivers with higher asthma-management self-efficacy at the office visit reported better QOL 1 month later. CONCLUSIONS: Mirroring national guideline recommendations, our results suggest that providers should ask children about their asthma during medical visits. Future longitudinal studies should conduct mediation analyses to determine whether asking children asthma-related questions during medical visits increases children's asthma management self-efficacy and ultimately improve outcomes, such as QOL, health care utilization, symptom days and missed school days.",,,2,,,
2068,"The effect of conflicting medication information and physician support on medication adherence for chronically ill patients OBJECTIVE: This article explores the effect of conflicting information, defined as contradictory information about medication topics from different sources, on medication adherence in a sample of chronically ill patients. We specifically investigate whether conflicting information and physician support directly affect medication adherence or whether the effect is mediated by adherence self-efficacy and outcome expectations for medications. METHODS: Vasculitis patients (n = 228) completed two on-line questionnaires which contained measures of conflicting information, adherence self-efficacy, outcome expectations, physician support, and medication adherence. We conducted a mediation analysis using a bootstrapping approach to generate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals to test the significance of each mediated effect. RESULTS: A majority of patients (51.3%) received conflicting medication information. Conflicting information had a direct negative effect on medication adherence, which was not mediated by self-efficacy or outcome expectations. Alternatively, self-efficacy mediated the positive effect of physician support on medication adherence. CONCLUSION: Patients who encounter conflicting medication information are less adherent to their medications. The presence of a supportive physician may counteract the negative effect of conflicting medication information. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Physicians should initiate conversations about conflicting medication information with their patients. Consensus-based guidelines that address medication discrepancies may also reduce the availability of conflicting information. Copyright _ 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,0,,,
2069,"Use and perceived credibility of medication information sources for patients with a rare illness: differences by gender Patients with rare illnesses may use medication information sources that are appreciably different from those used by patients with more common illnesses. This article's purpose is to describe vasculitis patients' most frequently used medication information sources, determine which sources patients perceive as credible, and explore gender differences in source use and perceived credibility. Using an online questionnaire, patients (n_=_232) indicated how often they obtained medication information from 12 sources during the previous year and rated the credibility of 6 sources. The authors used multivariate analysis of covariance and follow-up contrasts to test for gender differences in source use and conducted t tests to compare patients' perceived credibility ratings. Patients used physicians and the Internet most often to obtain medication information and rated them as the most credible sources. Male patients used their spouse/partner more often and rated them as more credible than did female patients. Female patients were more likely to use medication package inserts and the Internet and were less likely to use nurses than were male patients. There appear to be similarities and differences between the information-seeking behaviors of vasculitis patients and other patient populations. Because male patients view their spouse/partner as a credible information source, providers may want to involve the spouse/partner in prescription decision making.",,,5,,,
2070,"Conflicting medication information: prevalence, sources, and relationship to medication adherence Conflicting medication information has been defined as contradictory information about a medication topic from two or more sources. The objective of this study was to determine whether arthritis patients are exposed to conflicting medication information, to document sources of conflicting information, and to explore whether conflicting information is associated with sociodemographic factors, clinical characteristics, and medication adherence. Using an online survey, arthritis patients (N_=_328) reported how often they received conflicting information about 12 medication topics as well as sources of conflicting information, demographic/clinical characteristics, and medication adherence. A linear regression model, which controlled for various demographic/clinical factors, determined whether conflicting information was associated with medication adherence. The majority of patients (80.1%) received conflicting information and were most likely to receive conflicting information about medication risks. Physicians, media sources, and the Internet were the most common sources of conflicting information. Less conflicting information (B_=-0.13, p_<_.05), more information source use (B_=_0.22, p_<_.01), and lower perceived regimen complexity (B_=-0.17, p_<_.05) were associated with better medication adherence. In conclusion, conflicting medication information is pervasive, comes from a variety of sources, and may negatively affect patient health outcomes. To potentially decrease exposure to conflicting information, providers should direct patients to high-quality medication information sources.",,,6,,,
2071,"The relationship between partner information-seeking, information-sharing, and patient medication adherence OBJECTIVES: We describe the medication information-seeking behaviors of arthritis patients' partners and explore whether partner medication information-seeking and information-sharing are associated with patient medication adherence. METHODS: Arthritis patients and their partners (n = 87 dyads) completed an on-line questionnaire. Partners indicated how often they obtained medication information from 14 sources, how much they trusted these sources, and whether they shared medication information with the patient. Patients reported their medication adherence. Bivariate associations were calculated to explore the relationships between partner information-seeking, information-sharing, and patient medication adherence. RESULTS: Partners sought little information about the patient's medications. Partners sought more information if the patient's medication regimen was more complex (r = 0.33, p = 0.002). Most partners (_ 98%) shared medication information with the patient; older partners shared more information with the patient (r = 0.25, p = 0.03). Neither partner information-seeking (r = 0.21, p = 0.06) nor partner information-sharing (r = 0.12, p = 0.31) were significantly associated with patient medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Although partners of arthritis patients do not seek large amounts of medication information, the vast majority share this information with the patient. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Involving partners in medical consultations can help them better understand the patient's medications, have questions answered by providers, and engage in more informed discussions with patients about their medications.

2072,"Shortcomings in public and private insurance coverage of diabetes self-management education and support The objective of this study is to present preliminary data to characterize public and private insurance coverage for diabetes self-management education (DSM Education) and diabetes self-management support (DSM Support). Representatives from Medicaid and 2 private insurance providers in 10 states provided coverage information for their insurance plans. Two states (the most populous state from the East and West coasts) were sampled purposively and 8 additional states from 4 geographic regions (northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest) were sampled at random. Representatives from each private insurer described both a premium and basic coverage plan. Thus, 10 Medicaid programs and 40 private insurance plans were represented. Information about Medicare coverage was accessed from publicly available documents. Restricted by physician certification of patient eligibility, Medicare coverage included 10 hours of DSM Education plus 3 hours of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) within a continuous 12-month period, and 4 hours of follow-up (2 hours DSM Education and 2 hours MNT) for each subsequent year. Only 22 of 40 sampled private insurance and 5 of 10 Medicaid plans covered DSM Education, which ranged from 7 to 20 hours of education per year. Medicaid and private plans often limited the amount of DSM Education or required patients to obtain a physician certification of eligibility. Other than on-demand access features, coverage of DSM Support was minimal. Public and private insurance coverage of DSM Education was neither widespread nor uniform, while coverage of DSM Support was scarce.",,,4,,,
2073,"Predictors of medication non-adherence for vasculitis patients The primary purpose of this article is to document whether demographic, clinical, regimen-related, intrapersonal, and interpersonal factors predict medication non-adherence for vasculitis patients. A secondary purpose is to explore whether adherence varies by medication type and whether patients experienced drug-related side effects. Vasculitis patients (n = 228) completed online baseline and 3-month follow-up surveys. Demographic (age, gender, education, race, marital status, and insurance status), clinical (perceived vasculitis severity, disease duration, vasculitis type, and relapse/remission status), regimen-related (experience of side effects), intrapersonal (depressive symptoms), and interpersonal (adherence-related support from family and friends) factors were measured at baseline. Medication non-adherence was assessed at follow-up using the Vasculitis Self-Management Survey medication adherence subscale (_ = 0.89). Variables that significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with non-adherence were included in a linear regression model to predict non-adherence. Younger age (r = -0.23, p < 0.001), female sex (r = 0.16, p < 0.05), experience of side effects (r = 0.15, p < 0.05), and more depressive symptoms (r = 0.22, p < 0.001) were associated with more medication non-adherence. In the regression model, younger age (_ = -0.01, p = 0.01) and more depressive symptoms (_ = 0.01 p = 0.02) predicted worse adherence. For six out of eight vasculitis medication types, patients who experienced side effects were less adherent than patients who did not experience side effects. Multiple factors are associated with medication non-adherence for vasculitis patients. Providers should discuss medication adherence and drug-related side effects with vasculitis patients. Providers may want to particularly target younger patients and patients with clinical signs of depression.",,,4,,,
2074,"The effect of medication-related support on the quality of life of patients with vasculitis in relapse and remission OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated whether the utility of social support for patients with a relapsing, remitting illness varies by activity level of the disease. Our goal was to determine whether disease status (relapse vs remission) moderates the effect of medication-related support from physicians and partners on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with vasculitis. METHODS: Patients with vasculitis (n = 228) completed baseline measures of disease status and medication-related support and a 3-month followup measure of HRQOL (RAND 36-item health survey 1.0). We calculated 8 HRQOL dimensions: physical functioning, physical role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role limitations, and mental health. Bonferroni-corrected t tests compared the HRQOL of patients in relapse to patients in remission, and multivariate analysis of covariance determined whether disease status moderated the effect of medication-related support from physicians and partners on patient HRQOL. Wilks' lambda assessed whether the support-by-disease status interaction terms were significant. RESULTS: Relapsing patients reported significantly worse quality of life compared with nonrelapsing patients for every HRQOL dimension except physical role limitations. Disease status did not moderate the effect of physician (lambda = 0.48; p = 0.86) or partner (lambda = 1.51; p = 0.16) medication-related support on HRQOL, although greater physician and partner support predicted better HRQOL for all dimensions except bodily pain and vitality. CONCLUSION: Vasculitis patients experience compromised HRQOL but the magnitude of the compromise is greater for patients experiencing a relapse. Medication-related support from physicians and partners is beneficial for patients' HRQOL regardless of disease status.",,,2,,,
2075,"Racial/Ethnic differences in quality of life for people living with arthritis who see a primary care physician OBJECTIVE: Previous research suggests that insufficient access to health care may contribute to health disparities in arthritis-related outcomes. The purpose of this article is to document whether racial disparities in health status, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and activity limitations exist for individuals living with arthritis who have access to a primary care physician. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey data were collected in 2005 and 2008 from individuals seeking care at 11 family practice clinics in North Carolina. Participants self-reported their arthritis status, health status, physical and mental HRQOL, and activity limitations. Analysis of variance was used to determine whether there were differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of White (n= 405), Black (n = 244), and Latino (n = 100) participants who self-reported arthritis. Linear regressions determined whether race/ethnicity was significantly associated with HRQOL and activity limitations; whereas, logistic regression determined whether the odds of poor health were higher for Black and Latino participants, controlling for age, gender, body mass index, marital status, and number of comorbid conditions. RESULTS: Over 50% of participants reported fair/poor health status and more than 8 days of poor physical and mental health and 6 days of activity limitations during the past month. Latino participants were more likely to report fair/poor health status and fewer activity limitations than Whites or Blacks, whereas Black participants reported fewer days of poor mental health. CONCLUSION: Despite access to a primary care physician, racial/ethnic disparities exist. Future research should explore the underlying reasons for the persistence of these disparities.",,,9,,,
2076,"An evaluation of physicians' engagement of children with asthma in treatment-related discussions Our objectives were to examine whether providers engage children with asthma in treatment-related discussions at the level children prefer (engagement concordance) and to determine whether engagement concordance is related to child, caregiver, and provider characteristics. Children with asthma (n_=_296) aged 8-16_years were recruited at five pediatric practices in North Carolina. Using audiotaped medical visit transcripts, we documented the number of treatment-related questions the providers asked the children. Children reported their preferred level of provider engagement. A logistic generalized estimating equation was used to determine which variables predicted engagement concordance. Most children (96.6%) wanted to be involved in treatment-related discussions. One-third of the providers did not ask children any treatment-related questions. Only 36.1% of provider-child dyads were concordant. Most discordant dyads were under-engaged (83.1%). Better engagement concordance was observed among older children (odds ratio (OR)_=_1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.07, 1.33)), male children (OR_=_1.67, 95% CI (1.03, 2.70)), and among providers with fewer years in practice (OR_=_.97, 95% CI (.94, .99)). Providers engaged in treatment-related discussions with younger children and females less frequently than these children preferred. Providers should ask children how much they want to be involved in treatment-related discussions and then attempt to engage children at the level they prefer. _ The Author(s) 2013.",,,3,,,
2077,"A framework for understanding cancer comparative effectiveness research data needs OBJECTIVES: Randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for evaluating cancer intervention efficacy. Randomized trials are not always feasible, practical, or timely and often don't adequately reflect patient heterogeneity and real-world clinical practice. Comparative effectiveness research can leverage secondary data to help fill knowledge gaps randomized trials leave unaddressed; however, comparative effectiveness research also faces shortcomings. The goal of this project was to develop a new model and inform an evolving framework articulating cancer comparative effectiveness research data needs. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We examined prevalent models and conducted semi-structured discussions with 76 clinicians and comparative effectiveness research researchers affiliated with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's cancer comparative effectiveness research programs. RESULTS: A new model was iteratively developed and presents cancer comparative effectiveness research and important measures in a patient-centered, longitudinal chronic care model better reflecting contemporary cancer care in the context of the cancer care continuum, rather than a single-episode, acute-care perspective. CONCLUSION: Immediately relevant for federally funded comparative effectiveness research programs, the model informs an evolving framework articulating cancer comparative effectiveness research data needs, including evolutionary enhancements to registries and epidemiologic research data systems. We discuss elements of contemporary clinical practice, methodology improvements, and related needs affecting comparative effectiveness research's ability to yield findings clinicians, policy makers, and stakeholders can confidently act on.

2078,"Translating research into practice: the role of provider-based research networks in the diffusion of an evidence-based colon cancer treatment innovation BACKGROUND: Provider-based research networks (PBRNs)--collaborative research partnerships between academic centers and community-based practitioners--are a promising model for accelerating the translation of research into practice; however, empirical evidence of accelerated translation is limited. Oxaliplatin in adjuvant combination chemotherapy is an innovation with clinical trial-proven survival benefit compared with prior therapies. The goal of this study is to examine the diffusion of oxaliplatin into community practice, and whether affiliation with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP)--a nationwide cancer-focused PBRN--is associated with accelerated innovation adoption. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational study used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and NCI CCOP data to examine Medicare participants with stage III colon cancer initiating treatment in 2003 through 2006, the years surrounding oxaliplatin's Food and Drug Administration approval. A fixed-effects analysis examined chemotherapy use among patients treated outside academic centers at CCOP-affiliated practices compared with non-CCOP practices. Two-group modeling controlled for multiple levels of clustering, year of chemotherapy initiation, tumor characteristics, patient age, race, comorbidity, Medicaid dual-eligibility status, and education. RESULTS: Of 4055 community patients, 35% received 5-fluoruracil, 20% received oxaliplatin, 7% received another chemotherapy, and 38% received no chemotherapy. Twenty-five percent of CCOP patients received oxaliplatin, compared with 19% of non-CCOP patients. In multivariable analysis, CCOP exposure was associated with higher odds of receiving guideline-concordant treatment in general, and oxaliplatin specifically. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to a growing set of evidence linking PBRNs with a greater probability of receiving treatment innovations and high-quality cancer care, with implications for clinical and research policy.",,,2,,,
2079,"Can attention to the intestinal microbiota improve understanding and treatment of anorexia nervosa? Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by severe dietary restriction or other weight loss behaviors and exhibits the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Therapeutic renourishment in AN is founded primarily on clinical opinion and guidelines, with a weak evidence base. Genetic factors do not fully account for the etiology of AN, and non-genetic factors that contribute to the onset and persistence of this disease warrant investigation. Compelling evidence that the intestinal microbiota regulates adiposity and metabolism, and more recently, anxiety behavior, provides a strong rationale for exploring the role of this complex microbial community in the onset, maintenance of, and recovery from AN. This review explores the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and AN and a potential role for this enteric microbial community as a therapy for this severe illness.",,,1,,,
2080,"Social cohesion, condom use, and sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers living with HIV in the Dominican Republic This cross-sectional study examines the relationship between social cohesion with consistent condom use (CCU) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among the Abriendo Puertas (Opening Doors) cohort of female sex workers (FSWs) living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the Dominican Republic (n_=_228). Using data from the follow-up survey of the cohort, we conducted multivariate logistic regression to explore these dynamics. Social cohesion was significantly associated with CCU between FSWs living with HIV and their clients in the last month (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]_=_1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-2.45) and STI prevalence among FSWs (AOR: 3.76, CI: 1.159-12.162). Social cohesion was not associated with CCU between FSWs living with HIV and their steady partners. However, both illicit drug use in the past six months (AOR_=_0.11, CI: 0.023-0.57) and pregnancy intentions (AOR_=_0.11; CI: 0.02-0.42) were significantly associated with CCU with steady partners. Findings highlight the differential role of social cohesion on condom use outcomes between FSWs living with HIV and their paying clients versus steady partners. Research on the pathways via which cohesion influences condom use among sex workers and their clients is merited, as is research regarding the role of drug use and pregnancy intentions on condom use with steady partners.",,,2,,,
2081,"Genetics: A new landscape for medical geography The emergence and re-emergence of human pathogens resistant to medical treatment will present a challenge to the international public health community in the coming decades. Geography is uniquely positioned to examine the progressive evolution of pathogens across space and through time, and to link molecular change to interactions between population and environmental drivers. Landscape as an organizing principle for the integration of natural and cultural forces has a long history in geography, and, more specifically, in medical geography. Here, we explore the role of landscape in medical geography, the emergent field of landscape genetics, and the great potential that exists in the combination of these two disciplines. We argue that landscape genetics can enhance medical geographic studies of local-level disease environments with quantitative tests of how human-environment interactions influence pathogenic characteristics. In turn, such analyses can expand theories of disease diffusion to the molecular scale and distinguish the important factors in ecologies of disease that drive genetic change of pathogens.",,,1,,,
2082,"Spatial epidemiology of recently acquired HIV infections across rural and urban areas of North Carolina Transmission of HIV continues in the United States (US), despite prevention efforts aimed at education and treatment. Concurrently, drug resistance in HIV, particularly in patients being infected with HIV for the first time, poses a threat to the continued success of treatment for HIV positive individuals. In North Carolina, nearly one in five individuals with acute HIV infection (AHI) is infected with a drug-resistant strain, a phenomenon known as transmitted drug resistance (TDR). Few studies of AHI or TDR take into account both the spatial aspects of residence at time of infection and the genetic characteristics of the viruses, and questions remain about how viruses are transmitted across space and the rural-urban divide. Using AHI strains from North Carolina, we examined whether differences exist in the spatial patterns of AHI versus AHI with TDR, as well as whether the genetic characteristics of these HIV infections vary by rural-urban status and across Health Service Areas. The highest amounts of TDR were detected in persons under age 30, African Americans, and men who have sex with men (MSM)--similar to the populations where the highest numbers of AHI without TDR are observed. Nearly a quarter of patients reside in rural areas, and there are no significant differences between rural and urban residence among individuals infected with drug resistant or drug susceptible viruses. We observe similar levels of genetic distance between HIV found in rural and urban areas, indicating that viruses are shared across the rural-urban divide. Genetic differences are observed, however, across Health Service Areas, suggesting that local areas are sites of genetic differentiation in viruses being transmitted to newly infected individuals. These results indicate that future efforts to prevent HIV transmission need to be spatially targeted, focusing on local-level transmission in risky populations, in addition to statewide anti- HIV efforts.",,,6,,,
2083,"Diarrheal disease risk in rural Bangladesh decreases as tubewell density increases: a zero-inflated and geographically weighted analysis BACKGROUND: This study investigates the impact of tubewell user density on cholera and shigellosis events in Matlab, Bangladesh between 2002 and 2004. Household-level demographic, health, and water infrastructure data were incorporated into a local geographic information systems (GIS) database. Geographically-weighted regression (GWR) models were constructed to identify spatial variation of relationships across the study area. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were run to simultaneously measure the likelihood of increased magnitude of disease events and the likelihood of zero cholera or shigellosis events. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tubewell density on both the occurrence of diarrheal disease and the magnitude of diarrheal disease incidence. RESULTS: In Matlab, households with greater tubewell density were more likely to report zero cholera or shigellosis events. Results for both cholera and shigellosis GWR models suggest that tubewell density effects are spatially stationary and the use of non-spatial statistical methods is appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the amount of drinking water available to households through increased density of tubewells contributed to lower reports of cholera and shigellosis events in rural Bangladesh. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tubewell installation and access to groundwater in reducing diarrheal disease events in the developing world.",,,1,,,
2084,"Changing spatial patterns and increasing rurality of HIV prevalence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2007 and 2013 The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has one of the lowest HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, estimated at 1.1% [0.9-1.3] of adults aged 15-49 in 2013 (UNAIDS). Within the 2 million km(2) country, however, there exists spatial variation in HIV prevalence, with the highest HIV prevalence observed in the large cities of Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. Globally, HIV is an increasingly rural disease, diffusing outwards from urban centers of high HIV prevalence to places where HIV was previously absent or present at very low levels. Utilizing data collected during Demographic and Health Surveillance (DHS) in 2007 and 2013 in the DRC, we sought to update the map of HIV prevalence in the DRC as well as to explore whether HIV in the DRC is an increasingly rural disease or remains confined to urban areas. Bayesian kriging and regression indicate that HIV prevalence in rural areas of the DRC is higher in 2013 than in 2007 and that increased distance to an urban area is no longer protective against HIV as it was in 2007. These findings suggest that HIV education, testing and prevention efforts need to diffuse from urban to rural areas just as HIV is doing. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,6,,,
2085,"The geography of malaria genetics in the Democratic Republic of Congo: A complex and fragmented landscape Understanding how malaria parasites move between populations is important, particularly given the potential for malaria to be reintroduced into areas where it was previously eliminated. We examine the distribution of malaria genetics across seven sites within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and two nearby countries, Ghana and Kenya, in order to understand how the relatedness of malaria parasites varies across space, and whether there are barriers to the flow of malaria parasites within the DRC or across borders. Parasite DNA was retrieved from dried blood spots from 7 Demographic and Health Survey sample clusters in the DRC. Malaria genetic characteristics of parasites from Ghana and Kenya were also obtained. For each of 9 geographic sites (7 DRC, 1 Ghana and 1 Kenya), a pair-wise RST statistic was calculated, indicating the genetic distance between malaria parasites found in those locations. Mapping genetics across the spatial extent of the study area indicates a complex genetic landscape, where relatedness between two proximal sites may be relatively high (RST_>_0.64) or low (RST_< _0.05), and where distal sites also exhibit both high and low genetic similarity. Mantel's tests suggest that malaria genetics differ as geographic distances increase. Principal Coordinate Analysis suggests that genetically related samples are not co-located. Barrier analysis reveals no significant barriers to gene flow between locations. Malaria genetics in the DRC have a complex and fragmented landscape. Limited exchange of genes across space is reflected in greater genetic distance between malaria parasites isolated at greater geographic distances. There is, however, evidence for close genetic ties between distally located sample locations, indicating that movement of malaria parasites and flow of genes is being driven by factors other than distance decay. This research demonstrates the contributions that spatial disease ecology and landscape genetics can make to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases.

2086,"Protection from annual flooding is correlated with increased cholera prevalence in Bangladesh: a zero-inflated regression analysis BACKGROUND: Alteration of natural or historical aquatic flows can have unintended consequences for regions where waterborne diseases are endemic and where the epidemiologic implications of such change are poorly understood. The implementation of flood protection measures for a portion of an intensely monitored population in Matlab, Bangladesh, allows us to examine whether cholera outcomes respond positively or negatively to measures designed to control river flooding. METHODS: Using a zero inflated negative binomial model, we examine how selected covariates can simultaneously account for household clusters reporting no cholera from those with positive counts as well as distinguishing residential areas with low counts from areas with high cholera counts. Our goal is to examine how residence within or outside a flood protected area interacts with the probability of cholera presence and the effect of flood protection on the magnitude of cholera prevalence. RESULTS: In Matlab, living in a household that is protected from annual monsoon flooding appears to have no significant effect on whether the household experiences cholera, net of other covariates. However, counter-intuitively, among households where cholera is reported, living within the flood protected region significantly increases the number of cholera cases. CONCLUSIONS: The construction of dams or other water impoundment strategies for economic or social motives can have profound and unanticipated consequences for waterborne disease. Our results indicate that the construction of a flood control structure in rural Bangladesh is correlated with an increase in cholera cases for residents protected from annual monsoon flooding. Such a finding requires attention from both the health community and from governments and non-governmental organizations involved in ongoing water management schemes.",,,1,,,
2087,Genetic Variation of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses in Vietnam Shows Both Species-Specific and Spatiotemporal Associations ,,,1,,,
2088,"Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses exhibit few barriers to gene flow in Vietnam Locating areas where genetic change is inhibited can illuminate underlying processes that drive evolution of pathogens. The persistence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Vietnam since 2003, and the continuous molecular evolution of Vietnamese avian influenza viruses, indicates that local environmental factors are supportive not only of incidence but also of viral adaptation. This article explores whether gene flow is constant across Vietnam, or whether there exist boundary areas where gene flow exhibits discontinuity. Using a dataset of 125 highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses, principal components analysis and wombling analysis are used to indicate the location, magnitude, and statistical significance of genetic boundaries. Results show that a small number of geographically minor boundaries to gene flow in highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses exist in Vietnam, but that overall there is little division in genetic exchange. This suggests that differences in genetic characteristics of viruses from one region to another are not the result of barriers to H5N1 viral exchange in Vietnam, and that H5N1 avian influenza is able to spread relatively unimpeded across the country.",,,1,,,
2089,"Spatiotemporal structure of molecular evolution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in Vietnam BACKGROUND: Vietnam is one of the countries most affected by outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. First identified in Vietnam in poultry in 2001 and in humans in 2004, the virus has since caused 111 cases and 56 deaths in humans. In 2003/2004 H5N1 outbreaks, nearly the entire poultry population of Vietnam was culled. Our earlier study (Wan et al., 2008, PLoS ONE, 3(10): e3462) demonstrated that there have been at least six independent H5N1 introductions into Vietnam and there were nine newly emerged reassortants from 2001 to 2007 in Vietnam. H5N1 viruses in Vietnam cluster distinctly around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. However, the nature of the relationship between genetic divergence and geographic patterns is still unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we hypothesized that genetic distances between H5N1 viruses in Vietnam are correlated with geographic distances, as the result of distinct population and environment patterns along Vietnam's long north to south longitudinal extent. Based on this hypothesis, we combined spatial statistical methods with genetic analytic techniques and explicitly used geographic space to explore genetic evolution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses at the sub-national scale in Vietnam. Our dataset consisted of 125 influenza viruses (with whole genome sets) isolated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2007. Our results document the significant effect of space and time on genetic evolution and the rise of two regional centers of genetic mixing by 2007. These findings give insight into processes underlying viral evolution and suggest that genetic differentiation is associated with the distance between concentrations of human and poultry populations around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that genetic evolution of H5N1 viruses in Vietnamese domestic poultry is highly correlated with the location and spread of those viruses in geographic space. This correlation varies by scale, time, and gene, though a classic isolation by distance pattern is observed. This study is the first to characterize the geographic structure of influenza viral evolution at the sub-national scale in Vietnam and can shed light on how H5N1 HPAIVs evolve in certain geographic settings.",,,1,,,
2090,"Population-environment drivers of H5N1 avian influenza molecular change in Vietnam This study identifies population and environment drivers of genetic change in H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIV) in Vietnam using a landscape genetics approach. While prior work has examined how combinations of local-level environmental variables influence H5N1 occurrence, this research expands the analysis to the complex genetic characteristics of H5N1 viruses. A dataset of 125 highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV isolated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2007 is used to explore which population and environment variables are correlated with increased genetic change among viruses. Results from non-parametric multidimensional scaling and regression analyses indicate that variables relating to both the environmental and social ecology of humans and birds in Vietnam interact to affect the genetic character of viruses. These findings suggest that it is a combination of suitable environments for species mixing, the presence of high numbers of potential hosts, and in particular the temporal characteristics of viral occurrence, that drive genetic change among H5N1 AIV in Vietnam.

2092,"Characterization of the fecal microbiota using high-throughput sequencing reveals a stable microbial community during storage The handling and treatment of biological samples is critical when characterizing the composition of the intestinal microbiota between different ecological niches or diseases. Specifically, exposure of fecal samples to room temperature or long term storage in deep freezing conditions may alter the composition of the microbiota. Thus, we stored fecal samples at room temperature and monitored the stability of the microbiota over twenty four hours. We also investigated the stability of the microbiota in fecal samples during a six month storage period at -80_C. As the stability of the fecal microbiota may be affected by intestinal disease, we analyzed two healthy controls and two patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We used high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the microbiota in fecal samples stored at room temperature or -80_C at six and seven time points, respectively. The composition of microbial communities in IBS patients and healthy controls were determined and compared using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. The composition of the microbiota in fecal samples stored for different lengths of time at room temperature or -80_C clustered strongly based on the host each sample originated from. Our data demonstrates that fecal samples exposed to room or deep freezing temperatures for up to twenty four hours and six months, respectively, exhibit a microbial composition and diversity that shares more identity with its host of origin than any other sample.",,,1,,,
2093,"Alterations in composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota has been implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Due to the variable resolutions of techniques used to characterize the intestinal microbiota, and the heterogeneity of IBS, the defined alterations of the IBS intestinal microbiota are inconsistent. We analyzed the composition of the intestinal microbiota in a defined subgroup of IBS patients (diarrhea-predominant IBS, D-IBS) using a technique that provides the deepest characterization available for complex microbial communities. METHODS: Fecal DNA was isolated from 23 D-IBS patients and 23 healthy controls (HC). Variable regions V1-V3 and V6 of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified from all samples. PCR products were sequenced using 454 high throughput sequencing. The composition, diversity and richness of microbial communities were determined and compared between D-IBS and HC using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology pipeline. KEY RESULTS: The contribution of bacterial groups to the composition of the intestinal microbiota differed between D-IBS and HC. D-IBS patients had significantly higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.03), and lower levels of Fecalibacterium genera (P = 0.04) compared to HC. _-Diversity values demonstrated significantly lower levels of UniFrac distances in HC compared to D-IBS patients. The richness of 16S rRNA sequences was significantly decreased in D-IBS patients (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Our 16S rRNA sequence data demonstrates a community-level dysbiosis in D-IBS. The altered composition of the intestinal microbiota in D-IBS is associated with significant increases in detrimental and decreases in beneficial bacterial groups, and a reduction in microbial richness. _ 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,1,,,
2094,"Trends and racial differences in the use of androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer CONTEXT: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is widely used to manage the symptoms of advanced prostate cancer and has been shown to slow the progression of the disease. Previous research investigating racial differences in the use of ADT has reported inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess use trends for ADT overall and by type (orchiectomy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists) and the factors associated with time to receipt for metastatic prostate cancer. METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry and Medicare claims database were obtained for 5,273 men, aged 65 years and older and diagnosed with Stage IV prostate cancer during 1991-1999 from seven SEER regions. An accelerated failure time regression model with log-normal distribution was used to examine factors associated with mean time to receipt of ADT. RESULTS: African-American men were less likely than white men to receive any ADT after diagnosis (P< 0.001). Differences were noted in the time to receipt of ADT, with African-American men having a longer mean time to receipt of orchiectomy (time ratio [TR]=1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03, 2.17) or LHRH agonist (TR=1.42; 95% CI=1.06, 1.89) than white men. CONCLUSION: African-American men with metastatic prostate cancer were significantly less likely to receive ADT and, when treated, had a slightly longer time to receipt than white men, which has implications for patients and physicians involved in the palliative management of metastatic prostate cancer.

2095,"Phenotypic and physiologic variability in nasal epithelium cultured from smokers and non-smokers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke The emergence of air-liquid interface (ALI) culturing of mammalian airway epithelium is a recent innovation for experimental modeling of airway epithelial development, function, and pathogenic mechanisms associated with infectious agent and irritant exposure. This construct provides an experimental platform for in vitro propagation, manipulation, and testing of airway epithelium in a structural and physiologic state that emulates in vivo organization. In this study, we have cultured nasal epithelial biopsies from human subjects with variable histories of tobacco smoke exposure and assessed ciliary beat frequency (CBF) after an extended interval in vitro relative to CBF determined on biopsies from the same subjects immediately upon acquisition. We observed elevated CBF in nasal epithelial biopsies as well as persistence of accelerated CBF in ALI cultures deriving from biopsies of smokers and non-smokers exposed to environmental tobacco smoke compared to CBF in cultures from biopsies of well-documented non-smokers. Moreover, cultures deriving from smokers exhibited reduced ciliation as the cultures matured. These studies document that nasal epithelium cultured in the ALI system retains physiologic and phenotypic characteristics of the epithelial layer in vivo even through rounds of proliferative expansion. These observations suggest that stable epigenetic factors affecting regulation of ciliary function and phenotype commitment may be operative.",,,1,,,
2096,"Relationship of neonatal treatments with the development of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants BACKGROUND: Although many therapeutic interventions are necessary for the survival of the preterm infant, understanding the potential effects of these treatments is important to decrease the rate of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between preterm infant treatments administered prior to the development of NEC, specifically the number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, weeks of antibiotic therapy for nosocomial infection, and number of mechanical ventilation days, and the development of NEC in preterm infants. METHODS: A retrospective cohort controlled study design examining 4 years of raw data of preterm infants between the gestational ages of 23 and 30 6/7 weeks was used. Of the 549 infants, there were 65 cases of NEC. Using logistic regression, the relationship between NEC and PRBC transfusions administered prior to NEC, number of mechanical ventilation days prior to NEC, and number of weeks of antibiotic therapy for nosocomial infections experienced prior to NEC (proxy for nosocomial infection) were examined. RESULTS: Preterm infants from 23 to 30 6/7 weeks who developed NEC experienced significantly more PRBC transfusions and more weeks of antibiotic therapy for nosocomial infection prior to the development of NEC than did infants who did not develop NEC. There was no relationship between mechanical ventilation days and the development of NEC. DISCUSSION: Future research should focus on causal relationships between NEC and PRBC administration and the reduction of nosocomial infections in preterm infants to minimize risk for NEC in this population.",,,1,,,

2098,"Body image and body satisfaction differ by race in overweight postpartum mothers BACKGROUND: Body image (BI) and body satisfaction may be important in understanding weight loss behaviors, particularly during the postpartum period. We assessed these constructs among African American and white overweight postpartum women. METHODS: The sample included 162 women (73 African American and 89 white) in the intervention arm 6 months into the Active Mothers Postpartum (AMP) Study, a nutritional and physical activity weight loss intervention. BIs, self-reported using the Stunkard figure rating scale, were compared assessing mean values by race. Body satisfaction was measured using body discrepancy (BD), calculated as perceived current image minus ideal image (BD< 0: desire to be heavier; BD>0: desire to be lighter). BD was assessed by race for: BD(Ideal) (current image minus the ideal image) and BD(Ideal Mother) (current image minus ideal mother image). RESULTS: Compared with white women, African American women were younger and were less likely to report being married, having any college education, or residing in households with annual incomes >$30,000 (all p < 0.01). They also had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.04), although perceived current BI did not differ by race (p = 0.21). African Americans had higher mean ideal (p = 0.07) and ideal mother (p = 0.001) BIs compared with whites. African Americans' mean BDs (adjusting for age, BMI, education, income, marital status, and interaction terms) were significantly lower than those of whites, indicating greater body satisfaction among African Americans (BD(Ideal): 1.7 vs. 2.3, p = 0.005; BD(Ideal Mother): 1.1 vs. 1.8, p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences exist in postpartum weight, ideal images, and body satisfaction. Healthcare providers should consider tailored messaging that accounts for these racially different perceptions and factors when designing weight loss programs for overweight mothers.",,,3,,,

2100,"Report on CTSA consortium use of the community engagement consulting service INTRODUCTION: The CTSA Community Engagement Consultative Service (CECS) is a national partnership designed to improve community engaged research (CEnR) through expert consultation. This report assesses the feasibility of CECS and presents findings from 2008 to 2009. METHODOLOGY: A coordinating center and five regional coordinating sites managed the service. CTSAs identified a primary previsit CE best practice for consultants to address and completed self-assessments, postvisit evaluations, and action plans. Feasibility was assessed as the percent of CTSAs participating and completing evaluations. Frequencies were calculated for evaluation responses. RESULTS: Of the 38 CTSAs, 36 (95%) completed a self-assessment. Of these 36 sites, 83%, 53%, and 44% completed a consultant visit, evaluation, and action plan, respectively, and 56% of the consultants completed an evaluation. The most common best practice identified previsit was improvement in CEnR (addressing outcomes that matter); however, relationship building with communities was most commonly addressed during consulting visits. Although 90% of the consultants were very confident sites could develop an action plan, only 35% were very confident in the CTSAs' abilities to implement one. CONCLUSIONS: Academic medical centers interested in collaborating with communities and translating research to improve health need to further develop their capacity for CE and CEnR within their institutions. _ 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,1,,,
2101,"Pilgrimage to wellness: an exploratory report of rural African American clergy perceptions of church health promotion capacity Churches serve vital roles in African American communities, where disease burden is disproportionately greater and healthcare access is more limited. Although church leadership often must approve programs and activities conducted within churches, little is known about their perception of churches as health promotion organizations, or the impact of church-based health promotion on their own health. This exploratory study assessed perceptions of church capacity to promote health among 27 rural, African American clergy leaders and report the relationship between their own health and that of their congregation. Results indicate a perceived need to increase the capacity of their churches to promote health. Most common were conducting health programs, displaying health information, kitchen committee working with the health ministry, partnerships outside of the church, and funding. Findings lay the foundation for the development of future studies of key factors associated with organizational change and health promotion in these rural church settings.",,,2,,,

2104,"Designing Faith-Based Blood Pressure Interventions to Reach Young Black Men INTRODUCTION: This community-based participatory research pilot study explored multilevel perceptions and strategies for developing future faith-based organization blood pressure interventions for young black men. METHODS: Community partners recruited the sample through two, southeastern U.S. urban churches as potential intervention hubs; academic partners conducted phone interviews with church leader key informants, and three focus groups with black men aged 18-50 years. Qualitative content analysis helped generate themes from: key informant questions assessing organizational assets and capacities, and factors influencing participation; and focus group questions assessing lifestyle and self-management behaviors. Questions assessing themes on blood pressure intervention strategies were asked. Data were collected in 2016 and analyzed in 2016-2017. RESULTS: The sample included 21 key informants and 19 young black men. Key informants' leadership experience averaged 16.6 (SD=12.1) years and 28.6% were male. Focus group participants were primarily single (55.6%), college educated (61.1%), and employed (77.8%). Mean blood pressure was 131.1 (SD=15.3)/79.5 (SD=11.2) mmHg, 33.3% self-reported having hypertension, 88.9% report a family history of hypertension, and 88.9% see a provider annually. For key informants, young black men lack understanding of hypertension despite available resources, and pastors are important role models and advocates. For focus group participants, hidden sodium and stressful, busy schedules impact lifestyle behaviors; and church support for busy schedules are important. Common strategies included incentive-laden, activity-integrated programs, and male social context (testimonials, peer mentoring, engagement outside of the church). CONCLUSIONS: Findings and lessons learned will help design future community-based participatory research, faith-based organization-led blood pressure interventions relevant to young black men.

2105,"Community member and stakeholder perspectives on a healthy environment initiative in north carolina INTRODUCTION: The North Carolina Community Transformation Grant Project (NC-CTG) aimed to implement policy, system, and environmental strategies to promote healthy eating, active living, tobacco-free living, and clinical and community preventive services to advance health equity and reduce health disparities for the state's most vulnerable communities. This article presents findings from the Health Equity Collaborative Evaluation and Implementation Project, which assessed community and stakeholder perceptions of health equity for 3 NC-CTG strategies: farmers markets, shared use, and smoke-free multiunit housing. METHODS: In a triangulated qualitative evaluation, 6 photo elicitation (PE) sessions among 45 community members in 1 urban and 3 rural counties and key informant interviews among 22 stakeholders were conducted. Nine participants from the PE sessions and key informant interviews in the urban county subsequently participated in a stakeholder power analysis and mapping session (SPA) to discuss and identify people and organizations in their community perceived to be influential in addressing health equity-related issues. RESULTS: Evaluations of the PE sessions and key informant interviews indicated that access (convenience, cost, safety, and awareness of products and services) and community fit (community-defined quality, safety, values, and norms) were important constructs across the strategies. The SPA identified specific community- and faith-based organizations, health care organizations, and local government agencies as key stakeholders for future efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Both community fit and access are essential constructs for promoting health equity. Findings demonstrate the feasibility of and need for formative research that engages community members and local stakeholders to shape context-specific, culturally relevant health promotion strategies.",,,2,,,
2106,"Analysis of metabolic syndrome components in >15 000 african americans identifies pleiotropic variants: results from the population architecture using genomics and epidemiology study BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) refers to the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors, including dyslipidemia, central adiposity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia, in individuals. Identification of pleiotropic genetic factors associated with MetS traits may shed light on key pathways or mediators underlying MetS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the Metabochip array in 15 148 African Americans from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, we identify susceptibility loci and investigate pleiotropy among genetic variants using a subset-based meta-analysis method, ASsociation-analysis-based-on-subSETs (ASSET). Unlike conventional models that lack power when associations for MetS components are null or have opposite effects, Association-analysis-based-on-subsets uses 1-sided tests to detect positive and negative associations for components separately and combines tests accounting for correlations among components. With Association-analysis-based-on-subsets, we identify 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 1 glucose and 4 lipids loci (TCF7L2, LPL, APOA5, CETP, and APOC1/APOE/TOMM40) significantly associated with MetS components overall, all P< 2.5e-7, the Bonferroni adjusted P value. Three loci replicate in a Hispanic population, n=5172. A novel African American-specific variant, rs12721054/APOC1, and rs10096633/LPL are associated with _3 MetS components. We find additional evidence of pleiotropy for APOE, TOMM40, TCF7L2, and CETP variants, many with opposing effects (eg, the same rs7901695/TCF7L2 allele is associated with increased odds of high glucose and decreased odds of central adiposity). CONCLUSIONS: We highlight a method to increase power in large-scale genomic association analyses and report a novel variant associated with all MetS components in African Americans. We also identify pleiotropic associations that may be clinically useful in patient risk profiling and for informing translational research of potential gene targets and medications. _ 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,8,,,
2107,"Associations between incident ischemic stroke events and stroke and cardiovascular disease-related genome-wide association studies single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology study BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with ischemic stroke (IS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in European-descent individuals, but their replication in different populations has been largely unexplored. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from GWAS and meta-analyses of stroke, and 86 SNPs previously associated with myocardial infarction and CVD risk factors, including blood lipids (high density lipoprotein [HDL], low density lipoprotein [LDL], and triglycerides), type 2 diabetes, and body mass index (BMI), were investigated for associations with incident IS in European Americans (EA) N=26 276, African-Americans (AA) N=8970, and American Indians (AI) N=3570 from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Study. Ancestry-specific fixed effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting was used to combine study-specific log hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazards models. Two of 9 stroke SNPs (rs783396 and rs1804689) were significantly associated with [corrected] IS hazard in AA; none were significant in this large EA cohort. Of 73 CVD risk factor SNPs tested in EA, 2 (HDL and triglycerides SNPs) were associated with IS. In AA, SNPs associated with LDL, HDL, and BMI were significantly associated with IS (3 of 86 SNPs tested). Out of 58 SNPs tested in AI, 1 LDL SNP was significantly associated with IS. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses showing lack of replication in spite of reasonable power for many stroke SNPs and differing results by ancestry highlight the need to follow up on GWAS findings and conduct genetic association studies in diverse populations. We found modest IS associations with BMI and lipids SNPs, though these findings require confirmation.",,,8,,,
2108,"Replication of genetic loci for ages at menarche and menopause in the multi-ethnic Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study STUDY QUESTION: Do genetic associations identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of age at menarche (AM) and age at natural menopause (ANM) replicate in women of diverse race/ancestry from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study? SUMMARY ANSWER: We replicated GWAS reproductive trait single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in our European descent population and found that many SNPs were also associated with AM and ANM in populations of diverse ancestry. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Menarche and menopause mark the reproductive lifespan in women and are important risk factors for chronic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Both events are believed to be influenced by environmental and genetic factors, and vary in populations differing by genetic ancestry and geography. Most genetic variants associated with these traits have been identified in GWAS of European-descent populations. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A total of 42 251 women of diverse ancestry from PAGE were included in cross-sectional analyses of AM and ANM. MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: SNPs previously associated with ANM (n = 5 SNPs) and AM (n = 3 SNPs) in GWAS were genotyped in American Indians, African Americans, Asians, European Americans, Hispanics and Native Hawaiians. To test SNP associations with ANM or AM, we used linear regression models stratified by race/ethnicity and PAGE sub-study. Results were then combined in race-specific fixed effect meta-analyses for each outcome. For replication and generalization analyses, significance was defined at P < 0.01 for ANM analyses and P < 0.017 for AM analyses. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We replicated findings for AM SNPs in the LIN28B locus and an intergenic region on 9q31 in European Americans. The LIN28B SNPs (rs314277 and rs314280) were also significantly associated with AM in Asians, but not in other race/ethnicity groups. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns at this locus varied widely among the ancestral groups. With the exception of an intergenic SNP at 13q34, all ANM SNPs replicated in European Americans. Three were significantly associated with ANM in other race/ethnicity populations: rs2153157 (6p24.2/SYCP2L), rs365132 (5q35/UIMC1) and rs16991615 (20p12.3/MCM8). While rs1172822 (19q13/BRSK1) was not significant in the populations of non-European descent, effect sizes showed similar trends. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Lack of association for the GWAS SNPs in the non-European American groups may be due to differences in locus LD patterns between these groups and the European-descent populations included in the GWAS discovery studies; and in some cases, lower power may also contribute to non-significant findings. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The discovery of genetic variants associated with the reproductive traits provides an important opportunity to elucidate the biological mechanisms involved with normal variation and disorders of menarche and menopause. In this study we replicated most, but not all reported SNPs in European descent populations and examined the epidemiologic architecture of these early reported variants, describing their generalizability and effect size across differing ancestral populations. Such data will be increasingly important for prioritizing GWAS SNPs for follow-up in fine-mapping and resequencing studies, as well as in translational research.",,,8,,,

METHODS: Among 3384 adults with self-reported diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes in the baseline HCHS/SOL, we estimated odds ratios (OR) of being undiagnosed for demographic, cultural, access to care, and health factors. RESULTS: Among individuals with diabetes, 37.0% were undiagnosed. After adjustment and compared to people of Mexican heritage, people of Cuban and South American heritage had 60% (OR_=_1.60, 95% CI_=_1.02-2.50) and 91% (OR_=_1.91, 1.16-3.14) higher odds of being undiagnosed, respectively. Individuals with a higher odds of being undiagnosed were women (OR_=_1.64, 1.26-2.13), those with no health insurance (OR_=_1.31, 1.00-1.71), individuals who received no healthcare in the past year (OR_=_3.59, 2.49-5.16), those who were overweight (vs. normal weight) (OR_=_1.60, 1.02-2.50), and those with dyslipidemia (OR_=_1.38, 1.10-1.74). Individuals with lower odds of being undiagnosed were those with a family history of diabetes (OR_=_0.54, 0.43-0.68), and those with hypertension (OR_=_0.46, 0.36-0.58).

2111,"Variations of dietary intake by glycemic status and Hispanic/Latino heritage in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Objective: A healthy diet is important for diabetes prevention and control; however, few studies have assessed dietary intake among US Hispanics/Latinos, a diverse population with a significant burden of diabetes. To address this gap in the literature, we determined intake of energy, macro/micronutrients, and vitamin supplements among Hispanics/Latinos by glycemic status and heritage. Research design and methods: Cross-sectional study of adults aged 18-74 years from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (2008-2011) with complete baseline data on glycemic status and two 24-hour dietary recalls (n=13_089). Age-adjusted and sex-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted measures of intake were determined by glycemic status and heritage. Results: Mean age-adjusted and sex-adjusted energy intake was significantly lower among Hispanics/Latinos with diagnosed diabetes compared with those with normal glycemic status (1665 vs 1873 kcal, P< 0.001). Fiber intake was higher among those with diagnosed diabetes versus normal glycemic status (P< 0.01). Among those with diagnosed diabetes, energy intake was highest among those with Cuban heritage compared with most other heritage groups (P< 0.01 for all, except Mexicans), but there was no difference after additional adjustment. Fiber intake was significantly lower for those of Cuban heritage (vs Dominican, Central American, and Mexican), and sodium intake was significantly higher (vs all other heritage groups) (P< 0.01 for all); findings were null after additional adjustment. There was no difference in supplemental intake of vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, or potassium by glycemic status. Conclusions: As part of the care of Hispanics/Latinos with diabetes, attention should be made to fiber and sodium consumption.",,,4,,,
2112,"Factors affecting continued use of ceramic water purifiers distributed to tsunami-affected communities in Sri Lanka OBJECTIVES: There is little information about continued use of point-of-use technologies after disaster relief efforts. After the 2004 tsunami, the Red Cross distributed ceramic water filters in Sri Lanka. This study determined factors associated with filter disuse and evaluate the quality of household drinking water. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of water sources and treatment, filter use and household characteristics was administered by in-person oral interview, and household water quality was tested. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model probability of filter non-use. RESULTS: At the time of survey, 24% of households (107/452) did not use filters; the most common reason given was breakage (42%). The most common household water sources were taps and wells. Wells were used by 45% of filter users and 28% of non-users. Of households with taps, 75% had source water Escherichia coli in the lowest World Health Organisation risk category (< 1/100 ml), vs. only 30% of households reporting wells did. Tap households were approximately four times more likely to discontinue filter use than well households. CONCLUSION: After 2 years, 24% of households were non-users. The main factors were breakage and household water source; households with taps were more likely to stop use than households with wells. Tap water users also had higher-quality source water, suggesting that disuse is not necessarily negative and monitoring of water quality can aid decision-making about continued use. To promote continued use, disaster recovery filter distribution efforts must be joined with capacity building for long-term water monitoring, supply chains and local production. _ 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,1,,,
2113,"Role of HGF in epithelial-stromal cell interactions during progression from benign breast disease to ductal carcinoma in situ INTRODUCTION: Basal-like and luminal breast cancers have distinct stromal-epithelial interactions, which play a role in progression to invasive cancer. However, little is known about how stromal-epithelial interactions evolve in benign and pre-invasive lesions. METHODS: To study epithelial-stromal interactions in basal-like breast cancer progression, we cocultured reduction mammoplasty fibroblasts with the isogenic MCF10 series of cell lines (representing benign/normal, atypical hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ). We used gene expression microarrays to identify pathways induced by coculture in premalignant cells (MCF10DCIS) compared with normal and benign cells (MCF10A and MCF10AT1). Relevant pathways were then evaluated in vivo for associations with basal-like subtype and were targeted in vitro to evaluate effects on morphogenesis. RESULTS: Our results show that premalignant MCF10DCIS cells express characteristic gene expression patterns of invasive basal-like microenvironments. Furthermore, while hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secretion is upregulated (relative to normal, MCF10A levels) when fibroblasts are cocultured with either atypical (MCF10AT1) or premalignant (MCF10DCIS) cells, only MCF10DCIS cells upregulated the HGF receptor MET. In three-dimensional cultures, upregulation of HGF/MET in MCF10DCIS cells induced morphological changes suggestive of invasive potential, and these changes were reversed by antibody-based blocking of HGF signaling. These results are relevant to in vivo progression because high expression of a novel MCF10DCIS-derived HGF signature was correlated with the basallike subtype, with approximately 86% of basal-like cancers highly expressing the HGF signature, and because high expression of HGF signature was associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Coordinated and complementary changes in HGF/MET expression occur in epithelium and stroma during progression of pre-invasive basal-like lesions. These results suggest that targeting stroma-derived HGF signaling in early carcinogenesis may block progression of basal-like precursor lesions.",,,3,,,
2114,"Gene expression analysis of in vitro cocultures to study interactions between breast epithelium and stroma The interactions between breast epithelium and stroma are fundamental to normal tissue homeostasis and for tumor initiation and progression. Gene expression studies of in vitro coculture models demonstrate that in vitro models have relevance for tumor progression in vivo. For example, stromal gene expression has been shown to vary in association with tumor subtype in vivo, and analogous in vitro cocultures recapitulate subtype-specific biological interactions. Cocultures can be used to study cancer cell interactions with specific stromal components (e.g., immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelium) and different representative cell lines (e.g., cancer-associated versus normal-associated fibroblasts versus established, immortalized fibroblasts) can help elucidate the role of stromal variation in tumor phenotypes. Gene expression data can also be combined with cell-based assays to identify cellular phenotypes associated with gene expression changes. Coculture systems are manipulable systems that can yield important insights about cell-cell interactions and the cellular phenotypes that occur as tumor and stroma co-evolve.",,,3,,,
2115,"Tumor intrinsic subtype is reflected in cancer-adjacent tissue INTRODUCTION: Overall survival of early-stage breast cancer patients is similar for those who undergo breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy; however, 10% to 15% of women undergoing BCT suffer ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. The risk of recurrence may vary with breast cancer subtype. Understanding the gene expression of the cancer-adjacent tissue and the stromal response to specific tumor subtypes is important for developing clinical strategies to reduce recurrence risk. METHODS: We utilized two independent datasets to study gene expression data in cancer-adjacent tissue from invasive breast cancer patients. Complementary in vitro cocultures were used to study cell-cell communication between fibroblasts and specific breast cancer subtypes. RESULTS: Our results suggest that intrinsic tumor subtypes are reflected in histologically normal cancer-adjacent tissue. Gene expression of cancer-adjacent tissues shows that triple-negative (Claudin-low or basal-like) tumors exhibit increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune response. Although such changes could reflect distinct immune populations present in the microenvironment, altered immune response gene expression was also observed in cocultures in the absence of immune cell infiltrates, emphasizing that these inflammatory mediators are secreted by breast-specific cells. In addition, although triple-negative breast cancers are associated with upregulated immune response genes, luminal breast cancers are more commonly associated with estrogen-response pathways in adjacent tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Specific characteristics of breast cancers are reflected in the surrounding histologically normal tissue. This commonality between tumor and cancer-adjacent tissue may underlie second primaries and local recurrences. IMPACT: Biomarkers derived from cancer-adjacent tissue may be helpful in defining personalized surgical strategies or in predicting recurrence risk. _2014 American Association for Cancer Research.",,,3,,,
2116,"Minimum-distance requirements could harm high-performing critical-access hospitals and rural communities Since the inception of the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program in 1997, over 1,300 rural hospitals have converted to critical-access hospitals, which entitles them to Medicare cost-based reimbursement instead of reimbursement based on the hospital prospective payment system (PPS). Several changes to eligibility for critical-access status have recently been proposed. Most of the changes focus on mandating that hospitals be located a certain minimum distance from the nearest hospital. Our study found that critical-access hospitals located within fifteen miles of another hospital generally are larger, provide better quality, and are financially stronger compared to critical-access hospitals located farther from another hospital. Returning to the PPS would have considerable negative impacts on critical-access hospitals that are located near another hospital. We conclude that establishing a minimum-distance requirement would generate modest cost savings for Medicare but would likely be disruptive to the communities that depend on these hospitals for their health care.

2117,"Cholera and shigellosis: different epidemiology but similar responses to climate variability BACKGROUND: Comparative studies of the associations between different infectious diseases and climate variability, such as the El Ni_o-Southern Oscillation, are lacking. Diarrheal illnesses, particularly cholera and shigellosis, provide an important opportunity to apply a comparative approach. Cholera and shigellosis have significant global mortality and morbidity burden, pronounced differences in transmission pathways and pathogen ecologies, and there is an established climate link with cholera. In particular, the specific ecology of Vibrio cholerae is often invoked to explain the sensitivity of that disease to climate. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The extensive surveillance data of the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh are used here to revisit the known associations between cholera and climate, and to address their similarity to previously unexplored patterns for shigellosis. Monthly case data for both the city of Dhaka and a rural area known as Matlab are analyzed with respect to their association with El Ni_o and flooding. Linear correlations are examined between flooding and cumulative cases, as well as for flooding and El Ni_o. Rank-correlation maps are also computed between disease cases in the post-monsoon epidemic season and sea surface temperatures in the Pacific. Similar climate associations are found for both diseases and both locations. Increased cases follow increased monsoon flooding and increased sea surface temperatures in the preceding winter corresponding to an El Ni_o event. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity in association patterns suggests a systemic breakdown in population health with changing environmental conditions, in which climate variability acts primarily through increasing the exposure risk of the human population. We discuss these results in the context of the on-going debate on the relative importance of the environmental reservoir vs. secondary transmission, as well as the implications for the use of El Ni_o as an early indicator of flooding and enteric disease risk.",,,1,,,
2118,"Exploring the sexual health priorities and needs of immigrant Latinas in the southeastern United States: a community-based participatory research approach Latinas living in the United States are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections. However, few effective interventions currently exist that are designed to meet the priorities and needs of recently arrived and less acculturated immigrant Latinas who are settling in the southeastern United States. To identify sexual health priorities, gaps in information and skills, and key intervention characteristics to improve sexual health among immigrant Latinas, a community-based participatory research partnership conducted four focus groups with Latinas, in central North Carolina. Findings revealed a lack of knowledge about sexual health, shame and embarrassment related to clinical exams and conversations about sex, multilevel barriers to sexual health, and disease transmission misinformation. Findings also suggested that interventions should include information about a broad range of sexual and reproductive health topics and skill building. Such interventions could serve to assist in diminishing health disparities experienced among this vulnerable population.",,,5,,,
2119,"Financial Toxicity among Patients with Bladder Cancer: Reasons for Delay in Care and Effect on Quality of Life PURPOSE: Costly surveillance and treatment of bladder cancer can lead to financial toxicity, a treatment related financial burden. Our objective was to define the prevalence of financial toxicity among patients with bladder cancer and identify delays in care and its effect on health related quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients with bladder cancer in the University of North Carolina Health Registry/Cancer Survivorship Cohort. Financial toxicity was defined as agreement with having ""to pay more for medical care than you can afford."" Health related quality of life was measured using general and cancer specific validated questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test and the Student t-test. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with bladder cancer were evaluated. Median age was 66.9 years, 75% of the patients were male and 89% were white. Of the participants 33 (24%) endorsed financial toxicity. Participants who were younger (p = 0.02), black (p = 0.01), reported less than a college degree (p = 0.01) and had noninvasive disease (p = 0.04) were more likely to report financial toxicity. On multivariable analysis only age was a significant predictor of financial toxicity. Patients who endorsed financial toxicity were more likely to report delaying care (39% vs 23%, p = 0.07) due to the inability to take time off work or afford general expenses. On general health related quality of life questionnaires patients with financial toxicity reported worse physical and mental health (p = 0.03 and < 0.01, respectively), and lower cancer specific health related quality of life (p = 0.01), physical well-being (p = 0.01) and functional well-being (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Financial toxicity is a major concern among patients with bladder cancer. Younger patients were more likely to experience financial toxicity. Those who endorsed financial toxicity experienced delays in care and poorer health related quality of life, suggesting that treatment costs should have an important role in medical decision making.

2120,"Cardiovascular disease risk factors and psychological distress among Hispanics/Latinos: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Studies show that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are correlated with psychological distress, yet research examining these relationships among Hispanic/Latinos is lacking. The population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos enrolled a cohort of Hispanic/Latino adults (N=16,415) 18-74years of age at the time of recruitment, from four US metropolitan areas, between March 2008 and June 2011. Psychological distress (i.e., 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, 10 item Spielberger Trait Anxiety Scale, and a combined depression/anxiety score), socio-demographics (i.e., age, education, income, insurance, sex, and Hispanic/Latino background), acculturation (i.e., country of birth and language preference), and traditional CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, obesity, current cigarette smoking, diabetes, and hypertension) were assessed at baseline. Associations between CVD risk factors and psychological distress measures by sex were examined using multiple linear regression models, accounting for complex survey design and sampling weights and controlling for socio-demographic and acculturation covariates. In adjusted analyses, all three psychological distress measures were significantly related to smoking. For females, greater psychological distress was significantly related to obesity and current smoking. For males, diabetes and current smoking were associated with psychological distress. For males and females, dyslipidemia and hypertension were not associated with psychological distress after adjusting for other factors. Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with CVD risk factors for Hispanic/Latino men and women. However, these results were not consistent across Hispanic/Latino groups. As promoted by the integrative care model, psychosocial concerns should be considered in research on CVD risk and chronic disease prevention. Copyright _ 2016 Elsevier Inc.

2121,"Colorectal cancer screening among Hispanics/Latinos in the HCHS/SOL sociocultural ancillary study Latino adults are more likely to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) at later stages compared to white adults which may be explained by disparities in screening rates. The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with three CRC screening indicators [i.e., 1) any CRC screening ever (via, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy); 2) FOBT in last year, 3) sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy in last 10__ears) among US Hispanics/Latinos. We analyzed population-based data collected in 2008-2011 from 2265 adults aged 50-75 from San Diego, Bronx, Miami and Chicago from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Based on the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, the following correlates of CRC screening were examined: predisposing (i.e., age, education, income, acculturation), enabling (i.e., recent physician visit, insurance, recent mammogram), and need (i.e., health-related quality of life and family/personal history of cancer) factors. Separate logistic regression models were analyzed for the three CRC screening indicators. Enabling factors associated with all CRC screening indicators included: health insurance, a recent physician visit, and a mammogram in the last year (women only). For women, being older, more acculturated (i.e., English language or foreign-born but in the US for 10 or more years), and having a personal history of cancer was associated with at least one CRC screening. Findings suggest that improving access and utilization of care among Hispanics/Latinos may be critical for earlier CRC diagnosis and survival.",,,3,,,
2122,"Novel genetic variants for cartilage thickness and hip osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is one of the most frequent and disabling diseases of the elderly. Only few genetic variants have been identified for osteoarthritis, which is partly due to large phenotype heterogeneity. To reduce heterogeneity, we here examined cartilage thickness, one of the structural components of joint health. We conducted a genome-wide association study of minimal joint space width (mJSW), a proxy for cartilage thickness, in a discovery set of 13,013 participants from five different cohorts and replication in 8,227 individuals from seven independent cohorts. We identified five genome-wide significant (GWS, P_5_0_10-8) SNPs annotated to four distinct loci. In addition, we found two additional loci that were significantly replicated, but results of combined meta-analysis fell just below the genome wide significance threshold. The four novel associated genetic loci were located in/near TGFA (rs2862851), PIK3R1 (rs10471753), SLBP/FGFR3 (rs2236995), and TREH/DDX6 (rs496547), while the other two (DOT1L and SUPT3H/RUNX2) were previously identified. A systematic prioritization for underlying causal genes was performed using diverse lines of evidence. Exome sequencing data (n = 2,050 individuals) indicated that there were no rare exonic variants that could explain the identified associations. In addition, TGFA, FGFR3 and PIK3R1 were differentially expressed in OA cartilage lesions versus non-lesioned cartilage in the same individuals. In conclusion, we identified four novel loci (TGFA, PIK3R1, FGFR3 and TREH) and confirmed two loci known to be associated with cartilage thickness.The identified associations were not caused by rare exonic variants. This is the first report linking TGFA to human OA, which may serve as a new target for future therapies.",,,8,,,
2123,"Why Did Zika Not Explode in Cuba? The Role of Active Community Participation to Sustain Control of Vector-Borne Diseases As the global public health community develops strategies for sustainable Zika prevention and control, assessment of the Cuban response to Zika provides critical lessons learned. Cuba's early and successful response to Zika, grounded in the country's long-standing dengue prevention and control program, serves as a model of rapid mobilization of intersectoral efforts. Sustaining this response requires applying the evidence generated within the Cuban dengue program that active community participation improves outcomes and is sustainable and cost-effective. There is also a need for implementation science efforts to assess the transferability of lessons learned from Zika prevention and control to other pathogens and from one context to another in addition to how to take these efforts to scale.",,,1,,,
2124,"Exploring the experiences of women and health care workers in the context of PMTCT option B plus in malawi INTRODUCTION: Malawi has embarked on a ""test-and-treat"" approach to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, known as ""Option B+,"" offering all HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage. A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted to explore early experiences surrounding ""Option B+"" for patients and health care workers (HCWs) in Malawi. METHODS: Study participants were purposively selected across 6 health facilities in 3 regional health zones in Malawi. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with women enrolled in ""Option B+"" (n = 24), and focus group discussions were conducted with HCWs providing Option B+ services (n = 6 groups of 8 HCWs). Data were analyzed using a qualitative thematic coding framework. RESULTS: Patients and HCWs identified the lack of male involvement as a barrier to retention in care and expressed concerns at the rapidity of the test-and-treat process, which makes it difficult for patients to ""digest"" a positive diagnosis before starting ART. Fear regarding the breach of privacy and confidentiality were also identified as contributing to loss to follow-up of women initiated under the Option B+. Disclosure remains a difficult process within families and couples. Lifelong ART was also perceived as an opportunity to plan future pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: As ""Option B+"" continues to be rolled out, novel interventions to support and retain women into care must be implemented. These include providing space, time, and support to accept a diagnosis before starting ART, engaging partners and families, and addressing the need for peer support and confidentiality.",,,6,,,
2125,"The Effects of Viral Load Burden on Pregnancy Loss among HIV-Infected Women in the United States BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effects of HIV viral load, measured cross-sectionally and cumulatively, on the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth (pregnancy loss) among HIV-infected women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study between 1994 and 2013. METHODS: We assessed three exposures: most recent viral load measure before the pregnancy ended, log10 copy-years viremia from initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to conception, and log10 copy-years viremia in the two years before conception. RESULTS: The risk of pregnancy loss for those with log10 viral load >4.00 before pregnancy ended was 1.59 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99, 2.56) times as high as the risk for women whose log10 viral load was _1.60. There was not a meaningful impact of log10 copy-years viremia since ART or log10 copy-years viremia in the two years before conception on pregnancy loss (adjusted risk ratios (aRRs): 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.92) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.11), resp.). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative viral load burden does not appear to be an informative measure for pregnancy loss risk, but the extent of HIV replication during pregnancy, as represented by plasma HIV RNA viral load, predicted loss versus live birth in this ethnically diverse cohort of HIV-infected US women.",,,6,,,
2126,"Reducing concurrent sexual partnerships among blacks in the rural southeastern united states: development of narrative messages for a radio campaign In the United States, heterosexual transmission of HIV infection is dramatically higher among Blacks than among Whites. Overlapping (concurrent) sexual partnerships promote HIV transmission. The authors describe their process for developing a radio campaign (Escape the Web) to raise awareness among 18-34-year-old Black adults of the effect of concurrency on HIV transmission in the rural South. Radio is a powerful channel for the delivery of narrative-style health messages. Through six focus groups (n = 51) and 42 intercept interviews, the authors explored attitudes toward concurrency and solicited feedback on sample messages. Men were advised to (a) end concurrent partnerships and not to begin new ones; (b) use condoms consistently with all partners; and (c) tell others about the risks of concurrency and benefits of ending concurrent partnerships. The narrative portrayed risky behaviors that trigger initiation of casual partnerships. Women were advised to (a) end partnerships in which they are not their partner's only partner; (b) use condoms consistently with all partners; and (c) tell others about the risks of concurrency and benefits of ending concurrent partnerships.

2127,"How parents hear about human papillomavirus vaccine: implications for uptake PURPOSE: To examine correlates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine awareness and information sources in a state requiring schools to inform parents about HPV vaccine. METHODS: Telephone survey of a North Carolina population-based sample of 696 parents of females aged 10-17 years about HPV vaccine awareness and information sources (daughters' schools, healthcare provider, drug company advertisements, news stories) was conducted. RESULTS: Overall, 91% of parents had heard of HPV vaccine. Parents were more likely to be aware if they had household incomes of $50,000 or higher, were women, had non-Hispanic white daughters, or had daughters vaccinated against meningitis. Information sources included drug company advertisements (64%), healthcare providers (50%), news stories (50%), and schools (9%). Only parents who heard from their children's healthcare providers were more likely to initiate HPV vaccine for their daughters. CONCLUSIONS: Parents had rarely heard of the vaccine through schools. The only source associated with vaccine initiation was hearing from a healthcare provider.",,,0,,,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We analyzed 985 New York City adult participants aged 18-81 years from the Physical Activity and Redesigned Community Spaces (PARCS) study. Participants were asked to wear a hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X-BT accelerometer for one week. Adherent accelerometer wear was defined as _3 days of _8__/day of wear over a 7-day period and non-adherent accelerometry wear was defined as any wear less than adherent wear from returned accelerometers. Examined correlates of adherence included sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics (e.g., general physical/mental health-related quality of life, self-efficacy for exercise, stress, sense of community/neighborhood well-being, and social cohesion). RESULTS: From the total sample, 636 (64.6%) participants provided adherent wear and 349 (35.4%) provided non-adherent wear. In multivariable analysis, younger age (odds ratio [OR]_=_0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.75), poorer health-related quality of life (OR_=_0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.98 for physical health and OR_=_0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.94 for mental health), lower sense of community (OR_=_0.79, 95% CI: 0.62-1.00) and current smoking status (OR_=_1.97, 95% CI: 1.35-2.86) were associated with non-adherent wear. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherent wear was associated with younger age, smoking, and lower self-reported physical/mental functioning and sense of community. This information can inform targeted adherence strategies to improve physical activity and sedentary behavior estimates from accelerometry data in future studies involving an urban minority population.

2130,"Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-2 is expressed in spermatic germ cells and incorporates arachidonic acid into triacylglycerols BACKGROUND: De novo glycerolipid synthesis begins with the acylation of glycerol-3 phosphate catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT). In mammals, at least four GPAT isoforms have been described, differing in their cell and tissue locations and sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents. In this work we show that mitochondrial GPAT2 overexpression in CHO-K1 cells increased TAG content and both GPAT and AGPAT activities 2-fold with arachidonoyl-CoA as a substrate, indicating specificity for this fatty acid. METHODS AND RESULTS: Incubation of GPAT2-transfected CHO-K1 cells with [1-(14)C]arachidonate for 3 h increased incorporation of [(14)C]arachidonate into TAG by 40%. Consistently, arachidonic acid was present in the TAG fraction of cells that overexpressed GPAT2, but not in control cells, corroborating GPAT2's role in synthesizing TAG that is rich in arachidonic acid. In rat and mouse testis, Gpat2 mRNA was expressed only in primary spermatocytes; the protein was also detected in late stages of spermatogenesis. During rat sexual maturation, both the testicular TAG content and the arachidonic acid content in the TAG fraction peaked at 30 d, matching the highest expression of Gpat2 mRNA and protein. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that GPAT2 expression is linked to arachidonoyl-CoA incorporation into TAG in spermatogenic germ cells.",,,7,,,
2131,"Protein modification by deamidation indicates variations in joint extracellular matrix turnover As extracellular proteins age, they undergo and accumulate nonenzymatic post-translational modifications that cannot be repaired. We hypothesized that these could be used to systemically monitor loss of extracellular matrix due to chronic arthritic diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). To test this, we predicted sites of deamidation in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and confirmed, by mass spectroscopy, the presence of deamidated (Asp(64)) and native (Asn(64)) COMP epitopes (mean 0.95% deamidated COMP (D-COMP) relative to native COMP) in cartilage. An Asp(64), D-COMP-specific ELISA was developed using a newly created monoclonal antibody 6-1A12. In a joint replacement study, serum D-COMP (p = 0.017), but not total COMP (p = 0.5), declined significantly after replacement demonstrating a joint tissue source for D-COMP. In analyses of 450 participants from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project controlled for age, gender, and race, D-COMP was associated with radiographic hip (p < 0.0001) but not knee (p = 0.95) OA severity. In contrast, total COMP was associated with radiographic knee (p < 0.0001) but not hip (p = 0.47) OA severity. D-COMP was higher in soluble proteins extracted from hip cartilage proximal to OA lesions compared with remote from lesions (p = 0.007) or lesional and remote OA knee (p < 0.01) cartilage. Total COMP in cartilage did not vary by joint site or proximity to the lesion. This study demonstrates the presence of D-COMP in articular cartilage and the systemic circulation, and to our knowledge, it is the first biomarker to show specificity for a particular joint site. We believe that enrichment of deamidated epitope in hip OA cartilage indicates a lesser repair response of hip OA compared with knee OA cartilage.",,,9,,,
2132,"Outcomes of patients with anemia and acute decompensated heart failure with preserved versus reduced ejection fraction (from the ARIC study community surveillance) Anemia is associated with poor prognosis in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Whether the impact of anemia differs by heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is uncertain. We examined hospital surveillance data captured by the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010. Diagnoses of ADHF were validated by standardized physician review of the medical record. Anemia was classified using the World Health Organization criteria (< 12_g/dl for women and < 13_g/dl for men), and HF type was determined by the ejection fraction (< 40% for HFrEF and _40% for HFpEF). Hospital length of stay and 1-year mortality outcomes were analyzed by multivariable regression, weighted to account for the sampling design, and adjusted for demographics and clinical covariates. Over 6_years, 15,461 (weighted) hospitalized events for ADHF (59% HFrEF) occurred in the catchment of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, based on 3,309 sampled events. Anemia was associated with a mortality hazard ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6 to 2.7) in patients classified with HFpEF and 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7) in those with HFrEF; p for interaction_= 0.05. The mean increase in length of hospital stay associated with anemia was 3.5_days (95% CI 3.4 to 3.6) for patients with HFpEF, compared with 1.8_days (95% CI 1.7 to 1.9) for those with HFrEF; p for interaction < 0.0001. In conclusion, the incremental risks of death and lengthened hospital stay associated with anemia are more pronounced in ADHF patients classified with HFpEF than HFrEF. Copyright _ 2014 Elsevier Inc.

2133,"Thirty-year risk of ischemic stroke in individuals with sickle cell trait and modification by chronic kidney disease: The atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study Sickle cell trait (SCT) has been associated with hypercoagulability, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and ischemic stroke. Whether concomitant CKD modifies long-term ischemic stroke risk in individuals with SCT is uncertain. We analyzed data from 3602 genotyped black adults (female = 62%, mean baseline age = 54__ears) who were followed for a median 26__ears by the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Ischemic stroke was verified by physician review. Associations between SCT and ischemic stroke were analyzed using repeat-events Cox regression, adjusted for potential confounders. SCT was identified in 236 (7%) participants, who more often had CKD at baseline than noncarriers (18% vs 13%, P = .02). Among those with CKD, elevated factor VII activity was more prevalent with SCT genotype (36% vs 22%; P = .05). From 1987-2017, 555 ischemic strokes occurred in 436 individuals. The overall hazard ratio of ischemic stroke associated with SCT was 1.31 (95% CI: 0.95-1.80) and was stronger in participants with concomitant CKD (HR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.16-4.12) than those without CKD (HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.74-1.61); P for interaction = .04. The hazard ratio of composite ischemic stroke and/or death associated with SCT was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.01-1.42) overall, 1.44 (95% CI: 1.002-2.07) among those with CKD, and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.94-1.39) among those without CKD; P for interaction = .18.

2134,"Associations between echocardiographic arterial compliance and incident cardiovascular disease in blacks: the ARIC study BACKGROUND: Systemic arterial compliance is sometimes derived by echocardiographic stroke volume to pulse pressure ratios. Few studies have assessed echocardiographic arterial compliance in blacks or its associations with explicit, rather than composite, cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed a subset (n = 1,887) of blacks (mean age = 59 _ 6 years; 65% women) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study who were free of prevalent CVD and were imaged by echocardiography in 1993-1995. Arterial compliance was calculated by the aortic velocity time integral and brachial pulse pressure ratio (VTI/PP). Associations between VTI/PP and subsequent CVD (defined as first incident stroke, coronary event, or heart failure) were modeled by Cox regression after controlling for demographics, anthropometry, and cardiac risk factors. For comparison, CVD hazard ratios were also calculated for pulse pressure quartiles. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 13 _ 4 years, 237 subjects (12%) developed coronary disease, 322 (16%) developed heart failure, and 180 (9%) experienced a stroke. Hazard ratios contrasting lowest with highest quartiles of VTI/PP were 2.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7-3.1) for composite CVD, 2.1 (95% CI = 1.3-3.2) for coronary disease, 2.5 (95% CI = 1.7-3.6) for heart failure, and 2.7 (95% CI = 1.6-4.5) for stroke. Hazard ratios contrasting widest with narrowest pulse pressure quartiles were 1.7 (95% CI = 1.3-2.2) for composite CVD, 1.6 (95% CI = 1.0-2.4) for coronary heart disease, 1.8 (95% CI = 1.2-2.6) for heart failure, and 2.3 (95% CI = 1.3-3.9) for stroke. CONCLUSIONS: In blacks, the VTI/PP ratio has stronger associations with both composite and individual CVD outcomes than does pulse pressure. _ American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2014.

2135,"Sickle cell trait and incident ischemic stroke in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Numerous case reports describe stroke in individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) in the absence of traditional risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. To date, no prospective epidemiological studies have investigated this association. METHODS: A population-based sample of blacks (n=3497; mean age=54 years; female=62%) was followed from 1987 to 2011 in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, contributing a total of 65 371 person-years. Hazard ratios and incidence rate differences for ischemic stroke were estimated, contrasting SCT to homozygous hemoglobin A. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, total cholesterol, atrial fibrillation, and coronary heart disease. RESULTS: SCT was identified in 223 (6.4%) participants. During a median follow-up of 22 years, 401 subjects experienced incident stroke (89% ischemic). Incident ischemic stroke was more frequent among those with SCT (13%) than those with homozygous hemoglobin A (10%). SCT was associated with an ischemic stroke hazard ratio of 1.4 (1.0-2.0) and an incidence rate difference amounting to 1.9 (0.4-3.8) extra strokes per 1000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increased risk of ischemic stroke in blacks with SCT. Further investigation of the incidence and pathophysiology of stroke in patients with SCT is warranted. _ 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,8,,,
2136,"The role of companionship, esteem, and informational support in explaining physical activity among young women in an online social network intervention The primary objective of the current study was to examine the relationship between social support and physical activity within the theory of planned behavior (TPB) theoretical framework. This study used data from the Internet Support for Healthy Associations Promoting Exercise randomized controlled trial. A total of 134 female undergraduate students participated in the study, which included baseline and post measures of perceived social support for physical activity (esteem, informational, and companionship), TPB variables related to physical activity (perceived behavioral control, intention, and attitude), and physical activity behavior. Path analysis revealed a significant indirect relationship between change in companionship support and physical activity mediated by change in intention (.13, p < .01) and a significant direct relationship between change in esteem support and change in physical activity (.26, p = .03). The model explained 27% of the variance in physical activity and 59% of the variance in intention. Overall, change in social support exerted a small to medium amount of influence on change in physical activity in this modified TPB model when controlling for traditional model constructs. Encouraging companionship and esteem support should be considered as a strategy for increasing physical activity in this population.",,,9,,,
2137,"A social media-based physical activity intervention: a randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND: Online social networks, such as Facebook_, have extensive reach, and they use technology that could enhance social support, an established determinant of physical activity. This combination of reach and functionality makes online social networks a promising intervention platform for increasing physical activity. PURPOSE: To test the efficacy of a physical activity intervention that combined education, physical activity monitoring, and online social networking to increase social support for physical activity compared to an education-only control. DESIGN: RCT. Students (n=134) were randomized to two groups: education-only controls receiving access to a physical activity-focused website (n=67) and intervention participants receiving access to the same website with physical activity self-monitoring and enrollment in a Facebook group (n=67). Recruitment and data collection occurred in 2010 and 2011; data analyses were performed in 2011. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Female undergraduate students at a large southeastern public university. INTERVENTION: Intervention participants were encouraged through e-mails, website instructions, and moderator communications to solicit and provide social support related to increasing physical activity through a physical activity-themed Facebook group. Participants received access to a dedicated website with educational materials and a physical activity self-monitoring tool. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was perceived social support for physical activity; secondary outcomes included self-reported physical activity. RESULTS: Participants experienced increases in social support and physical activity over time but there were no differences in perceived social support or physical activity between groups over time. Facebook participants posted 259 times to the group. Two thirds (66%) of intervention participants completing a post-study survey indicated that they would recommend the program to friends. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an online social networking group plus self-monitoring did not produce greater perceptions of social support or physical activity as compared to education-only controls. Given their promising features and potential reach, efforts to further understand how online social networks can be used in health promotion should be pursued.

2138,"Contributions of HIV, hepatitis C virus, and traditional vascular risk factors to peripheral artery disease in women OBJECTIVES: HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it is unclear whether HIV and HCV are also associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We examined the association of HIV, HCV, and traditional CVD risk factors with PAD in the Women's Interagency HIV Study, a multicenter US cohort. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, ankle-brachial index was estimated using Doppler ultrasound and manual sphygmomanometer in 1899 participants aged more than 40 years with HIV/HCV coinfection, HCV or HIV monoinfection, or neither infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of PAD (ankle-brachial index _0.9) after controlling for demographic, behavioral, and CVD risk factors. RESULTS: Over two-thirds were African-American, median age was 50 years, and PAD prevalence was 7.7% with little difference by infection status. After multivariable adjustment, neither HIV nor HCV infection was associated with greater odds of PAD. Factors associated with PAD included older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01 for age 61-70 vs. 40-50 years; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 3.87], Black race (aOR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.15, 4.63), smoking (aOR: 1.27 per 10-pack-year increment; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.48), and higher SBP (aOR: 1.14 per 10__mHg; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.28). CONCLUSION: The high PAD prevalence in this nationally representative cohort of women with or at risk for HIV is on par with general population studies in individuals a decade older than our study's median age. HIV and HCV infection are not associated with greater PAD risk relative to uninfected women with similar risk factors. Modifiable traditional CVD risk factors may be important early intervention targets in women with and at risk for HIV.",,,3,,,
2139,"Etiological overlap between obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia nervosa: a longitudinal cohort, multigenerational family and twin study Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often co-occurs with anorexia nervosa (AN), a comorbid profile that complicates the clinical management of both conditions. This population-based study aimed to examine patterns of comorbidity, longitudinal risks, shared familial risks and shared genetic factors between OCD and AN at the population level. Participants were individuals with a diagnosis of OCD (N=19,814) or AN (N=8,462) in the Swedish National Patient Register between January 1992 and December 2009; their first-, second- and third-degree relatives; and population-matched (1:10 ratio) unaffected comparison individuals and their relatives. Female twins from the population-based Swedish Twin Register (N=8,550) were also included. Females with OCD had a 16-fold increased risk of having a comorbid diagnosis of AN, whereas males with OCD had a 37-fold increased risk. Longitudinal analyses showed that individuals first diagnosed with OCD had an increased risk for a later diagnosis of AN (risk ratio, RR=3.6), whereas individuals first diagnosed with AN had an even greater risk for a later diagnosis of OCD (RR=9.6). These longitudinal risks were about twice as high for males than for females. First- and second-degree relatives of probands with OCD had an increased risk for AN, and the magnitude of this risk tended to increase with the degree of genetic relatedness. Bivariate twin models revealed a moderate but significant degree of genetic overlap between self-reported OCD and AN diagnoses (ra =0.52, 95% CI: 0.26-0.81), but most of the genetic variance was disorder-specific. The moderately high genetic correlation supports the idea that this frequently observed comorbid pattern is at least in part due to shared genetic factors, though disorder-specific factors are more important. These results have implications for current gene-searching efforts and for clinical practice. _ 2015 World Psychiatric Association.",,,1,,,
2140,"The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) developed and tested its first wave of adult self-reported health outcome item banks: 2005-2008 OBJECTIVES: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are essential when evaluating many new treatments in health care; yet, current measures have been limited by a lack of precision, standardization, and comparability of scores across studies and diseases. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) provides item banks that offer the potential for efficient (minimizes item number without compromising reliability), flexible (enables optional use of interchangeable items), and precise (has minimal error in estimate) measurement of commonly studied PROs. We report results from the first large-scale testing of PROMIS items. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Fourteen item pools were tested in the U.S. general population and clinical groups using an online panel and clinic recruitment. A scale-setting subsample was created reflecting demographics proportional to the 2000 U.S. census. RESULTS: Using item-response theory (graded response model), 11 item banks were calibrated on a sample of 21,133, measuring components of self-reported physical, mental, and social health, along with a 10-item Global Health Scale. Short forms from each bank were developed and compared with the overall bank and with other well-validated and widely accepted (""legacy"") measures. All item banks demonstrated good reliability across most of the score distributions. Construct validity was supported by moderate to strong correlations with legacy measures. CONCLUSION: PROMIS item banks and their short forms provide evidence that they are reliable and precise measures of generic symptoms and functional reports comparable to legacy instruments. Further testing will continue to validate and test PROMIS items and banks in diverse clinical populations. Copyright _ 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
2141,"Correlates of Successful Aging in Racial and Ethnic Minority Women Age 80 Years and Older: Findings from the Women's Health Initiative BACKGROUND: Most research has focused on definitions and predictors of successful aging. However, racial/ethnic minorities are often under represented in this research. Given that the U.S. population is aging and becoming more racially diverse, we examined correlates of ""successful aging,"" as defined by physical functioning and overall quality of life (QOL), among racial/ethnic minority women aged 80 years and older in the Women's Health Initiative. METHODS: Participants included 1,924 racial/ethnic minority women (African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanic/Latinos, and American Indian/Alaskan Natives) 80 years of age and older who are enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative and have physical functioning data after turning 80 years of age. Analysis of covariance was used to examine between and within group differences in physical functioning and selfrated overall QOL for African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic/Latinos. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in physical functioning between racial/ethnic minority groups in adjusted analyses. However, overall QOL was significantly different between racial/ethnic minority groups. Age, recreational physical activity, and overall selfrated health were independent correlates of physical functioning across racial/ethnic minority groups, whereas overall selfrated health was the only consistent correlate of overall QOL across the minority groups for the within minority group comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Between racial/ethnic minority group differences in physical functioning are largely explained by demographic, psychosocial, behavioral, and health-related variables. We found statistically significant differences in selfrated overall QOL between racial/ethnic minority groups. _ The Author 2016.

2142,"A multicomponent quality improvement intervention to improve blood pressure and reduce racial disparities in rural primary care practices The Southeastern United States has the highest prevalence of hypertension and African Americans have disproportionately worse blood pressure control. The authors sought to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent practice-based quality improvement intervention on lowering mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 12 and 24_months compared with baseline among 525 patients, and to assess for a differential effect of the intervention by race (African Americans vs white). At 12_months, both African Americans (-5.0_mm Hg) and whites (-7.8_mm Hg) had a significant decrease in mean SBP compared with baseline, with no significant between-group difference. Similarly, at 24_months, mean SBP decreased in both African Americans (-6.0_mm Hg) and whites (-7.2_mm Hg), with no significant difference between groups. Notably, no significant racial disparity in mean SBP at baseline was shown. The intervention was effective in lowering mean SBP in both African Americans and whites but there was no differential effect of the intervention by race. _2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,
2143,"Implementation of the power to prevent diabetes prevention educational curriculum into rural African American communities: a feasibility study PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the feasibility of using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to implement the Power to Prevent (P2P) diabetes prevention education curriculum in rural African American (AA) settings. METHODS: Trained community health workers facilitated the 12-session P2P curriculum across 3 community settings. Quantitative (based on the pre- and post-curriculum questionnaires and changes in blood glucose, blood pressure [BP], and weight at baseline and 6 months) and qualitative data (based on semi-structured interviews with facilitators) were collected. Indicators of feasibility included: demand, acceptability, implementation fidelity, and limited efficacy testing. RESULTS: Across 3 counties, 104 AA participants were recruited; 43% completed _ 75% of the sessions. There was great demand for the program. Fifteen community health ambassadors (CHAs) were trained, and 4 served as curriculum facilitators. Content and structure of the intervention was acceptable to facilitators but there were challenges to implementing the program as designed. Improvements were seen in diabetes knowledge and the impact of healthy eating and physical activity on diabetes prevention, but there were no significant changes in blood glucose, BP, or weight. CONCLUSION: While it is feasible to use a CBPR approach to recruit participants and implement the P2P curriculum in AA community settings, there are significant challenges that must be overcome.",,,4,,,
2144,"Family member accompaniment to routine medical visits is associated with better self-care in heart failure patients OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between frequency of family member accompaniment to medical visits and heart failure (HF) self-care maintenance and management and to determine whether associations are mediated through satisfaction with provider communication. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 150 HF patients seen in outpatient clinics. HF self-care maintenance and management were assessed using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index. Satisfaction with provider communication was assessed using a single question originally included in the American Board of Internal Medicine Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. Frequency of family member accompaniment to visits was assessed using a single-item question. We performed regression analyses to examine associations between frequency of accompaniment and outcomes. Mediation analysis was conducted using MacKinnon's criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 61% reported accompaniment by family members to some/most/every visit. Accompaniment to some/most/every visit was associated with higher self-care maintenance (_ = 6.4, SE 2.5; p = 0.01) and management (_ = 12.7, SE 4.9; p = 0.01) scores. Satisfaction with provider communication may mediate the association between greater frequency of accompaniment to visits and self-care maintenance (1.092; p = 0.06) and self-care management (1.428; p = 0.13). DISCUSSION: Accompaniment to medical visits is associated with better HF self-care maintenance and management, and this effect may be mediated through satisfaction with provider communication. _ The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",,,6,,,
2145,"Social isolation, vital exhaustion, and incident heart failure: findings from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study AIMS: Prospective studies have shown that social isolation (i.e. lack of social contacts) predicts incident coronary heart disease (CHD), but it is unclear whether it predicts incident heart failure (HF) and what factors might mediate this association. HF patients may be more susceptible to social isolation as they tend to be older and may have disrupted social relationships due to life course factors (e.g. retirement or bereavement). We prospectively examined whether individuals with higher vs. low social isolation have a higher incidence of HF and determined whether this association is mediated by vital exhaustion. METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated incident HF hospitalization or death among 14 348 participants from Visit 2 (1990-1992) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study using Cox proportional hazard models which were sequentially adjusted for age, race/study community, gender, current smoking, alcohol use, and co-morbidities. We conducted mediation analyses according to the Baron and Kenny method. After a median follow-up of 16.9 person-years, 1727 (13.0%) incident HF events occurred. The adjusted hazard of incident HF was greater for those in the higher vs. low social isolation risk group (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.35). Our data suggest that vital exhaustion strongly mediates the association between higher social isolation and incident HF (the percentage change in beta coefficient for higher vs. low social isolation groups after adjusting for vital exhaustion was 36%). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that greater social isolation is an independent risk factor for incident HF, and this association appears to be strongly mediated by vital exhaustion.",,,8,,,
2146,"Acute loss of apolipoprotein E triggers an autoimmune response that accelerates atherosclerosis Objective- Dyslipidemia is a component of the metabolic syndrome, an established risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and is also observed in various autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions. However, there are limited opportunities to study the impact of acquired dyslipidemia on cardiovascular and immune pathology. Approach and Results- We designed a model system that allows for the conversion to a state of acute hyperlipidemia in adult life, so that the consequences of such a transition could be observed, through conditionally deleting APOE (apolipoprotein E) in the adult mouse. The transition to hypercholesterolemia was accompanied by adaptive immune responses, including the expansion of T lymphocyte helper cell 1, T follicular helper cell, and T regulatory subsets and the formation of germinal centers. Unlike steady-state Apoe-/- mice, abrupt loss of APOE induced rapid production of antibodies recognizing rheumatoid disease autoantigens. Genetic ablation of the germinal center reduced both autoimmunity and atherosclerosis, indicating that the immune response that follows loss of APOE is independent of atherosclerosis but nevertheless promotes plaque development. Conclusions- Our findings suggest that immune activation in response to hyperlipidemia could contribute to a wide range of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, including atherosclerosis.",,,1,,,
2147,"Motor vehicle traffic-related pedestrian deaths - United States, 2001-2010 Motor vehicle traffic crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in the United States, resulting in 33,687 deaths in 2010. Pedestrian travel makes up 10.5% of all trips (i.e., any travel from one address to another) taken in the United States, and pedestrians represent 13% of all motor vehicle traffic-related deaths. To determine traffic-related pedestrian death rates by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and urbanization level, CDC analyzed 2001-2010 data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The results of that analysis indicated that the overall, annualized, age-adjusted traffic-related pedestrian death rate was 1.58 deaths per 100,000 population. Persons aged _75 years and those categorized as American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) had the highest death rates, and age group differences varied by race/ethnicity. The results suggest that the overall pedestrian death rate could increase with the aging and growing racial/ethnic diversity of the U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the number of persons aged _75 years will more than double, from approximately 18 million in 2011 (6% of the U.S. population) to 44 million in 2040 (12% of the population); minority racial/ethnic populations are projected to increase from 116 million in 2010 (37% of the population) to 186 million in 2040 (49% of the population).* Strategies to prevent pedestrian deaths should include consideration of the needs of older adults and cultural differences among racial/ethnic populations.",,,1,,,
2148,"The relationship between neighborhood poverty and alcohol use: estimation by marginal structural models BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the relationship of neighborhood disadvantage with alcohol use or misuse have often controlled for individual characteristics on the causal pathway, such as income-thus potentially underestimating the relationship between disadvantage and alcohol consumption. METHODS: We used data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study of 5115 adults aged 18-30 years at baseline and interviewed 7 times between 1985 and 2006. We estimated marginal structural models using inverse probability-of-treatment and censoring weights to assess the association between point-in-time/cumulative exposure to neighborhood poverty (proportion of census tract residents living in poverty) and alcohol use/binging, after accounting for time-dependent confounders including income, education, and occupation. RESULTS: The log-normal model was used to estimate treatment weights while accounting for highly-skewed continuous neighborhood poverty data. In the weighted model, a one-unit increase in neighborhood poverty at the prior examination was associated with a 86% increase in the odds of binging (OR = 1.86 [95% confidence interval = 1.14-3.03]); the estimate from a standard generalized-estimating-equations model controlling for baseline and time-varying covariates was 1.47 (0.96-2.25). The inverse probability-of-treatment and censoring weighted estimate of the relative increase in the number of weekly drinks in the past year associated with cumulative neighborhood poverty was 1.53 (1.02-2.27); the estimate from a standard model was 1.16 (0.83-1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative and point-in-time measures of neighborhood poverty are important predictors of alcohol consumption. Estimators that more closely approximate a causal effect of neighborhood poverty on alcohol provided a stronger estimate than estimators from traditional regression models.",,,1,,,
2149,"Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for diffuse large B cell lymphoma Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma subtype and is clinically aggressive. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for DLBCL, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3 new genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 1 previous scan, totaling 3,857 cases and 7,666 controls of European ancestry, with additional genotyping of 9 promising SNPs in 1,359 cases and 4,557 controls. In our multi-stage analysis, five independent SNPs in four loci achieved genome-wide significance marked by rs116446171 at 6p25.3 (EXOC2; P = 2.33 _ 10(-21)), rs2523607 at 6p21.33 (HLA-B; P = 2.40 _ 10(-10)), rs79480871 at 2p23.3 (NCOA1; P = 4.23 _ 10(-8)) and two independent SNPs, rs13255292 and rs4733601, at 8q24.21 (PVT1; P = 9.98 _ 10(-13) and 3.63 _ 10(-11), respectively).

2150,"Patient-provider communication about pregnancy and HIV among female sex workers living with HIV in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic BACKGROUND: Health providers can play an important role in communication about pregnancy, particularly for women at increased risk for pregnancy complications, including female sex workers (FSWs) living with HIV. This study explored factors related to patient-provider communication about pregnancy among 253 FSWs living with HIV of reproductive age in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was employed including structured socio-behavioral surveys. Data were analyzed utilizing bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 253 FSWs living with HIV in this study, 95.7% had been pregnant at least once (median: 4; IQR: 3,6), 28.0% wanted more children and 36% reported a pregnancy after HIV diagnosis. Over half of participants (58.0%) reported having ever spoken to a health provider about pregnancy while living with HIV. Multivariate logistic regression found significant associations between having spoken to a health provider about HIV in pregnancy and a more positive perception of their provider (AOR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.5) and years since HIV diagnosis (AOR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.1). Participants were less likely to speak with a provider if they had a history of drug use (AOR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.9) or current alcohol use (AOR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9). CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the importance of non-judgmental and tailored provider-initiated conversations surrounding pregnancy. Future research is needed to better understand how and when pregnancy communication is initiated, as well as the content of clinical care conversations, to address the reproductive health of FSWs living with HIV.",,,6,,,

2152,"Health outcomes among HIV-positive Latinos initiating antiretroviral therapy in North America versus Central and South America INTRODUCTION: Latinos living with HIV in the Americas share a common ethnic and cultural heritage. In North America, Latinos have a relatively high rate of new HIV infections but lower rates of engagement at all stages of the care continuum, whereas in Latin America antiretroviral therapy (ART) services continue to expand to meet treatment needs. In this analysis, we compare HIV treatment outcomes between Latinos receiving ART in North America versus Latin America. METHODS: HIV-positive adults initiating ART at Caribbean, Central and South America Network for HIV (CCASAnet) sites were compared to Latino patients (based on country of origin or ethnic identity) starting treatment at North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) sites in the United States and Canada between 2000 and 2011. Cox proportional hazards models compared mortality, treatment interruption, antiretroviral regimen change, virologic failure and loss to follow-up between cohorts. RESULTS: The study included 8400 CCASAnet and 2786 NA-ACCORD patients initiating ART. CCASAnet patients were younger (median 35 vs. 37 years), more likely to be female (27% vs. 20%) and had lower nadir CD4 count (median 148 vs. 195 cells/_L, p< 0.001 for all). In multivariable analyses, CCASAnet patients had a higher risk of mortality after ART initiation (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.32 to 1.96), particularly during the first year, but a lower hazard of treatment interruption (AHR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.50), change to second-line ART (AHR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.62) and virologic failure (AHR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-positive Latinos initiating ART in Latin America have greater continuity of treatment but are at higher risk of death than Latinos in North America. Factors underlying these differences, such as HIV testing, linkage and access to care, warrant further investigation.",,,5,,,
2153,"Joint associations of insomnia and sleep duration with prevalent diabetes: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) BACKGROUND: Inadequate sleep quantity and quality are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. This relationship is not well-examined in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos, and prior analyses may be confounded by sleep apnea. This cross-sectional study examined joint associations of sleep duration and insomnia with diabetes among diverse U.S. Hispanic/Latinos. METHODS: Baseline data on sleep quantity and quality were obtained from 15,227 participants (mean age 41; range 18-74 years) from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Complex survey multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associations between prevalent diabetes and six phenotypes defined by cross-classifying sleep duration (short _6__, average >6-9__, long >9__) and insomnia, adjusting for sex, age, site and Hispanic/Latino background interaction, education, physical activity, diet quality, and sleep apnea. RESULTS: In the weighted population, 14% had diabetes, 28% had insomnia, 9% were short sleepers, and 19% were long sleepers. Compared with those with average sleep and no insomnia, those with short sleep and insomnia were more likely to have diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02, 2.11). Average sleepers with insomnia (1.28; 95% CI 1.02, 1.61) and long sleepers without insomnia (1.33; 95% CI 1.07, 1.65) also had elevated odds of diabetes. Further adjustment for body mass index attenuated associations, except with long sleep without insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Both decreased quantity and quality of sleep are associated with diabetes in Hispanic/Latinos, with the greatest odds among those with short sleep duration and insomnia. The association is largely explained by obesity. _ 2015 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",,,4,,,
2154,"Comparison of Self-Reported Sleep Duration With Actigraphy: Results From the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Sue_o Ancillary Study Most studies of sleep and health outcomes rely on self-reported sleep duration, although correlation with objective measures is poor. In this study, we defined sociodemographic and sleep characteristics associated with misreporting and assessed whether accounting for these factors better explains variation in objective sleep duration among 2,086 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos who completed more than 5 nights of wrist actigraphy and reported habitual bed/wake times from 2010 to 2013. Using linear regression, we examined self-report as a predictor of actigraphy-assessed sleep duration. Mean amount of time spent asleep was 7.85 (standard deviation, 1.12) hours by self-report and 6.74 (standard deviation, 1.02) hours by actigraphy; correlation between them was 0.43. For each additional hour of self-reported sleep, actigraphy time spent asleep increased by 20 minutes (95% confidence interval: 19, 22). Correlations between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent asleep were lower with male sex, younger age, sleep efficiency < 85%, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration _1.5 hours. Adding sociodemographic and sleep factors to self-reports increased the proportion of variance explained in actigraphy-assessed sleep slightly (18%-32%). In this large validation study including Hispanics/Latinos, we demonstrated a moderate correlation between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent asleep. The performance of self-reports varied by demographic and sleep measures but not by Hispanic subgroup. _ The Author 2016.

2155,"Maternal polycystic ovary syndrome and risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring: prenatal androgen exposure or genetic confounding? BACKGROUND: Maternal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been proposed as a model for investigating the role of prenatal androgen exposure in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, women with PCOS are at higher risk of developing psychiatric conditions and previous studies are likely confounded by genetic influences. METHODS: A Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study was conducted to disentangle the influence of prenatal androgen exposure from familial confounding in the association between maternal PCOS and offspring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and Tourette's disorder and chronic tic disorders (TD/CTD). PCOS-exposed offspring (n = 21 280) were compared with unrelated PCOS-unexposed offspring (n = 200 816) and PCOS-unexposed cousins (n = 17 295). Associations were estimated with stratified Cox regression models. RESULTS: PCOS-exposed offspring had increased risk of being diagnosed with ADHD, ASD, and TD/CTD compared with unrelated PCOS-unexposed offspring. Associations were stronger in girls for ADHD and ASD but not TD/CTD [ADHD: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.99), ASD: aHR = 2.02 (95% CI 1.45-2.82)] than boys [ADHD: aHR = 1.37 (95% CI 1.19-1.57), ASD: aHR = 1.46 (95% CI 1.21-1.76)]. For ADHD and ASD, aHRs for girls were stronger when compared with PCOS-unexposed cousins, but slightly attenuated for boys. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates were similar when accounting for familial confounding (i.e. genetics and environmental factors shared by cousins) and stronger in girls for ADHD and ASD, potentially indicating a differential influence of prenatal androgen exposure v. genetic factors. These results strengthen evidence for a potential causal influence of prenatal androgen exposure on the development of male-predominant neuropsychiatric disorders in female offspring of women with PCOS.",,,3,,,
2156,"Maternal oral bacterial levels predict early childhood caries development OBJECTIVE: To calculate the association of maternal salivary bacterial challenge (mutans streptococci [MS] and lactobacilli [LB]) from pregnancy through 24 months' postpartum with child caries incidence (_1 cavitated or restored teeth) at 36 months. MATERIALS & METHODS: Dental, salivary bacterial, sociodemographic, and behavioral measures were collected at three- to six-month intervals from a birth cohort of low-income Hispanic mother-child dyads (N = 243). We calculated the relative child caries incidence, adjusted for confounding, following higher maternal challenge of MS (>4500 colony-forming units per milliliter of saliva [CFU/mL]) and LB (>50 CFU/mL) based on multivariable models. RESULTS: Salivary MS and LB levels were greater among mothers of caries-affected children versus caries-free children. Mothers with higher salivary MS challenge were more likely to have MS-positive children (>0 CFU/mL), but maternal LB challenge was not a statistically significant predictor of child LB-positive status. Adjusting for sociodemographics, feeding and care practices, and maternal dental status, higher maternal salivary challenge of both MS and LB over the study period predicted nearly double the child caries incidence versus lower MS and LB (cumulative incidence ratio: 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 3.8). CONCLUSION: Maternal salivary bacterial challenge not only is associated with oral infection among children but also predicts increased early childhood caries occurrence.",,,6,,,

2158,"Genome-wide association study identifies loci influencing concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma Concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma are widely used as indicators of liver disease. We carried out a genome-wide association study in 61,089 individuals, identifying 42 loci associated with concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma, of which 32 are new associations (P = 10(-8) to P = 10(-190)). We used functional genomic approaches including metabonomic profiling and gene expression analyses to identify probable candidate genes at these regions. We identified 69 candidate genes, including genes involved in biliary transport (ATP8B1 and ABCB11), glucose, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (FADS1, FADS2, GCKR, JMJD1C, HNF1A, MLXIPL, PNPLA3, PPP1R3B, SLC2A2 and TRIB1), glycoprotein biosynthesis and cell surface glycobiology (ABO, ASGR1, FUT2, GPLD1 and ST3GAL4), inflammation and immunity (CD276, CDH6, GCKR, HNF1A, HPR, ITGA1, RORA and STAT4) and glutathione metabolism (GSTT1, GSTT2 and GGT), as well as several genes of uncertain or unknown function (including ABHD12, EFHD1, EFNA1, EPHA2, MICAL3 and ZNF827). Our results provide new insight into genetic mechanisms and pathways influencing markers of liver function.",,,8,,,
2159,"Multidimensional profiles of health locus of control in Hispanic Americans Latent profile analysis identified health locus of control profiles among 436 Hispanic Americans who completed the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scales. Results revealed four profiles: Internally Oriented-Weak, -Moderate, -Strong, and Externally Oriented. The profile groups were compared on sociocultural and demographic characteristics, health beliefs and behaviors, and physical and mental health outcomes. The Internally Oriented-Strong group had less cancer fatalism, religiosity, and equity health attributions, and more alcohol consumption than the other three groups; the Externally Oriented group had stronger equity health attributions and less alcohol consumption. Deriving multidimensional health locus of control profiles through latent profile analysis allows examination of the relationships of health locus of control subtypes to health variables. _ The Author(s) 2015.",,,1,,,

2161,"Stewardship of quality of care in health systems: Core functions, common pitfalls, and potential solutions National Ministries of Health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a key role to play as stewards of the quality agenda in their health systems. This paper uses a previously developed six-point framework for stewardship (strategy formulation, intersectoral collaboration, governance and accountability, health system design, policy and regulation, and intelligence generation) and identifies specific examples of activities in LMICs in each of these domains, pitfalls to avoid, and possible solutions to these pitfalls. Many LMICs now have quality strategies with clear vision statements. There are good examples of quality agencies and donor collaboration councils to coordinate activities across different sectors. There are multiple options for accountability, including public reporting, community accountability structures, results-based payment, accreditation, and inspection. To improve health system design, available tools include decision support tools, task-shifting models, supply chain management, and programs to train quality improvement staff. Policy options include legislation on disclosure of adverse events, and regulations to ensure skills of health care providers. Lastly, health information tools include patient registries, facility surveys, hospital discharge abstracts, standardized population and patient surveys, and dedicated agencies for reporting on quality. Policy-makers can use this article to identify options for driving the quality agenda and address anticipated implementation barriers.",,,2,,,
2162,"Maternal influences on nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy Symptoms of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy (NVP) are common among pregnant women, but whether some women are more likely than others to experience these symptoms has not been well established. We examined potential risk factors for NVP symptom severity, timing of onset, and duration. We included 2,407 newly pregnant women who participated in a prospective cohort study on early pregnancy health between 2000 and 2004 in three U.S. cities. Data on NVP and other health information were collected through telephone interviews, early gestation ultrasound, and medical record abstractions. Generalized linear models were used to model possible risk factors for each NVP characteristic. Eighty-nine percent of women had NVP; for 99% of these, symptoms started in the first trimester. None of the characteristics examined were associated with having NVP. Among those with NVP, increasing risk of delayed symptoms onset was associated with advancing maternal age; increased risks were also seen among non-Hispanic Black [Risk ratio (RR) = 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6,11.6] and Hispanic women (RR = 2.3, 95% CI:0.4,11.5). NVP symptoms for multigravidae were more likely to last beyond the first trimester with each additional pregnancy. Most pregnant women experienced NVP. Nearly all of them, regardless of characteristics examined, had symptoms beginning in the first trimester. Maternal age, race/ethnicity, and gravidity were associated with delayed onset and symptoms that persisted into the second trimester.",,,3,,,
2163,"Association of housing stress with child maltreatment: A systematic review Child maltreatment is a significant public health issue in the United States. Understanding key risk factors for child maltreatment is critical to informing effective prevention. Poverty is an established risk factor for child maltreatment. However, recent research indicates that material hardship (i.e., difficulties meeting basic needs) may serve as a more direct measure of the way in which poverty affects daily life. One form of material hardship that is common among families is housing stress. Previous reviews have summarized the existing literature regarding the association of economic insecurity with child maltreatment, but no reviews have synthesized and critically evaluated the literature specific to the association of various types of housing stress with child maltreatment. We conducted a systematic search of multiple electronic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies conducted in the U.S. regarding the association of housing stress with child maltreatment. We identified 21 articles that used nine distinct measures of housing stress including homelessness or eviction, homeless or emergency shelter stays, foreclosure filing, housing instability, inadequate housing, physical housing risk, living doubled-up, housing unaffordability, and composite housing stress indicators. Overall, results from this body of literature indicate that housing stress is associated with an increased likelihood of caregiver or child self-reported maltreatment, child protective services (CPS) reports, investigated and substantiated CPS reports, out-of-home placements, and maltreatment death. Additional theory-driven research is needed to further our understanding of the contribution of specific types of housing stress to risk for specific types of maltreatment.",,,1,,,
2164,"Examining the Impact of a Psychosocial Syndemic on Past Six-Month HIV Screening Behavior of Black Men who have Sex with Men in the United States: Results from the POWER Study Syndemic production theory has been used to explore HIV transmission risk or infections but has not been used to investigate prevention behavior, or with large samples of non-Whites. This analysis is the first to explore the impact of syndemic factors on previous six-month HIV screening behavior among US Black MSM. Data from Promoting Our Worth, Equality and Resilience (POWER) were analyzed from 3294 participants using syndemic variable counts and measures of interaction/synergy. Syndemic variables included: past three-month poly-drug use, depression, last year intimate partner violence, HIV risk and problematic binge drinking. BMSM reporting two syndemic factors were more likely to report screening (AOR_=_1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.80; p_=_0.028) with no significant associations for three or more conditions. Measures of joint effect revealed that there were synergies among depression, problematic binge drinking and poly-drug use but these psychosocial factors cannot entirely explain testing patterns and excess disease burden among BMSM.",,,6,,,
2165,"Characterizing the HIV care continuum among a community sample of black men who have sex with men in the United States Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) have the highest HIV incidence rates among all men who have sex with men (MSM) and have been less likely than other MSM to be diagnosed, linked or retained in care for HIV. The Promoting Our Worth, Equality, and Resilience (POWER) study administered a behavioral health survey and HIV test to BMSM to estimate the HIV continuum of care among a community-derived sample. Of the N_=_1,680 BMSM living with HIV, n_=_956 (56.9%) were aware of their HIV-positive status. BMSM who had been previously diagnosed reported progression through the care continuum at greater than 80% for linkage to medical care (97.6%), retention in medical care (97.3%), prescription of antiretroviral therapy (93.6%) and viral suppression (86.4%). Results of this analysis reveal the urgent need to ensure BMSM are being screened and diagnosed. Additionally, community-driven samples are a promising method offering the opportunity to build on the resilience of BMSM progressing though the continuum as well as engage BMSM not yet in care. Lastly, such methods can assist in communicating with those lost to retention.",,,6,,,
2166,"Association between Vitamin D Genetic Risk Score and Cancer Risk in a Large Cohort of U.S. Women Some observational studies suggest an inverse association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and cancer incidence and mortality. We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis of the relationship between a vitamin D genetic risk score (GRS, range 0-10), comprised of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of vitamin D status in the DHCR7, CYP2R1 and GC genes and cancer risk among women. Analysis was performed in the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS), including 23,294 women of European ancestry who were cancer-free at baseline and followed for 20 years for incident cancer. In a subgroup of 1782 WGHS participants with 25OHD measures at baseline, the GRS was associated with circulating 25OHD mean (SD) = 67.8 (26.1) nmol/L, 56.9 (18.7) nmol/L in the lowest versus 73.2 (27.9) nmol/L in the highest quintile of the GRS (p trend < 0.0001 across quintiles). However, in age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, higher GRS (reflecting higher 25OHD levels) was not associated (cases; Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% Confidence Interval (CI)), p-value) with incident total cancer: (n = 3985; 1.01 (1.00-1.03), p = 0.17), breast (n = 1560; 1.02 (0.99-1.05), p = 0.21), colorectal (n = 329; 1.06 (1.00-1.13), p = 0.07), lung (n = 330; 1.00 (0.94-1.06), p = 0.89) or total cancer death (n = 770; 1.00 (0.96-1.04), p = 0.90). Results were similar in fully-adjusted models. A GRS for higher circulating 25OHD was not associated with cancer incidence or mortality.",,,3,,,
2167,"The Longitudinal Association between Social Support on HIV Medication Adherence and Healthcare Utilization in the Women's Interagency HIV Study Social support is associated with HIV-related health outcomes. However, few studies have explored this longitudinally. We assessed psychometric properties of the Medical Outcomes Study's Social Support Survey among women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study, and explored the longitudinal effects of social support on HIV medication adherence (HIV-positive women) and healthcare utilization (HIV-positive and negative women). The 15 questions loaded into two factors, with Cronbach's Alpha_>_0.95. Over 3_years, perceived emotional support was associated with optimal medication adherence (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.28) and healthcare utilization (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.27), and tangible social support with adherence only (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08-1.27) when controlling for covariates, including core sociodemographic characteristics and depressive symptoms.

2168,"Longitudinal associations between neighborhood factors and HIV care outcomes in the WIHS Identifying structural determinants affecting HIV outcomes is important for informing interventions across heterogeneous geographies. Longitudinal hierarchical generalized mixed-effects models were used to quantify the associations between changes in certain structural-level factors on HIV care engagement, medication adherence, and viral suppression. Among women living with HIV in the WIHS, ten-unit increases in census-tract level proportions of unemployment, poverty, and lack of car ownership were inversely associated with viral suppression and medication adherence, while educational attainment and owner-occupied housing were positively associated with both outcomes. Notably, increased residential stability (aOR 5.68, 95% CI 2.93, 9.04) was positively associated with HIV care engagement, as were unemployment (aOR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.57, 1.60), lack of car ownership (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13, 1.15), and female-headed households (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.22, 1.23). This underscores the importance of understanding neighborhood context, including factors that may not always be considered influential, in achieving optimal HIV-related outcomes.",,,6,,,
2169,"Characteristics and service use of medicare beneficiaries using federally qualified health centers BACKGROUND: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) provide primary care for millions of Americans, but little is known about Medicare beneficiaries who use FQHCs. OBJECTIVE: To compare patient characteristics and health care service use among Medicare beneficiaries stratified by FQHC use. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 2011 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. SUBJECTS: Subjects included beneficiaries with at least 1 evaluation and management (E&M) visit in 2011, categorized as FQHC users (_1 E&M visit to FQHCs) or nonusers living in the same primary care service areas as FQHC users. Users were subclassified as predominant if the majority of their E&M visits were to FQHCs. MEASURES: Demographic characteristics, physician visits, and inpatient care use. RESULTS: Most FQHC users (56.6%) were predominant users. Predominant and nonpredominant users, compared with nonusers, markedly differed by prevalence of multiple chronic conditions (18.2%, 31.7% vs. 22.7%) and annual mortality (2.8%, 3.8% vs. 4.0%; all P< 0.05). In adjusted analyses (reference: nonusers), predominant users had fewer physician visits (RR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.81-0.81) and fewer hospitalizations (RR=0.84; 95% CI, 0.84-0.85), whereas nonpredominant users had higher use of both types of service (RR=1.18, 95% CI, 1.18-1.18; RR=1.09, 95% CI, 1.08-1.10, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Even controlling for primary care delivery markets, nonpredominant FQHC users had a higher burden of chronic illness and service use than predominant FQHC users. It will be important to monitor Medicare beneficiaries using FQHCs to understand whether primary care only payment incentives for FQHCs could induce fragmented care.",,,6,,,
2170,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes defined by common translocations: utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a case-control study We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays to identify t(14;18) translocations in archival paraffin-embedded tumor sections from non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases enrolled in a population-based study. t(14;18) was identified in 54% of 152 cases, including 39% of diffuse large cell lymphomas (26 of 66 cases) and 84% of follicular lymphomas (36 of 43 cases). Eighty-seven percent of t(14;18)-positive cases and 57% of t(14;18)-negative cases expressed bcl-2. FISH assays detected twice as many t(14;18)-positive follicular lymphomas as PCR assays.

2171,"A case-control study of tobacco use and other non-occupational risk factors for lymphoma subtypes defined by t(14; 18) translocations and bcl-2 expression OBJECTIVE: We re-evaluated reported associations between tobacco use and other factors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) t(14; 18)-subtypes based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays believed to be more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction (PCR), previously used for detecting t(14; 18). METHODS: Commercial FISH assays and bcl-2 immunostaining were performed on paraffin sections to determine t(14; 18) and bcl-2 case-subtypes. Polytomous logistic regression models estimated associations between NHL case-subtypes (versus 1,245 population-based controls) and tobacco use as well as other factors. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, state, and proxy status, t(14; 18)-negative NHL was associated with any tobacco use (vs. no tobacco use, OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0-3.5), including current smoking (vs. no cigarette use, OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.2). Tobacco exposures were not clearly associated with t(14; 18)-positive NHL or bcl-2 case-subtypes. Hair-dye use and family history of a hemolymphatic cancer were associated with t(14; 18)-negative NHL, but the number of exposed cases was small. CONCLUSIONS: The association between t(14; 18)-negative NHL and cigarette smoking was unexpected given previous evidence of associations between smoking and follicular lymphoma (which is largely t(14; 18)-positive). Future studies characterizing additional molecular characteristics of t(14; 18)-negative NHL may help determine whether the association with smoking may have been causal versus an artifact of chance or bias.",,,3,,,
2172,"Effect of an educational intervention on HPV knowledge and vaccine attitudes among urban employed women and female undergraduate students in China: a cross-sectional study BACKGROUND: Due to the potential of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for decreasing cervical cancer rates in Mainland China, where some of the highest incidences in the world have been reported, our study aimed to assess HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge, and to evaluate the effect of a brief educational intervention on HPV knowledge and vaccine acceptability in Chinese undergraduate students and employed women. METHODS: This multi-center, cross-sectional study was conducted across five representative cities of the five main geographical regions of Mainland China. Participants were selected from one comprehensive university and three to four companies in each city for a total of six comprehensive universities and 16 companies. A 62-item questionnaire on HPV knowledge and HPV vaccine acceptability was administered to participants before and after an educational intervention. The intervention consisted of an informative group lecture. RESULTS: A total of 1146 employed women and 557 female undergraduate students were surveyed between August and November 2011. Baseline HPV knowledge was low among both groups--320/1146 (28%) of employed women and 66/557 (12%) of students had heard of HPV, while only 237/1146 (21%) of employed women and 40/557 (7.2%) of students knew that HPV is related to cervical cancer. After educational instruction, 947/1061 (89%) of employed women and 193/325 (59%) of students knew the relationship between HPV and cervical cancer (_2 = 1041.8, p < 0.001 and _2 = 278.5, p < 0.001, respectively). Post-intervention, vaccine acceptability increased from 881/1146 (77%) to 953/1061 (90%), (p = < 0.001) in employed women and 405/557 (73%) in students to 266/325 (82%), (p < 0.001). Women in both groups cited concerns about the HPV vaccine's safety, efficacy, and limited use to date as reasons for being unwilling to receive vaccination. 502/1146 (44%) of women were willing to vaccinate their children at baseline, which increased to 857/1061 (81%) post-intervention, p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of our lecture-based education initiative into a government-sponsored or school-based program may improve HPV-related knowledge and HPV vaccine acceptability. Further studies are needed to evaluate and standardize HPV education programs in China.",,,0,,,
2173,"Who Stays and Who Goes: Predictors of Admission among Patients Presenting with Febrile Illness and a Positive Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test in a Rural Ugandan Health Center Not much is known about clinical decision-making in rural, low-resource settings regarding fever, a common reason for presentation to care. In this prospective cohort study of patients presenting with febrile illness to a rural Ugandan health center, we examined demographic and clinical factors predictive of an initial disposition of inpatient admission after clinical evaluation, but before laboratory testing. We then assessed the association of laboratory results and system factors with a change between initial and final disposition plans. Four thousand nine hundred twenty-four patients with suspected febrile illness were included in the primary analysis. The strongest predictors for an initial disposition of admission after clinical examination were impaired consciousness (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 3.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.44-4.21) and fever on examination (aRR, 2.27; 95% CI: 1.79-2.87). Providers initially planned to discharge patients with significant vital sign abnormalities, including tachypnea (3.6%) and hypotension (1.3%). Anemia strongly predicted a final disposition of admission after an initial disposition of discharge (aRR, 48.34; 95% CI: 24.22-96.49); other laboratory abnormalities, including hypoglycemia and acidosis, did not change disposition planning. In those with an initial disposition of admission, living farther than the two neighboring villages was associated with a final disposition of discharge (aRR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.10-4.12). A concerning number of patients with abnormal vital signs and laboratory results were not admitted for inpatient care. Geographic factors may influence a patient's final disposition contrary to a provider's initial disposition plan. Future work should assess longer term outcomes after discharge and a broader study population.",,,5,,,

2175,"Direct and indirect effects of neighborhood characteristics on the perpetration of dating violence across adolescence Neighborhood context plays a role in the development of adolescent health risk behaviors, but few studies have investigated the influence of neighborhoods on the perpetration of dating violence. This longitudinal study examined the direct effects of risky neighborhood structural and physical characteristics on trajectories of the perpetration of dating violence, tested whether collective efficacy mediated these relationships, and determined if the effects varied by the sex of the adolescent. Adolescent data are from a multi-wave longitudinal study from grades 8 to 12; neighborhood data were collected from parents' interviews and U.S. Census data. Multilevel growth curve models were conducted with 3,218 students; the sample was 50% male, 41% White, 50% Black, and 9% other race/ethnicity. In models examining risky neighborhood variables one at a time, and controlling for potential individual-level confounders, the sex of the adolescent interacted with economic disadvantage, residential instability, and physical disorder; these risky neighborhood characteristics increased risk for girls' but not boys' perpetrating of dating violence. In full models with all of the risky neighborhood variables, the sex of the adolescent continued to interact with neighborhood economic disadvantage; living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods increased girls' but not boys' risk for dating violence across all ages. No other risky neighborhood effects were found for boys or girls. Collective efficacy did not mediate the relationships between other neighborhood characteristics and the outcome. These findings suggest that dating violence prevention strategies for girls should consider the contexts in which they live rather than only targeting changes in their individual characteristics.",,,1,,,
2176,"Validation of PIN 3 physical activity survey in low-income overweight and obese young mothers BACKGROUND: Existing physical activity surveys have not been validated for use with low-income overweight and obese young mothers. This study aimed to validate the Pregnancy Infection and Nutrition 3 (PIN3) physical activity survey and to explore whether its validity varied by race/ethnicity and body mass index (BMI) category when including or excluding child and adult care activities in the target population. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and were asked to fill out the PIN3 survey and wear an Actigraph accelerometer. Validity was assessed (N_=_42) using Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Regardless of inclusion or exclusion of child and adult care activity, the PIN3 survey showed evidence of validity for moderate (correlation coefficients 0.33 [p_=_0.03]; 0.40 [p_=_0.08]) but not vigorous (-0.01 [p_=_0.91]; -0.06 [p_=_0.69]) physical activity. The mean minutes per week spent in moderate, vigorous and moderate-vigorous physical activity measured by the PIN3 were substantially higher than when measured by accelerometer, for example, 588 (PIN3) versus 148 (accelerometer) minutes per week. Also, correlations between self-reported and objective monitored activity varied substantially by race/ethnicity and BMI category, for example, 0.29 (p_=_0.18) for overweight women versus 0.57 (p_=_0.007) for obese women; 0.27 (p_=_0.20) for African American versus 0.66 (p_=_0.001) for white. CONCLUSIONS: The PIN3 survey may be adequate for many applications where quick and practical assessments are needed for moderate physical activity data in low-income overweight and obese young mothers. The substantial differences in mean minutes per week between the PIN3 and accelerometer may be due to over-reported physical activity by the study participants.

2177,"Incidence and survival of hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure in four US communities (from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study) Most population-based estimates of incident hospitalized heart failure (HF) have not differentiated acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) from chronic stable HF nor included racially diverse populations. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study conducted surveillance of hospitalized HF events (age _55 years) in 4 US communities. We estimated hospitalized ADHF incidence and survival by race and gender. Potential 2005 to 2009 HF hospitalizations were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes; 6,168 records were reviewed to validate ADHF cases. Population estimates were derived from US Census data; 50% of eligible hospitalizations were classified as ADHF, of which 63.6% were incident ADHF and 36.4% were recurrent ADHF. The average incidence of hospitalized ADHF was 11.6 per 1,000 persons, aged _55 years, per year, and recurrent hospitalized ADHF was 6.6 per 1,000 persons/yr. Age-adjusted annual ADHF incidence was highest for black men (15.7 per 1,000), followed by black women (13.3 per 1,000), white men (12.3 per 1,000), and white women (9.9 per 1,000). Of incident ADHF events with heart function assessment (89%), 53% had reduced the ejection fraction (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]) and 47% had preserved ejection fraction (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). Black men had the highest proportion of acute HFrEF events (70%); white women had the highest proportion of acute HFpEF (59%). Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality after an incident ADHF was 10.4% and 29.5%, respectively. Survival did not differ by race or gender. In conclusion, ADHF hospitalization and HF type varied by both race and gender, but case fatality rates did not. Further studies are needed to explain why black men are at higher risk of hospitalized ADHF and HFrEF. Copyright _ 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,9,,,
2178,"Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005-2014): ARIC Study Community Surveillance BACKGROUND: Community trends of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex. METHODS: The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (_55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40_173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746). RESULTS: Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. Average age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were _10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types. Only blacks showed decreased 1-year mortality over time (average annual percentage change: black women -5.4%, black men -4.6%), with rates differing by HF type (average annual percentage change: black women HFpEF -7.1%, black men HF with reduced ejection fraction -4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Between 2005 and 2014, trends in ADHF hospitalizations increased in 4 US communities, primarily driven by acute HFpEF. Survival at 1 year was poor regardless of EF but improved over time for black women and black men. _ 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,3,,,
2179,"Molecular variation at the SLC6A3 locus predicts lifetime risk of PTSD in the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study Recent work suggests that the 9-repeat (9R) allele located in the 3'UTR VNTR of the SLC6A3 gene increases risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no study reporting this association to date has been based on population-based samples. Furthermore, no study of which we are aware has assessed the joint action of genetic and DNA methylation variation at SLC6A3 on risk of PTSD. In this study, we assessed whether molecular variation at SLC6A3 locus influences risk of PTSD. Participants (n_=_320; 62 cases/258 controls) were drawn from an urban, community-based sample of predominantly African American Detroit adult residents, and included those who had completed a baseline telephone survey, had provided blood specimens, and had a homozygous genotype for either the 9R or 10R allele or a heterozygous 9R/10R genotype. The influence of DNA methylation variation in the SLC6A3 promoter locus was also assessed in a subset of participants with available methylation data (n_=_83; 16 cases/67 controls). In the full analytic sample, 9R allele carriers had almost double the risk of lifetime PTSD compared to 10R/10R genotype carriers (OR_=_1.98, 95% CI_=_1.02-3.86), controlling for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, number of traumas, smoking, and lifetime depression. In the subsample of participants with available methylation data, a significant (p_=_0.008) interaction was observed whereby 9R allele carriers showed an increased risk of lifetime PTSD only in conjunction with high methylation in the SLC6A3 promoter locus, controlling for the same covariates. Our results confirm previous reports supporting a role for the 9R allele in increasing susceptibility to PTSD. They further extend these findings by providing preliminary evidence that a ""double hit"" model, including both a putatively reduced-function allele and high methylation in the promoter region, may more accurately capture molecular risk of PTSD at the SLC6A3 locus.",,,1,,,
2180,"Identifying research needs for improving health care Insights from systematic reviews can help new studies better meet the priorities and needs of patients and communities. However, systematic reviews unfortunately have not yet achieved this position to direct and guide new research studies. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Evidence-based Practice Center Program uses systematic reviews to identify gaps in current evidence and has developed a systematic process of prioritizing these gaps with stakeholder input into clearly defined ""future research needs."" Eight Evidence-based Practice Centers began to apply this effort in 2010 to various clinical and policy topics. Gaps that prevented systematic reviewers from answering central questions of the review may include insufficient studies on subpopulations, insufficient studies with appropriate comparators, lack of appropriate outcomes measured, and methods problems. Stakeholder panels, consisting of advocacy groups, patients, researchers, clinicians, funders, and policymakers, help refine the gaps through multiple conference calls and prioritization exercises. Each report highlights a focused set of 4 to 15 high-priority needs with an accompanying description of possible considerations for study design. Identification of high-priority research needs could potentially speed the development and implementation of high-priority, stakeholder-engaged research.",,,7,,,
2181,"Effect of cytomegalovirus infection on breastfeeding transmission of HIV and on the health of infants born to HIV-infected mothers BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be acquired in utero or postnatally through horizontal transmission and breastfeeding. The effect of postnatal CMV infection on postnatal HIV transmission is unknown. METHODS: The Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals and Nutrition study, conducted in Malawi, randomized 2369 mothers and their infants to three antiretroviral prophylaxis arms - mother (triple regimen), infant (nevirapine), or neither - for 28 weeks of breastfeeding, followed by weaning. Stored plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell specimens were available for 492 infants at 24 weeks and were tested with CMV PCR. Available samples from infants who were CMV PCR-positive at 24 weeks were also tested at birth (N_=_242), and from infants PCR-negative at 24 weeks were tested at 48 weeks (N_=_96). Cox proportional-hazards models were used to determine if CMV infection was associated with infant morbidity, mortality, or postnatal HIV acquisition. RESULTS: At 24 weeks of age, CMV DNA was detected in 345/492 infants (70.1%); the estimated congenital CMV infection rate was 2.3%, and the estimated rate of CMV infection at 48 weeks was 78.5%. CMV infection at 24 weeks was associated with subsequent HIV acquisition through breastfeeding or infant death between 24 and 48 weeks of age (hazard ratio 4.27, P_=_0.05). CONCLUSION: Most breastfed infants of HIV-infected mothers in this resource-limited setting are infected with CMV by 24 weeks of age. Early CMV infection may be a risk factor for subsequent infant HIV infection through breastfeeding, pointing to the need for comprehensive approaches in order to achieve elimination of breastfeeding transmission of HIV.",,,6,,,
2182,"Making a difference in medical trainees' attitudes toward Latino patients: A pilot study of an intervention to modify implicit and explicit attitudes Negative attitudes and discrimination against Latinos exist in the dominant U.S. culture and in healthcare systems, contributing to ongoing health disparities. This article provides findings of a pilot test of Yo Veo Salud (I See Health), an intervention designed to positively modify attitudes toward Latinos among medical trainees. The research question was: Compared to the comparison group, did the intervention group show lower levels of implicit bias against Latinos versus Whites, and higher levels of ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness? We used a sequential cohort, post-test design to evaluate Yo Veo Salud with a sample of 69 medical trainees. The intervention setting was an academic medical institution in a Southeastern U.S. state with a fast-growing Latino population. The intervention was delivered, and data were collected online, between July and December of 2014. Participants in the intervention group showed greater ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness, compared to the comparison group. The implicit measure assessed four attitudinal dimensions (pleasantness, responsibility, compliance, and safety). Comparisons between our intervention and comparison groups did not find any average differences in implicit anti-Latino bias between the groups. However, in a subset analysis of White participants, White participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly decreased level of implicit bias in terms of pleasantness. A dose response was also founded indicating that participants involved in more parts of the intervention showed more change on all measures. Our findings, while modest in size, provide proof of concept for Yo Veo Salud as a means for increasing ethno-cultural and physician empathy, and patient-centeredness among medical residents and decreasing implicit provider bias toward Latinos.

2183,"Do behavioural differences help to explain variations in HIV prevalence in adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa? OBJECTIVE: To compare adolescent risk factors for HIV infection in two countries with high adolescent HIV prevalence and two lower prevalence countries with the aim of identifying risk factors that may help explain differences in adolescent HIV prevalence. METHODS: Data were available from two nationally representative surveys (South Africa, Zimbabwe), two behavioural intervention trials (Tanzania, Zimbabwe) and one population-based cohort (Uganda). Data on variables known or postulated to be risk factors for HIV infection were compared. RESULTS: Few risk behaviours were markedly more common in the high HIV prevalence populations. Risk factors more common in high HIV prevalence settings were genital ulcers and discharge, and women were more likely to report older male partners. DISCUSSION: Age mixing may be an important determinate of HIV prevalence in adolescents. Potential reasons for the general lack of association between other adolescent risk factors and adolescent HIV prevalence include adult HIV prevalence, misreported behaviour, different survey methods and other unmeasured adolescent behaviours. If adult factors dominate adolescent HIV risk, it would help explain the failure of behavioural interventions targeted at adolescents and suggests future interventions should include adults.",,,6,,,
2184,"Epigenetic events determine tissue-specific toxicity of inhalational exposure to the genotoxic chemical 1,3-butadiene in male C57BL/6J mice 1,3-Butadiene (BD), a widely used industrial chemical and a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, is a known human carcinogen. Although genotoxicity is an established mechanism of the tumorigenicity of BD, epigenetic effects have also been observed in livers of mice exposed to the chemical. To better characterize the diverse molecular mechanisms of BD tumorigenicity, we evaluated genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects of BD exposure in mouse tissues that are target (lung and liver) and non-target (kidney) for BD-induced tumors. We hypothesized that epigenetic alterations may explain, at least in part, the tissue-specific differences in BD tumorigenicity in mice. We evaluated the level of N-7-(2,3,4-trihydroxybut-1-yl)guanine adducts and 1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol crosslinks, DNA methylation, and histone modifications in male C57BL/6 mice exposed to filtered air or 425 ppm of BD by inhalation (6__/day, 5 days/week) for 2 weeks. Although DNA damage was observed in all three tissues of BD-exposed mice, variation in epigenetic effects clearly existed between the kidneys, liver, and lungs. Epigenetic alterations indicative of genomic instability, including demethylation of repetitive DNA sequences and alterations in histone-lysine acetylation, were evident in the liver and lung tissues of BD-exposed mice. Changes in DNA methylation were insignificant in the kidneys of treated mice, whereas marks of condensed heterochromatin and transcriptional silencing (histone-lysine trimethylation) were increased. These modifications may represent a potential mechanistic explanation for the lack of tumorigenesis in the kidney. Our results indicate that differential tissue susceptibility to chemical-induced tumorigenesis may be attributed to tissue-specific epigenetic alterations.

2185,"Variation in DNA-Damage Responses to an Inhalational Carcinogen (1,3-Butadiene) in Relation to Strain-Specific Differences in Chromatin Accessibility and Gene Transcription Profiles in C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ Mice BACKGROUND: The damaging effects of exposure to environmental toxicants differentially affect genetically distinct individuals, but the mechanisms contributing to these differences are poorly understood. Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a ""compensation"" for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1937.",,,1,,,

Street-based sex workers had little to no knowledge of HIV and primarily used condoms when condom use was initiated by clients. Bar-based sex workers had HIV knowledge and reported regularly using condoms mainly with first-time clients. While sex workers perceived themselves to be at low risk for acquiring HIV, they were aware of other sexually transmitted infections (STI) and expressed a strong desire for free STI testing and treatment services.",,,6,,,
2188,"The role of self-efficacy and motivation to explain the effect of motivational interviewing time on changes in risky sexual behavior among people living with HIV: a mediation analysis Little is known about the amount of Motivational Interviewing (MI) needed to reduce risky sexual behavior among People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) or the roles self-efficacy and motivation to practice safer sex play. Among 183 PLWHA who received safer sex MI and were surveyed every 4 months over a 12 month period, we used hierarchical negative binomial regression models to examine the association between amount of counseling time and sexual risk behavior. We performed mediation analysis to evaluate whether changes in self-efficacy and motivation explained this association. This study found that as MI time and number of provided sessions increased, participants' sexual risk behavior decreased. The effect of MI time and number of sessions on sexual behavior was mediated by self-efficacy but not by motivation to practice safer sex.",,,6,,,
2189,"What works best for ensuring treatment adherence. Lessons from a social support program for people treated for tuberculosis in Ukraine BACKGROUND: Worldwide, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. Ukraine is one of 30 countries with the highest burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Global literature shows that social support (SS) is important in improving TB treatment adherence, reducing lost to follow up rates and improving treatment outcomes. There are several models of SS available, and the literature provides little information on what aspects of SS are most important to TB patients in improving their adherence. METHODS: We used qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews (IDI) with 21 TB patients and 15 SS providers and coordinators in Ukraine in August-September 2016 to understand how the SS program promoted treatment adherence among patients. We examined the aspects of outpatient TB treatment that made adherence particularly difficult for patients in at-risk groups and aspects of the SS programs that worked best for addressing those barriers. Interviews were transcribed and analysis was performed to derive emergent themes. RESULTS: Main barriers included side effects from medicine, the amount of time required daily for transportation and waiting in lines at the health facility, transportation expenses, risks of being identified when visiting a TB facility and lack of motivation to seek treatment. Features of the SS program most valued by patients were convenience of not having to visit facility and support provided by nurses. These two features directly addressed most of the barriers identified. The commitment and qualities of the nurses that provided the SS was an important element of the program. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study suggests that the SS program in Ukraine was successful in reducing treatment default among patients at high risk of default because it directly addressed most of the major barriers they faced to treatment adherence.",,,2,,,
2190,"Measuring wealth in rural communities: Lessons from the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial BACKGROUND: Poverty and human capital development are inextricably linked and therefore research on human capital typically incorporates measures of economic well-being. In the context of randomized trials of health interventions, for example, such measures are used to: 1) assess baseline balance; 2) estimate covariate-adjusted analyses; and 3) conduct subgroup analyses. Many factors characterize economic well-being, however, and analysts often generate summary measures such as indices of household socio-economic status or wealth. In this paper, a household wealth index is developed and tested for participants in the cluster-randomized Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in rural Zimbabwe. METHODS: Building on the approach used in the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS), we combined a set of housing characteristics, ownership of assets and agricultural resources into a wealth index using principal component analysis (PCA) on binary variables. The index was assessed for internal and external validity. Its sensitivity was examined considering an expanded set of variables and an alternative statistical approach of polychoric PCA. Correlation between indices was determined using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and agreement between quintiles using a linear weighted Kappa statistic. Using the 2015 ZDHS data, we constructed a separate index and applied the loadings resulting from that analysis to the SHINE study population, to compare the wealth distribution in the SHINE study with rural Zimbabwe. RESULTS: The derived indices using the different methods were highly correlated (r>0.9), and the wealth quintiles derived from the different indices had substantial to near perfect agreement (linear weighted Kappa>0.7). The indices were strongly associated with a range of assets and other wealth measures, indicating both internal and external validity. Households in SHINE were modestly wealthier than the overall population of households in rural Zimbabwe. CONCLUSION: The SHINE wealth index developed here is a valid and robust measure of wealth in the sample.",,,1,,,
2191,"Integration of genome-wide association studies with biological knowledge identifies six novel genes related to kidney function In conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS), analytical approaches leveraging biological information may further understanding of the pathophysiology of clinical traits. To discover novel associations with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function, we developed a strategy for integrating prior biological knowledge into the existing GWAS data for eGFR from the CKDGen Consortium. Our strategy focuses on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in genes that are connected by functional evidence, determined by literature mining and gene ontology (GO) hierarchies, to genes near previously validated eGFR associations. It then requires association thresholds consistent with multiple testing, and finally evaluates novel candidates by independent replication. Among the samples of European ancestry, we identified a genome-wide significant SNP in FBXL20 (P = 5.6 _ 10(-9)) in meta-analysis of all available data, and additional SNPs at the INHBC, LRP2, PLEKHA1, SLC3A2 and SLC7A6 genes meeting multiple-testing corrected significance for replication and overall P-values of 4.5 _ 10(-4)-2.2 _ 10(-7). Neither the novel PLEKHA1 nor FBXL20 associations, both further supported by association with eGFR among African Americans and with transcript abundance, would have been implicated by eGFR candidate gene approaches. LRP2, encoding the megalin receptor, was identified through connection with the previously known eGFR gene DAB2 and extends understanding of the megalin system in kidney function. These findings highlight integration of existing genome-wide association data with independent biological knowledge to uncover novel candidate eGFR associations, including candidates lacking known connections to kidney-specific pathways. The strategy may also be applicable to other clinical phenotypes, although more testing will be needed to assess its potential for discovery in general.",,,8,,,
2192,"Multivitamin, calcium and folic acid supplements and the risk of colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome BACKGROUND: People with a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutation have a substantially elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) but the modifiers of this risk are not well established. We investigated the association between dietary supplement intake and CRC risk for carriers. METHODS: This study included 1966 (56% female) carriers of an MMR gene mutation (719 MLH1, 931 MSH2, 211 MSH6 and 105 PMS2) who were recruited from the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand into the Colon Cancer Family Registry between 1997 and 2012. Information on lifestyle factors including supplement intake was collected at the time of recruitment. Using Cox proportional hazards regression weighted to correct for ascertainment bias, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between self-reported multivitamin, calcium and folic acid supplement intake and CRC risk. RESULTS: Of 744 carriers with CRC, 18%, 6% and 5% reported intake of multivitamin, calcium and folic acid supplements for at least 1 month, respectively, compared with 27%, 11% and 10% of 1222 carriers without CRC. After adjusting for identified confounding variables, a decreased CRC risk was associated with multivitam inintake for at least 3 years (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32-0.69) and calcium intake for at least 3 years(HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.74), compared with never users. There was no evidence of an association between folic acid supplement intake and CRC risk (P = 0.82). CONCLUSION: Intake of multivitamin and calcium supplements might be associated with a decreased risk of CRC for MMR gene mutation carriers. _ The Author 2016; all rights reserved.

2193,"WIC recipients in the retail environment: A qualitative study assessing customer experience and satisfaction BACKGROUND: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program is an important intervention for prevention and treatment of obesity and food insecurity, but participation has dropped among eligible populations from 2009 to 2015. Program satisfaction is integral to participant retention, and the retail experience is a vital component of program satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: This article applies behavioral economics principles to explore the retail experience of WIC participants and ways in which it may be improved. DESIGN: The authors designed and conducted semistructured interviews and focus groups with WIC participants. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: A convenience sample of WIC participants aged 18 years and older were recruited through WIC clinics in Texas, North Carolina, Oregon, and Illinois (n=55, 27 participants from four focus groups and 28 individual interviews). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CONDUCTED: Responses were analyzed qualitatively using principles of content analysis. RESULTS: Challenges in identifying WIC-allowable items throughout the store as well as perceived stigmatization during the checkout process were the chief complaints. Study participants described a learning curve in successful use of WIC in retail environments over time. Study participants also reported acceptance of restrictions, such as a requirement to purchase the least expensive brand. CONCLUSIONS: Dissatisfaction with the retail experience may lead to the underutilization of WIC benefits or program exit. Behavioral economics strategies that facilitate a better shopping experience, such as creating a section for WIC items in the store or improving in-store education, may improve the retail experience for WIC customers. Further research is needed to ensure such strategies are effective and do not contribute to stigma. Copyright _ 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We sought to determine whether predictors of vitamin D insufficiency vary by race/ethnicity in an ethnically diverse pregnancy cohort. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and patient characteristics were measured at first prenatal visit to prenatal clinics in south-eastern USA between 2009 and 2011 (n 504). Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95_% CI were estimated using multivariable regression to quantify predictors of vitamin D insufficiency, overall and by race/ethnicity. In race/ethnicity-stratified models, season was most associated with vitamin D insufficiency among non-Hispanic white women; PR for winter v. summer were 3_58 (95_% CI 1_64, 7_81) for non-Hispanic white, 1_52 (95_% CI 1_18, 1_95) for Hispanic and 1_14 (95_% CI 0_99, 1_30) for non-Hispanic black women.

2196,"Early prenatal vitamin D concentrations and social-emotional development in infants BACKGROUND: Many pregnant women in the United States have suboptimal vitamin D, but the impact on infant development is unclear. Moreover, no pregnancy-specific vitamin D recommendations have been widely accepted. AIMS: Given the ubiquitous expression of vitamin D receptors in the brain, we investigated the association between early prenatal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and children's social and emotional development in the Newborn Epigenetic Study, a prospective study of pregnancies from 2009 to 2011 in Durham, North Carolina. METHODS: We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in first or second trimester plasma samples and categorized 25(OH)D concentrations into quartiles. Covariates were derived from maternal questionnaires. Mothers completed the Infant Toddler Social-Emotional Development Assessment when children were 12-24 months of age. We used multivariable linear regression to evaluate associations between 25(OH)D and specific behavior scores, adjusted for season of blood draw, maternal age, education, parity, smoking, marital status, prepregnancy BMI, and infant gender. We investigated effect-measure modification by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Of the 218 mother-infant pairs with complete data, Black mothers had much lower 25(OH)D concentrations as compared to White and Hispanic mothers. After adjustment, lower prenatal 25(OH)D was associated with slightly higher (less favorable) Internalizing scores among White children, but lower (more favorable) Internalizing scores among Black and Hispanic children. Lower prenatal 25(OH)D also appears to be associated with higher (less favorable) dysregulation scores, though only among White and Hispanic children. CONCLUSIONS: Though imprecise, preliminary results warrant further investigation regarding a role for prenatal vitamin D on children's early social and emotional development.",,,2,,,
2197,"Past-month cannabis use among U.S. individuals from 2002-2015: An age-period-cohort analysis BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug among U.S. adolescents and adults, but little is known about factors that drive trends in cannabis use prevalence. To better understand drivers of these trends, we aimed to estimate age, period, and cohort effects on past-month cannabis use among U.S. individuals age 12 and older from 2002 to 2015. METHODS: We conducted an age-period-cohort analysis on past-month cannabis use among participants ages 12 and older using the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual cross-sectional nationally-representative survey of drug use. Additionally, we examined how age, period, and cohort effects differed across gender. Participants (n_=_779,799) self-reported cannabis patterns using a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI). RESULTS: Past-month cannabis use in this population increased from 6.0% in 2002 to 8.1% in 2015. Distinct age, period, and cohort effects were observed. Compared to participants ages 12-13, participants ages 18-21 (PR: 16.8, 95% CI: 15.6, 18.1) and 22-25 (PR: 13.2, 95% CI: 12.2, 14.4) had dramatically higher prevalence of past-month cannabis use. Compared to participants in 2002, participants in 2014 (PR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4) and 2014 (PR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4) had slightly higher prevalence of past-month cannabis use. Compared to the 1940s birth cohort, the 1950s birth cohort (PR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.5, 2.2) had a higher prevalence of past-month cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Past-month cannabis use is prevalent and increasing among U.S. adults. Distinct age, period, and cohort effects are at play, though age effects are strongest.

2198,"Patterns of colorectal cancer care in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in women and the third most common in men worldwide. In this study, we used MEDLINE to conduct a systematic review of existing literature published in English between 2000 and 2010 on patterns of colorectal cancer care. Specifically, this review examined 66 studies conducted in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand to assess patterns of initial care, post-diagnostic surveillance, and end-of-life care for colorectal cancer. The majority of studies in this review reported rates of initial care, and limited research examined either post-diagnostic surveillance or end-of-life care for colorectal cancer. Older colorectal cancer patients and individuals with comorbidities generally received less surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Patients with lower socioeconomic status were less likely to receive treatment, and variations in patterns of care were observed by patient demographic and clinical characteristics, geographical location, and hospital setting. However, there was wide variability in data collection and measures, health-care systems, patient populations, and population representativeness, making direct comparisons challenging. Future research and policy efforts should emphasize increased comparability of data systems, promote data standardization, and encourage collaboration between and within European cancer registries and administrative databases.",,,3,,,
2199,"Phosphatidylcholine supplementation in pregnant women consuming moderate-choline diets does not enhance infant cognitive function: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial BACKGROUND: Choline is essential for fetal brain development, and it is not known whether a typical American diet contains enough choline to ensure optimal brain development. OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine whether supplementing pregnant women with phosphatidylcholine (the main dietary source of choline) improves the cognitive abilities of their offspring. DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 140 pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive supplemental phosphatidylcholine (750 mg) or a placebo (corn oil) from 18 wk gestation through 90 d postpartum. Their infants (n = 99) were tested for short-term visuospatial memory, long-term episodic memory, language development, and global development at 10 and 12 mo of age. RESULTS: The women studied ate diets that delivered _360 mg choline/d in foods (_80% of the recommended intake for pregnant women, 65% of the recommended intake for lactating women). The phosphatidylcholine supplements were well tolerated. Groups did not differ significantly in global development, language development, short-term visuospatial memory, or long-term episodic memory. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphatidylcholine supplementation of pregnant women eating diets containing moderate amounts of choline did not enhance their infants' brain function. It is possible that a longer follow-up period would reveal late-emerging effects. Moreover, future studies should determine whether supplementing mothers eating diets much lower in choline content, such as those consumed in several low-income countries, would enhance infant brain development.",,,6,,,
2200,"Investigating racial disparities in use of NK1 receptor antagonists to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting among women with breast cancer Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a major concern for cancer patients and, if uncontrolled, can seriously compromise quality of life (QOL) and other treatment outcomes. Because of the expense of antiemetic medications used to prevent CINV (particularly oral medications filled through Medicare Part D), disparities in their use may exist. We used 2006-2012 SEER-Medicare data to evaluate the use of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (NK1s), a potent class of antiemetics, among black and white women initiating highly emetogenic chemotherapy for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. We used modified Poisson regression to assess the relationship between race and (1) any NK1 use, (2) oral NK1 (aprepitant) use, and (3) intravenous NK1 (fosaprepitant) use. We report adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95_% confidence intervals (CI). The study included 1130 women. We observed racial disparities in use of any NK1 (aRR: 0.68, 95_% CI 0.51-0.91) and in use of oral aprepitant specifically (aRR: 0.54, 95_% CI 0.35-0.83). We did not observe disparities in intravenous fosaprepitant use. After controlling for variables related to socioeconomic status, disparities in NK1 and aprepitant use were reduced but not eliminated. We found racial disparities in women's use of oral NK1s for the prevention of CINV. These disparities may be partly explained by racial differences in socioeconomic status, which may translate into differential ability to afford the medication.",,,3,,,
2201,"Examining racial variation in antiemetic use and post-chemotherapy health care utilization for nausea and vomiting among breast cancer patients PURPOSE: Racial minority cancer patients may experience underuse of antiemetic medications to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). In addition to its adverse implications for quality of life, antiemetic underuse may contribute to observed disparities in acute illness during chemotherapy. To understand the potential contribution of CINV prophylaxis to breast cancer disparities, we assessed racial variation in potent antiemetic use and post-chemotherapy utilization related to CINV and the relationship between the two. METHODS: We used SEER-Medicare data to evaluate the health care utilization in the 14_days following chemotherapy initiation among black and white women receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy for breast cancer. We used modified Poisson regression to assess the relationship between (1) race and CINV-related utilization and (2) NK1 use and CINV-related utilization, overall and stratified by race. We report adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95_% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study included 1130 women. Black women were 11_% less likely than white women to use neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (NK1s) for CINV prophylaxis (p_=_0.02); however, they experienced fewer CINV-related encounters following chemotherapy (unadjusted RR_=_0.63, 95_%CI_=_0.40-0.99; p_=_0.05). After adjustment for clinical covariates, estimates were similar but no longer statistically significant (p_=_0.07). Among white women, NK1 use was associated with increased CINV-related utilization (aRR NK1 users vs. non-users: 1.35, 95_% CI_=_1.07-1.69, p_=_0.01), likely resulting from unmeasured confounders. CONCLUSION: Black women were less likely to use NK1s- and CINV-related services.

We assessed racial disparities in early use of medications for common cancer symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia) and whether these potential disparities modify end-of-life care. METHODS: We used 2007 to 2012 SEER-Medicare data to evaluate use of supportive medications (opioid pain medications and nonopioid psychotropics, including antidepressants/anxiolytics and sleep aids) in the 90 days postdiagnosis among black and white women with stage IV breast cancer who died between 2007 and 2012. We used modified Poisson regression to assess the relationship between race and supportive treatment use and end-of-life care (hospice, intensive care unit, more than one emergency department visit or hospitalization 30 days before death, in-hospital death). RESULTS: The study included 752 white and 131 black women. We observed disparities in nonopioid psychotropic use between black and white women (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.74) but not in opioid pain medication use. There were also disparities in hospice use (aRR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99), intensive care unit admission or more than one emergency department visit or hospitalization 30 days before death (aRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.63), and risk of dying in the hospital (aRR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.09). Supportive medication use did not attenuate end-of-life care disparities. CONCLUSION: We observed racial disparities in early supportive medication use among patients with stage IV breast cancer. Although they did not clearly attenuate end-of-life care disparities, medication use disparities may be of concern if they point to disparities in adequacy of symptom management given the potential implications for quality of life. _ 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,,3,,,
2203,"The human sodium iodide symporter as a reporter gene for studying middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus pathogenesis Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is frequently used in oncology and cardiology to evaluate disease progression and/or treatment efficacy. Such technology allows for real-time evaluation of disease progression and when applied to studying infectious diseases may provide insight into pathogenesis. Insertion of a SPECT-compatible reporter gene into a virus may provide insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis and viral tropism. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), a SPECT and positron emission tomography reporter gene, was inserted into Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged virus that can cause severe respiratory disease and death in afflicted humans to obtain a quantifiable and sensitive marker for viral replication to further MERS-CoV animal model development. The recombinant virus was evaluated for fitness, stability, and reporter gene functionality. The recombinant and parental viruses demonstrated equal fitness in terms of peak titer and replication kinetics, were stable for up to six in vitro passages, and were functional. Further in vivo evaluation indicated variable stability, but resolution limits hampered in vivo functional evaluation. These data support the further development of hNIS for monitoring infection in animal models of viral disease.IMPORTANCE Advanced medical imaging such as single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) enhances fields such as oncology and cardiology. Application of SPECT/CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography to infectious disease may enhance pathogenesis studies and provide alternate biomarkers of disease progression. The experiments described in this article focus on insertion of a SPECT/CT-compatible reporter gene into MERS-CoV to demonstrate that a functional SPECT/CT reporter gene can be inserted into a virus.",,,5,,,
2204,"Serum mercury concentration and the risk of ischemic stroke: The REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Trace Element Study BACKGROUND: Although biologically plausible, epidemiological evidence linking exposure to methylmercury with increased risk of ischemic stroke is limited. The effects of methylmercury may be modified by selenium, which is an anti-oxidant that often co-exists with mercury in fish. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between serum mercury levels with the incidence of ischemic stroke and to explore the possible effect modifications by serum selenium levels and demographic and geographic factors. METHODS: A case-cohort study was designed nested in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke cohort, including 662 adjudicated incident cases of ischemic stroke and 2494 participants in a randomly selected sub-cohort. Serum mercury was measured using samples collected at recruitment. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Barlow-weighting method for the Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: No statistically significant association was observed between serum mercury concentration and the incidence of ischemic stroke (the highest vs. lowest quintile of mercury levels: HR_=_0.82; 95% CI_=_0.55-1.22; P for linear trend_=_0.42). Sex (P for interaction_=_0.06), but not serum selenium levels, modified the association; a more evident trend toward lower incidence of ischemic stroke with higher mercury levels was observed among women. CONCLUSION: This study does not support an association between mercury and the incidence of ischemic stroke within a population with low-to-moderate level of exposure. Further studies are needed to explore the possibility of mercury-induced ischemic stroke toxicity in other populations at higher exposure levels. Copyright _ 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

2205,"Breast Cancer Genetic and Molecular Subtype Impacts Response to Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters Epidemiological studies have correlated frequent omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid consumption with a lower risk for breast cancer; however, recent prospective studies have been less conclusive. Efforts in the preventive setting have focused on the use of n-3 fatty acids, and the pharmaceutical ethyl esters (EE) of these natural compounds, for high-risk patient populations. Limited understanding of specific mechanisms by which these agents function has hampered identification of the cancer subtype(s) that would gain the greatest therapeutic benefit. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of n-3 EEs in four distinct breast cancer subtypes and explored how they affect not only breast cancer cell survival but also modulate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-_B) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling pathways. Similar to the high variance in response observed in human studies, we found that the effectiveness of n-3 EEs depends on the molecular characteristics of the MCF-7, CAMA-1, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR3 breast cancer cell lines and is closely associated with the suppression of NF-_B. These data strongly suggest that the use of n-3 fatty acids and their pharmaceutical ether esters in the prevention and therapeutic setting should be guided by specific tumor characteristics.",,,3,,,
2206,"Replication of loci influencing ages at menarche and menopause in Hispanic women: the Women's Health Initiative SHARe Study Several genome-wide studies have identified loci associated with reproductive traits, such as ages of menarche and menopause, in women of European ancestry. In this study, we investigated the relevance of these loci in minority US Hispanic women. We utilized data from 3468 women who were genotyped as a part of the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource. We replicated associations of eight loci (LRP18, LIN28B, CENPW, INHBA, TMEM38B, ZNF483, NFAT5 and OLFM2) with age at menarche, and of two loci (MCM8 and BRSK1/TMEM150B) with age at menopause. The MCM8 locus was also associated with early menopause risk. Three loci (CENPW, MCM8 and BRSK1/TMEM150B) were associated with the length of reproductive lifespan. We provide evidence that genetic variants influencing reproductive traits identified in European populations are also important in minority US Hispanic women.",,,8,,,
2207,"Meta-analysis of loci associated with age at natural menopause in African-American women Age at menopause marks the end of a woman's reproductive life and its timing associates with risks for cancer, cardiovascular and bone disorders. GWAS and candidate gene studies conducted in women of European ancestry have identified 27 loci associated with age at menopause. The relevance of these loci to women of African ancestry has not been previously studied. We therefore sought to uncover additional menopause loci and investigate the relevance of European menopause loci by performing a GWAS meta-analysis in 6510 women with African ancestry derived from 11 studies across the USA. We did not identify any additional loci significantly associated with age at menopause in African Americans. We replicated the associations between six loci and age at menopause (P-value < 0.05): AMHR2, RHBLD2, PRIM1, HK3/UMC1, BRSK1/TMEM150B and MCM8. In addition, associations of 14 loci are directionally consistent with previous reports. We provide evidence that genetic variants influencing reproductive traits identified in European populations are also important in women of African ancestry residing in USA. _ The Author 2014.

2208,"A sex-specific association between a 15q25 variant and upper aerodigestive tract cancers BACKGROUND: Sequence variants located at 15q25 have been associated with lung cancer and propensity to smoke. We recently reported an association between rs16969968 and risk of upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancers (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and esophagus) in women (OR = 1.24, P = 0.003) with little effect in men (OR = 1.04, P = 0.35). METHODS: In a coordinated genotyping study within the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium, we have sought to replicate these findings in an additional 4,604 cases and 6,239 controls from 10 independent UADT cancer case-control studies. RESULTS: rs16969968 was again associated with UADT cancers in women (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.36, P = 0.001) and a similar lack of observed effect in men [OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.95-1.09, P = 0.66; P-heterogeneity (P(het)) = 0.01]. In a pooled analysis of the original and current studies, totaling 8,572 UADT cancer cases and 11,558 controls, the association was observed among females (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.12-1.34, P = 7 _ 10(-6)) but not males (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.97-1.08, P = 0.35; P(het) = 6 _ 10(-4)). There was little evidence for a sex difference in the association between this variant and cigarettes smoked per day, with male and female rs16969968 variant carriers smoking approximately the same amount more in the 11,991 ever smokers in the pooled analysis of the 14 studies (P(het) = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: This study has confirmed a sex difference in the association between the 15q25 variant rs16969968 and UADT cancers. IMPACT: Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations.",,,3,,,

2210,"Enhancing Community-Based Participatory Research Through Human-Centered Design Strategies Introduction. The purpose of this review is to compare and contrast the values, purpose, processes, and outcomes of human-centered design (HCD) and community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches to address public health issues and to provide recommendations for how HCD can be incorporated into CBPR partnerships and projects. Review Process. By consulting published literature, source materials, and experts on both approaches, a team of researchers completed a three-phased process of synthesizing key similarities and differences between HCD and CBPR and generating recommendations for ways to integrate HCD strategies in CBPR projects. Results. There are five HCD strategies that can be readily incorporated into CBPR projects to improve outcomes: (1) form transdisciplinary teams, (2) center empathy, (3) recruit and work with ""extreme users,"" (4) rapidly prototype, and (5) create tangible products or services. Conclusions. Integrating HCD in CBPR projects may lead to solutions that potentially have greater reach, are more readily adopted, are more effective, and add innovation to public health services, products, and policies.",,,5,,,
2211,"Biclustering with heterogeneous variance In cancer research, as in all of medicine, it is important to classify patients into etiologically and therapeutically relevant subtypes to improve diagnosis and treatment. One way to do this is to use clustering methods to find subgroups of homogeneous individuals based on genetic profiles together with heuristic clinical analysis. A notable drawback of existing clustering methods is that they ignore the possibility that the variance of gene expression profile measurements can be heterogeneous across subgroups, and methods that do not consider heterogeneity of variance can lead to inaccurate subgroup prediction. Research has shown that hypervariability is a common feature among cancer subtypes. In this paper, we present a statistical approach that can capture both mean and variance structure in genetic data. We demonstrate the strength of our method in both synthetic data and in two cancer data sets. In particular, our method confirms the hypervariability of methylation level in cancer patients, and it detects clearer subgroup patterns in lung cancer data.",,,1,,,
2212,"Role of spdef in the regulation of muc5b expression in the airways of naive and mucoobstructed mice Understanding how expression of airway secretory mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC is regulated in health and disease is important to elucidating the pathogenesis of mucoobstructive respiratory diseases. The transcription factor SPDEF (sterile _-motif pointed domain epithelial specific transcription factor) is a key regulator of MUC5AC, but its role in regulating MUC5B in health and in mucoobstructive lung diseases is unknown. Characterization of Spdef-deficient mice upper and lower airways demonstrated region-specific, Spdef-dependent regulation of basal Muc5b expression. Neonatal Spdef-deficient mice exhibited reductions in BAL Muc5ac and Muc5b. Adult Spdef-deficient mice partially phenocopied Muc5b-deficient mice as they exhibited reduced Muc5b in nasopharyngeal and airway epithelia but not in olfactory Bowman glands, 75% incidence of nasopharyngeal hair/mucus plugs, and mild bacterial otitis media, without defective mucociliary clearance in the nasopharynx. In contrast, tracheal mucociliary clearance was reduced in Spdef-deficient mice in the absence of lung disease. To evaluate the role of Spdef in the development and persistence of Muc5b-predominant mucoobstructive lung disease, Spdef-deficient mice were crossed with Scnn1b-transgenic (Scnn1b-Tg) mice, which exhibit airway surface dehydration-induced airway mucus obstruction and inflammation. Spdef-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited reduced Muc5ac, but not Muc5b, expression and BAL content. Airway mucus obstruction was not decreased in Spdef-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice, consistent with Muc5b-dominant Scnn1b disease, but increased airway neutrophilia was observed compared with Spdef-sufficient Scnn1b-Tg mice. Collectively, these results indicate that Spdef regulates baseline Muc5b expression in respiratory epithelia but does not contribute to Muc5b regulation in a mouse model of Muc5b-predominant mucus obstruction caused by airway dehydration.",,,1,,,
2213,"Serum sphingolipids and incident diabetes in a US population with high diabetes burden: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) BACKGROUND: Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of de novo sphingolipid synthases prevented diabetes in animal studies. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate prospective associations of serum sphingolipids with incident diabetes in a population-based cohort. METHODS: We included 2010 participants of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) aged 18-74 y who were free of diabetes and other major chronic diseases at baseline (2008-2011). Metabolomic profiling of fasting serum was performed using a global, untargeted approach. A total of 43 sphingolipids were quantified and, considering subclasses and chemical structures of individual species, 6 sphingolipid scores were constructed. Diabetes status was assessed using standard procedures including blood tests. Multivariable survey Poisson regressions were applied to estimate RR and 95% CI of incident diabetes associated with individual sphingolipids or sphingolipid scores. RESULTS: There were 224 incident cases of diabetes identified during, on average, 6 y of follow-up. After adjustment for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, a ceramide score (RR Q4 versus Q1_=_2.40; 95% CI: 1.24, 4.65; P-trend_=_0.003) and a score of sphingomyelins with fully saturated sphingoid-fatty acid pairs (RR Q4 versus Q1_=_3.15; 95% CI: 1.75, 5.67; P-trend_< 0.001) both were positively associated with risk of diabetes, whereas scores of glycosylceramides, lactosylceramides, or other unsaturated sphingomyelins (even if having an SFA base) were not associated with risk of diabetes. After additional adjustment for numerous traditional risk factors (especially triglycerides), both associations were attenuated and only the saturated-sphingomyelin score remained associated with risk of diabetes (RR Q4 versus Q1_=_1.98; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.59; P-trend_=_0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a cluster of saturated sphingomyelins may be associated with elevated risk of diabetes beyond traditional risk factors, which needs to be verified in other population studies.

2214,"Estimating individualized treatment rules for ordinal treatments Precision medicine is an emerging scientific topic for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual patient characteristics. It is an important direction for clinical research, and many statistical methods have been proposed recently. One of the primary goals of precision medicine is to obtain an optimal individual treatment rule (ITR), which can help make decisions on treatment selection according to each patient's specific characteristics. Recently, outcome weighted learning (OWL) has been proposed to estimate such an optimal ITR in a binary treatment setting by maximizing the expected clinical outcome. However, for ordinal treatment settings, such as individualized dose finding, it is unclear how to use OWL. In this article, we propose a new technique for estimating ITR with ordinal treatments. In particular, we propose a data duplication technique with a piecewise convex loss function. We establish Fisher consistency for the resulting estimated ITR under certain conditions, and obtain the convergence and risk bound properties. Simulated examples and an application to a dataset from a type 2 diabetes mellitus observational study demonstrate the highly competitive performance of the proposed method compared to existing alternatives. _ 2018, The International Biometric Society.",,,5,,,
2215,"Weekly sleep trajectories and their associations with obesity and hypertension in the Hispanic/Latino population Study Objectives: To identify weekly sleep trajectories (sleep pattern changing by day over a course of week) of specific characteristics and examine the associations between trajectory classes and obesity and hypertension. Methods: A total of 2043 participants (mean age 46.9, 65.5% female) completed at least 7 days of actigraphy aged 18-64 from the Sue_o ancillary study of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Weekly sleep trajectories for three daily level measures (wake after sleep onset [WASO], daytime napping duration, and intranight instability index) were identified using latent class growth models. The outcomes were obesity and hypertension. Results: Using the trajectory with low-stable WASO as reference, the trajectory classes with increasing and high-concave patterns had significantly higher odds for obesity (OR 3.64 [1.23-10.84]) and hypertension (OR 5.25 [1.33, 20.82]), respectively. Compared with individuals with a low-stable napping duration trajectory, those with the high-concave pattern class were associated with hypertension (OR 2.27 [1.10-4.67]), and the association was mediated in part by obesity (OR 1.11 [1.00-1.22]). Individuals in the high intranight instability index trajectory had significantly larger likelihood for both obesity (OR 1.90 [1.26-2.86]) and hypertension (OR 1.86 [1.13-3.06]) compared with those in the low intranight instability index trajectory. Conclusions: Weekly trajectories varied for WASO, daytime napping duration, and intranight instability index. The trajectories with relatively larger values for these three measures were associated with greater risk for obesity and hypertension. These findings suggest that a stable pattern with relatively small weekly and nightly variability may be beneficial for cardiovascular health.",,,1,,,

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 1,403 community-dwelling older women without dementia enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, 1996-1998. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed at the age of 71-89 years in 2005-2006 to obtain volumetric measures of gray matter (GM) and normal-appearing white matter (WM). Given residential histories and air monitoring data, we used a spatiotemporal model to estimate cumulative PM2.5 exposure in 1999-2006. Multiple linear regression was employed to evaluate the associations between PM2.5 and brain volumes, adjusting for intracranial volumes and potential confounders. RESULTS: Older women with greater PM2.5 exposures had significantly smaller WM, but not GM, volumes, independent of geographical region, demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyles, and clinical characteristics, including cardiovascular risk factors. For each interquartile increment (3.49_g/m(3) ) of cumulative PM2.5 exposure, the average WM volume (WMV; 95% confidence interval) was 6.23cm(3) (3.72-8.74) smaller in the total brain and 4.47cm(3) (2.27-6.67) lower in the association areas, equivalent to 1 to 2 years of brain aging. The adverse PM2.5 effects on smaller WMVs were present in frontal and temporal lobes and corpus callosum (all p values < 0.01). Hippocampal volumes did not differ by PM2.5 exposure. INTERPRETATION: PM2.5 exposure may contribute to WM loss in older women. Future studies are needed to determine whether exposures result in myelination disturbance, disruption of axonal integrity, damages to oligodendrocytes, or other WM neuropathologies. _ 2015 American Neurological Association.",,,3,,,

Using data from all four waves of Add Health study, this paper focuses on two outcomes: (1) depression and (2) levels of antidepressant use by race/ethnicity, immigrant generation, and linguistic acculturation levels during adulthood. Findings reveal that depression is prevalent among Mexican Americans, other Hispanics, and Asian Americans. Furthermore, Mexican Americans and Asian Americans have reported a lower level of antidepressant use than whites, with Asian Americans attaining the lowest level when immigrant generation, language acculturation levels, and other socioeconomic factors are held constant. We also find that those who are linguistically less acculturated have much lower levels of antidepressant use than their monolingual English-speaking counterparts.",,,4,,,
2220,"Bayesian modeling and inference for clinical trials with partial retrieved data following dropout In randomized clinical trials, it is common that patients may stop taking their assigned treatments and then switch to a standard treatment (standard of care available to the patient) but not the treatments under investigation. Although the availability of limited retrieved data on patients who switch to standard treatment, called off-protocol data, could be highly valuable in assessing the associated treatment effect with the experimental therapy, it leads to a complex data structure requiring the development of models that link the information of per-protocol data with the off-protocol data. In this paper, we develop a novel Bayesian method to jointly model longitudinal treatment measurements under various dropout scenarios. Specifically, we propose a multivariate normal mixed-effects model for repeated measurements from the assigned treatments and the standard treatment, a multivariate logistic regression model for those stopping the assigned treatments, logistic regression models for those starting a standard treatment off protocol, and a conditional multivariate logistic regression model for completely withdrawing from the study. We assume that withdrawing from the study is non-ignorable, but intermittent missingness is assumed to be at random. We examine various properties of the proposed model. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. We analyze in detail via the proposed method a real dataset from a clinical trial.

2221,"Successful _ cells islet regeneration in streptozotocin-induced diabetic baboons using ultrasound-targeted microbubble gene therapy with cyclinD2/CDK4/GLP1 Both major forms of diabetes mellitus (DM) involve _-cell destruction and dysfunction. New treatment strategies have focused on replenishing the deficiency of _-cell mass common to both major forms of diabetes by islet transplantation or _-cell regeneration. The pancreas, not the liver, is the ideal organ for islet regeneration, because it is the natural milieu for islets. Since islet mass is known to increase during obesity and pregnancy, the concept of stimulating pancreatic islet regeneration in vivo is both rational and physiologic. This paper proposes a novel approach in which non-viral gene therapy is targeted to pancreatic islets using ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) in a non-human primate model (NHP), the baboon. Treated baboons received a gene cocktail comprised of cyclinD2, CDK, and GLP1, which in rats results in robust and durable islet regeneration with normalization of blood glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels. We were able to generate important preliminary data indicating that gene therapy by UTMD can achieve in vivo normalization of the intravenous (IV) glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) curves in STZ hyperglycemic-induced conscious tethered baboons.

2222,"Multiple kernel learning with random effects for predicting longitudinal outcomes and data integration Predicting disease risk and progression is one of the main goals in many clinical research studies. Cohort studies on the natural history and etiology of chronic diseases span years and data are collected at multiple visits. Although, kernel-based statistical learning methods are proven to be powerful for a wide range of disease prediction problems, these methods are only well studied for independent data, but not for longitudinal data. It is thus important to develop time-sensitive prediction rules that make use of the longitudinal nature of the data. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical learning method for longitudinal data by introducing subject-specific short-term and long-term latent effects through a designed kernel to account for within-subject correlation of longitudinal measurements. Since the presence of multiple sources of data is increasingly common, we embed our method in a multiple kernel learning framework and propose a regularized multiple kernel statistical learning with random effects to construct effective nonparametric prediction rules. Our method allows easy integration of various heterogeneous data sources and takes advantage of correlation among longitudinal measures to increase prediction power. We use different kernels for each data source taking advantage of the distinctive feature of each data modality, and then optimally combine data across modalities. We apply the developed methods to two large epidemiological studies, one on Huntington's disease and the other on Alzheimer's Disease (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI) where we explore a unique opportunity to combine imaging and genetic data to study prediction of mild cognitive impairment, and show a substantial gain in performance while accounting for the longitudinal aspect of the data. _ 2015, The International Biometric Society.",,,1,,,
2223,"Dental treatment intensity in frail older adults in the last year of life BACKGROUND: Palliative care focusing on pain and infection is recommended for patients who are terminally ill. It is difficult to implement this strategy in practice because of the lack of clear guidelines. The authors conducted a study to examine dental treatment provided to a group of long-term care (LTC) residents in the last year of life. METHODS: The authors retrospectively followed 197 LTC residents (60 years or older) in the last year of life to death. On the basis of the dental services patients received between the new patient examination and death, the authors categorized the patients into three groups: no care (NC), limited care (LC) and usual care (UC). The authors developed a multivariable continuation ratio logit model with shared regression coefficients across two logits to identify the factors associated with the end-of-life dental care pattern. RESULTS: The authors found that 50.8 percent of the patients received NC before death. Among those who received treatment, 62.9 percent received UC, and 60.7 percent of the patients in the UC group had completed their treatment in the last three months of life. A three-month increment in survival and having dental insurance resulted in 1.74 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.30) and 2.59 (95 percent CI, 1.03-6.52) times greater odds, respectively, of receiving some dental treatment before death. Neither survival nor dental insurance, however, was associated with dental care intensity in the last year of life (that is, UC versus LC). CONCLUSIONS: While most of the patients who were in the last year of life received insufficient dental care, comprehensive treatment was provided commonly to frail patients at the end of life, raising questions about quality of care. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Palliative oral health management needs to be revisited to improve quality of care for frail older adults at the end of life.",,,5,,,
2224,"Crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain from newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected at least 77 people, with a fatality rate of more than 50%. Alarmingly, the virus demonstrates the capability of human-to-human transmission, raising the possibility of global spread and endangering world health and economy. Here we have identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the MERS-CoV spike protein and determined its crystal structure. This study also presents a structural comparison of MERS-CoV RBD with other coronavirus RBDs, successfully positioning MERS-CoV on the landscape of coronavirus evolution and providing insights into receptor binding by MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we found that MERS-CoV RBD functions as an effective entry inhibitor of MERS-CoV. The identified MERS-CoV RBD may also serve as a potential candidate for MERS-CoV subunit vaccines. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the evolution of coronavirus RBDs, provides insights into receptor recognition by MERS-CoV, and may help control the transmission of MERS-CoV in humans.",,,7,,,
2225,"Statistical considerations for the HPTN 052 Study to evaluate the effectiveness of early versus delayed antiretroviral strategies to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1 in serodiscordant couples The HIV Prevention Trial Network (HPTN) 052 Study is a Phase III, two-arm, controlled, open-labeled, randomized clinical trial designed to determine whether early antiretroviral therapy (ART) can prevent the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). A total of 1763 couples in which one partner was HIV-1-positive and the other was HIV-1-negative were enrolled in four continents, nine countries and thirteen study sites. The HIV-1-positive partner was randomly assigned to either of the two arms: ""immediate"" (early) therapy with ART initiated upon enrollment plus HIV primary care, or ""delayed"" therapy with HIV primary care but ART initiated when the index case would have two consecutive measurements of a CD4+ cell count within or below the range of 200-250 cells/mm(3), or develop an AIDS-defining illness. In this paper, we describe several key statistical considerations for the design of this landmark study. Despite that the observed event rates were lower than expected, which might have compromised the study power, an early release of the trial results in May 2011 showed an overwhelming 96% risk reduction for the immediate therapy in the prevention of genetically linked HIV-1 incident transmissions. Nevertheless, the durability of its long-term effectiveness is yet to be assessed. The HPTN 052 Study is still ongoing and will not complete till 2015. Copyright _ 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In the United States, the prevalence of obesity is higher in African Americans than whites, even after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES). This leads to the hypothesis that differences in genetic background may contribute to racial/ethnic differences in obesity-related traits. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a genome-wide admixture mapping scan using 1,350 ancestry-informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3,531 self-identified blacks from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We used these markers to estimate the overall proportions of European ancestry (PEAs) for each individual and then scanned for the association between PEA and obesity-related traits (both continuous and dichotomous) at each locus. The median (interquartile range) PEA was 0.151 (0.115). PEA was inversely correlated with continuous BMI, weight, and subscapular skinfold thickness, even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. In contrast, PEA was positively correlated with BMI-adjusted waist circumference. Using admixture mapping on dichotomized traits, we identified a locus on 2p23.3 to be suggestively associated with BMI (locus-specific lod = 4.11) and weight (locus-specific lod = 4.07). After adjusting for global PEA, each additional copy of a European ancestral allele at the 2p23.3 peak was associated with a BMI decrease of approximately 0.92 kg/m(2) (P = 2.9 x 10(-5)). Further mapping in this region on chromosome 2 may be able to uncover causative variants underlying obesity, which may offer insights into the control of energy homeostasis.",,,8,,,
2227,"Pleiotropic effects of genetic risk variants for other cancers on colorectal cancer risk: PAGE, GECCO and CCFR consortia OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a wide array of cancer sites. Several of these variants demonstrate associations with multiple cancers, suggesting pleiotropic effects and shared biological mechanisms across some cancers. We hypothesised that SNPs previously associated with other cancers may additionally be associated with colorectal cancer. In a large-scale study, we examined 171 SNPs previously associated with 18 different cancers for their associations with colorectal cancer. DESIGN: We examined 13 338 colorectal cancer cases and 40 967 controls from three consortia: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE), Genetic Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (GECCO), and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). Study-specific logistic regression results, adjusted for age, sex, principal components of genetic ancestry, and/or study specific factors (as relevant) were combined using fixed-effect meta-analyses to evaluate the association between each SNP and colorectal cancer risk. A Bonferroni-corrected p value of 2.92_10(-4) was used to determine statistical significance of the associations. RESULTS: Two correlated SNPs--rs10090154 and rs4242382--in Region 1 of chromosome 8q24, a prostate cancer susceptibility region, demonstrated statistically significant associations with colorectal cancer risk. The most significant association was observed with rs4242382 (meta-analysis OR=1.12; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.18; p=1.74_10(-5)), which also demonstrated similar associations across racial/ethnic populations and anatomical sub-sites. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to clearly demonstrate Region 1 of chromosome 8q24 as a susceptibility locus for colorectal cancer; thus, adding colorectal cancer to the list of cancer sites linked to this particular multicancer risk region at 8q24.",,,3,,,
2228,"Temporal trends in the population attributable risk for cardiovascular disease: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study BACKGROUND: The extent to which the relative contributions of traditional cardiovascular risk factors to incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) may have changed over time remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 13 541 participants (56% women, 26% black) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, aged 52 to 66 years and free of CVD at exams in 1987 through 1989, 1990 through 1992, 1993 through 1995, or 1996 through 1998. At each examination, we estimated the population attributable risks (PAR) of traditional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking) for the 10-year incidence of CVD. Overall, the PAR of all risk factors combined appeared to decrease from the late 1980s to the late 1990s (0.58 to 0.53). The combined PAR was higher in women than men in 1987 through 1989 (0.68 versus 0.51, P< 0.001) but not by the late 1990s (0.58 versus 0.48, P=0.08). The combined PAR was higher in blacks than whites in the late 1980s (0.67 versus 0.57, P=0.049), and this difference was more pronounced by the late 1990s (0.67 versus 0.48, P=0.002). By the late 1990s, the PAR of hypertension had become higher in women than men (P=0.02) and also appeared higher in blacks than whites (P=0.08). By the late 1990s, the PAR of diabetes mellitus remained higher in women than men (P< 0.0001) and in blacks than whites (P< 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The contribution to CVD of all traditional risk factors combined is greater in blacks than whites, and this difference may be increasing. The contributions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus remain especially high, in women as well as blacks. These findings underscore the continued need for individual as well as population approaches to CVD risk factor modification. _ 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,3,,,
2229,"Genetic variants in the mTOR pathway and breast cancer risk in African American women The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been implicated in breast carcinogenesis. However, there has been no large-scale investigation of genetic variants in the mTOR pathway and breast cancer risk. We examined 28847 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 61 mTOR pathway genes in the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk consortium of 3663 cases [1983 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and 1098 ER-negative (ER-)] and 4687 controls. Gene-level analyses were conducted using the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) test for 10773 SNPs that were not highly correlated (r (2) < 0.8), and SNP-level analyses were conducted with logistic regression. Among genes that were prioritized (nominal P < 0.05, ARTP tests), associations were observed for intronic SNPs TSC2 rs181088346 [odds ratio (OR) of each copy of variant allele = 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-0.88 for all breast cancer] and BRAF rs114729114 (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.24-1.91 for all breast cancer and OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.50-2.76 for ER- tumors). For ER- tumors, intronic SNPs PGF rs11542848 (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.15-1.66) and rs61759375 (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.14-1.57) and MAPK3 rs78564187 (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11-1.43) were associated with increased risk. These SNPs were significant at a gene-wide level (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05). The variant allele of RPS6KB2 rs35363135, a synonymous coding SNP, was more likely to be observed in ER- than ER+ tumors (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05-1.31, gene-wide Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.06). In conclusion, specific mTOR pathway genes are potentially important to breast cancer risk and to the ER negativity in African American women. _ The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

2230,"Association analyses of clustered competing risks data via cross hazard ratio Bandeen-Roche and Liang (2002, Modelling multivariate failure time associations in the presence of a competing risk. Biometrika 89, 299-314.) tailored Oakes (1989, Bivariate survival models induced by frailties. Journal of the American Statistical Association 84, 487-493.)'s conditional hazard ratio to evaluate cause-specific associations in bivariate competing risks data. In many population-based family studies, one observes complex multivariate competing risks data, where the family sizes may be > 2, certain marginals may be exchangeable, and there may be multiple correlated relative pairs having a given pairwise association. Methods for bivariate competing risks data are inadequate in these settings. We show that the rank correlation estimator of Bandeen-Roche and Liang (2002) extends naturally to general clustered family structures. Consistency, asymptotic normality, and variance estimation are easily obtained with U-statistic theories. A natural by-product is an easily implemented test for constancy of the association over different time regions. In the Cache County Study on Memory in Aging, familial associations in dementia onset are of interest, accounting for death prior to dementia. The proposed methods using all available data suggest attenuation in dementia associations at later ages, which had been somewhat obscured in earlier analyses.",,,1,,,
2231,"Epoetin Alfa and Outcomes in Dialysis amid Regulatory and Payment Reform Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are commonly used to treat anemia in patients with CKD, including those receiving dialysis, although clinical trials have identified risks associated with ESA use. We evaluated the effects of changes in dialysis payment policies and product labeling instituted in 2011 on mortality and major cardiovascular events across the United States dialysis population in an open cohort study of patients on dialysis from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, with Medicare as primary payer. We compared observed rates of death and major cardiovascular events in 2011 and 2012 with expected rates calculated on the basis of rates in 2005-2010, accounting for differences in patient characteristics and influenza virulence. An abrupt decline in erythropoietin dosing and hemoglobin concentration began in late 2010. Observed rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction in 2011 and 2012 were consistent with expected rates. During 2012, observed rates of stroke, venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), and heart failure were lower than expected (absolute deviation from trend per 100 patient-years [95% confidence interval]: -0.24 [-0.08 to -0.37] for stroke, -2.43 [-1.35 to -3.70] for VTE, and -0.77 [-0.28 to -1.27] for heart failure), although non-ESA-related changes in practice and Medicare payment penalties for rehospitalization may have confounded the results. This initial evidence suggests that action taken to mitigate risks associated with ESA use and changes in payment policy did not result in a relative increase in death or major cardiovascular events and may reflect improvements in stroke, VTE, and heart failure.

2232,"Temporal trends in diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of paediatric type 1 diabetes between 2006 and 2016: results from 13 countries in three continents AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this work was to evaluate geographical variability and trends in the prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), between 2006 and 2016, at the diagnosis of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in 13 countries over three continents. METHODS: An international retrospective study on DKA at diagnosis of diabetes was conducted. Data on age, sex, date of diabetes diagnosis, ethnic minority status and presence of DKA at diabetes onset were obtained from Australia, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, USA and the UK (Wales). Mean prevalence was estimated for the entire period, both overall and by country, adjusted for sex and age group. Temporal trends in annual prevalence of DKA were estimated using logistic regression analysis for each country, before and after adjustment for sex, age group and ethnic minority status. RESULTS: During the study period, new-onset type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 59,000 children (median age [interquartile range], 9.0_years [5.5-11.7]; male sex, 52.9%). The overall adjusted DKA prevalence was 29.9%, with the lowest prevalence in Sweden and Denmark and the highest in Luxembourg and Italy. The adjusted DKA prevalence significantly increased over time in Australia, Germany and the USA while it decreased in Italy. Preschool children, adolescents and children from ethnic minority groups were at highest risk of DKA at diabetes diagnosis in most countries. A significantly higher risk was also found for females in Denmark, Germany and Slovenia. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: DKA prevalence at type 1 diabetes diagnosis varied considerably across countries, albeit it was generally high and showed a slight increase between 2006 and 2016. Increased awareness of symptoms to prevent delay in diagnosis is warranted, especially in preschool children, adolescents and children from ethnic minority groups.",,,4,,,
2233,"Recognition of International Board Certified Lactation Consultants by health insurance providers in the United States: results of a national survey of lactation consultants BACKGROUND: Insurance coverage for lactation management is proposed by the United States Affordable Care Act. International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs) are key providers of lactation services. In order to inform national discussion, this study examines the scope of insurance reimbursement of IBCLC services. OBJECTIVES: An email survey of US IBCLCs (N = 10 495) in March 2011 was used to explore frequencies of (1) submission--how often lactation consults were submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement and (2) recognition--the proportion of submitted charges recognized by insurance providers. METHODS: Results (N = 2045) were analyzed to describe patterns of submission and recognition by IBCLC work setting, job classification, and reimbursement strategy. RESULTS: Many survey respondents did not know their submission (41%) or recognition (57%) levels. Multiple strategies were used for reimbursement of IBCLC services with large variations in recognition between strategies. Overall, less than 15% reported high levels of submissions to insurance providers. Moreover, of submitted encounters, only 4% were consistently recognized by insurance providers. Inpatient hospital IBCLCs were least likely to have consults recognized (3%), and private community IBCLCs were most frequently recognized (32%). Compared with using IBCLC credentials for submitting an encounter, using another clinical license was the most successful strategy for achieving recognition of IBCLC consults (crude risk ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.01; P = .02). CONCLUSION: IBCLCs provide key care to a vulnerable population. However, we found that these services are not consistently reimbursed. IBCLCs poorly communicate their health care activities to insurance providers, but insurance providers also inconsistently recognize and reimburse IBCLC care.",,,6,,,
2234,"Cumulative Lactation and Onset of Hypertension in African-American Women Hypertension affects nearly 1 of 3 women and contributes to cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Breastfeeding leads to metabolic changes that could reduce risks of hypertension. Hypertension disproportionately affects black women, but rates of breastfeeding among black women lag behind those in the general population. In the Black Women's Health Study (n = 59,001), we conducted a nested case-control analysis using unconditional logistic regression to estimate the association between breastfeeding and incident hypertension at ages 40-65 years using data collected from 1995 to 2011. Controls were frequency-matched 2:1 to 12,513 hypertensive women by age and questionnaire cycle. Overall, there was little evidence of association between ever breastfeeding and incident hypertension (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.92, 1.02). However, age modified the relationship (P = 0.02): Breastfeeding was associated with reduced risk of hypertension at ages 40-49 years (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 0.99) but not at older ages. In addition, risk of hypertension at ages 40-49 years decreased with increasing duration of breastfeeding (P for trend = 0.08). Our results suggest that long-duration breastfeeding may reduce the risk of incident hypertension in middle age. Addressing breastfeeding as a potential preventative health behavior is particularly compelling because it is required for only a discrete period of time. _ The Author(s) 2017.

2235,"Prepregnancy diabetes and breastfeeding cessation among black women in the united states Background: The incidence of diabetes is rising, and with it, the number of pregnancies affected by diabetes. U.S. black women have a disproportionately high prevalence of diabetes and lower rates of breastfeeding. Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between diabetes before pregnancy and breastfeeding duration among black women in the United States. Materials and Methods: We analyzed women from the Black Women's Health Study (N_=_59,000) to assess the relationship between prepregnancy diabetes and time to breastfeeding cessation occurring up to 24 months postdelivery using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models. The study population included primiparous women with births between 1995 and 2009 (N_=_3,404). Obesity, hypertension before pregnancy, and family history of diabetes were examined for effect modification. Results: Survival curves demonstrated a markedly reduced duration of breastfeeding in women who had been diagnosed with prepregnancy diabetes (p_< _0.01). The hazard ratio for breastfeeding cessation for women with prepregnancy diabetes was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.1-2.0) compared with women without prepregnancy diabetes after control for age, body mass index (BMI) at age 18, prepregnancy BMI, other metabolic factors, demographics, and health behaviors. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prepregnancy diabetes is a strong predictor of curtailed breastfeeding duration, even after control for BMI. This underscores the need for targeted lactation support for diabetic women.",,,4,,,
2236,"Individual and Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and the Association between Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease BACKGROUND: Long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is linked with cardiovascular disease, and disadvantaged status may increase susceptibility to air pollution-related health effects. In addition, there are concerns that this association may be partially explained by confounding by socioeconomic status (SES). OBJECTIVES: We examined the roles that individual- and neighborhood-level SES (NSES) play in the association between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular disease. METHODS: The study population comprised 51,754 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. PM2.5 concentrations were predicted at participant residences using fine-scale regionalized universal kriging models. We assessed individual-level SES and NSES (Census-tract level) across several SES domains including education, occupation, and income/wealth, as well as through an NSES score, which captures several important dimensions of SES. Cox proportional-hazards regression adjusted for SES factors and other covariates to determine the risk of a first cardiovascular event. RESULTS: A 5 _g/m3 higher exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a 13% increased risk of cardiovascular event [hazard ratio (HR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.26]. Adjustment for SES factors did not meaningfully affect the risk estimate. Higher risk estimates were observed among participants living in low-SES neighborhoods. The most and least disadvantaged quartiles of the NSES score had HRs of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.61) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.07), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Women with lower NSES may be more susceptible to air pollution-related health effects. The association between air pollution and cardiovascular disease was not explained by confounding from individual-level SES or NSES.

2238,"Ultraconserved elements in the human genome: association and transmission analyses of highly constrained single-nucleotide polymorphisms Ultraconserved elements in the human genome likely harbor important biological functions as they are dosage sensitive and are able to direct tissue-specific expression. Because they are under purifying selection, variants in these elements may have a lower frequency in the population but a higher likelihood of association with complex traits. We tested a set of highly constrained SNPs (hcSNPs) distributed genome-wide among ultraconserved and nearly ultraconserved elements for association with seven traits related to reproductive (age at natural menopause, number of children, age at first child, and age at last child) and overall [longevity, body mass index (BMI), and height] fitness. Using up to 24,047 European-American samples from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe), we observed an excess of associations with BMI and height. In an independent replication panel the most strongly associated SNPs showed an 8.4-fold enrichment of associations at the nominal level, including three variants in previously identified loci and one in a locus (DENND1A) previously shown to be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. Finally, using 1430 family trios, we showed that the transmissions from heterozygous parents to offspring of the derived alleles of rare (frequency _ 0.5%) hcSNPs are not biased, particularly after adjusting for the rates of genotype missingness and error in the data. The lack of transmission bias ruled out an immediately and strongly deleterious effect due to the rare derived alleles, consistent with the observation that mice homozygous for the deletion of ultraconserved elements showed no overt phenotype. Our study also illustrated the importance of carefully modeling potential technical confounders when analyzing genotype data of rare variants.",,,8,,,
2239,"A systematic review of interventions for promoting active transportation to school BACKGROUND: Active transportation to school is an important contributor to the total physical activity of children and adolescents. However, active school travel has declined over time, and interventions are needed to reverse this trend. The purpose of this paper is to review intervention studies related to active school transportation to guide future intervention research. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify intervention studies of active transportation to school published in the scientific literature through January 2010. Five electronic databases and a manual search were conducted. Detailed information was extracted, including a quantitative assessment comparing the effect sizes, and a qualitative assessment using an established evaluation tool. RESULTS: We identified 14 interventions that focused on active transportation to school. These interventions mainly focused on primary school children in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Almost all the interventions used quasi-experimental designs (10/14), and most of the interventions reported a small effect size on active transportation (6/14). CONCLUSION: More research with higher quality study designs and measures should be conducted to further evaluate interventions and to determine the most successful strategies for increasing active transportation to school. _ 2011 Chill_n P et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,0,,,
2240,"A cross-sectional study of demographic, environmental and parental barriers to active school travel among children in the United States BACKGROUND: Promoting daily routine physical activities, such as active travel to school, may have important health implications. Practitioners and policy makers must understand the variety of factors that influence whether or not a child uses active school travel. Several reviews have identified both inhibitors and promoters of active school travel, but few studies have combined these putative characteristics in one analysis. The purpose of this study is to examine associations between elementary school children's active school travel and variables hypothesized as correlates (demographics, physical environment, perceived barriers and norms). METHODS: The current project uses the dataset from the National Evaluation of Walk to School (WTS) Project, which includes data from 4th and 5th grade children and their parents from 18 schools across the US. Measures included monthly child report of mode of school travel during the previous week (n_=_10,809) and perceived barriers and social norms around active school travel by parents (n_=_1,007) and children (n_=_1,219). Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with log-link functions were used to assess bivariate and multivariate associations between hypothesized correlates and frequency of active school travel, assuming random school effect and controlling for the distance to school. RESULTS: The final model showed that the most relevant significant predictors of active school travel were parent's perceived barriers, specifically child resistance (Estimate_=_-0.438, p_< _0.0001) and safety and weather (Estimate_=_-0.0245, p_< _0.001), as well as the school's percentage of Hispanic students (Estimate_=_0.0059, p_< _0.001), after adjusting for distance and including time within school cluster as a random effect. CONCLUSIONS: Parental concerns may be impacting children's use of active school travel, and therefore, future interventions to promote active school travel should more actively engage parents and address these concerns. Programs like the Walk to School program, which are organized by the schools and can engage community resources such as public safety officials, could help overcome many of these perceived barriers to active transport.",,,0,,,
2241,"Active commuting and physical activity in adolescents from Europe: results from the HELENA study We assessed commuting patterns in adolescents from 10 European cities and examined associations with physical activity (PA). A total of 3112 adolescents were included. PA was objectively measured with accelerometry.

Adolescents reported to spend 30 min (15,60) [expressed as median (25th, 75th percentiles)] walking. In boys, associations between active commuting (walking and biking) and PA levels were observed for moderate, moderate-to-vigorous and overall PA. In girls, these associations were observed for moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA (walking). Similar results were found with the IPAQ-A. We observed positive associations between overall commuting and PA levels in European adolescents, yet due to the cross-sectional study design we cannot state the direction of these.

2242,"Infant and young child feeding decision making and practices: malawian mothers' and fathers' roles in the context of HIV BACKGROUND: Few studies in low- and middle-income countries have examined the roles of couples in infant and young child feeding decision making and practices, and there is no corresponding data in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Research aim: This study aimed to explore mothers' and fathers' perceptions of their roles in feeding decision making and practices. METHODS: The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 15 mothers and their male partners, recruited from the catchment areas of two urban and two rural government clinics in Lilongwe District, Malawi. The mothers were _ 18 years of age, were HIV positive, and had a child < 24 months of age. Twelve of the 15 fathers were also HIV positive. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Mothers were responsible for child care, including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. Fathers provided monetary support for purchasing food and offered verbal support to encourage mothers to implement recommended feeding practices. Many fathers found it difficult to support adequate complementary feeding because of household food insecurity. Mothers were advised on child feeding during prevention of mother-to-child transmission clinic visits. No fathers in this study accompanied women to clinic appointments, so they were less well-informed about feeding than mothers. Fathers usually deferred to mothers in feeding decision making. One-third of mothers wanted fathers to be more involved in child feeding. CONCLUSION: Malawian mothers' and fathers' roles in feeding decision making in the context of HIV align with local gender norms. Strategies are needed to improve fathers' knowledge of and involvement in child feeding, as desired by mothers.",,,5,,,
2243,"Mammalian Period represses and de-represses transcription by displacing CLOCK-BMAL1 from promoters in a Cryptochrome-dependent manner The mammalian circadian clock is based on a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) consolidated by secondary loops. In the primary TTFL, the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK)-brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) heterodimer acts as the transcriptional activator, and Cryptochrome (CRY) and Period (PER) proteins function as repressors. PER represses by displacing CLOCK-BMAL1 from promoters in a CRY-dependent manner. Interestingly, genes with complex promoters may either be repressed or de-repressed by PER, depending on the particular promoter regulatory elements. Here, using mouse cell lines with defined knockout mutations in clock genes, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and reporter gene assays coupled with measurements of DNA-protein interactions in nuclear extracts, we elucidate the dual functions of PER as repressor and de-repressor in a context-dependent manner.",,,5,,,
2244,"Defining abdominal obesity as a risk factor for coronary heart disease in the U.S.: results from the hispanic community health study/study of latinos (HCHS/SOL) OBJECTIVE: Various organizations have highlighted the need to examine whether abdominal obesity cut points are appropriate for identification of cardiovascular risk among ethnic minority adults, particularly Hispanic/Latino adults living in Western societies. This study aimed 1) to establish optimal definitions for abdominal obesity among Hispanics/Latinos and 2) to determine the level of agreement between the presence of metabolic syndrome diagnosed by the current Joint Interim Statement (JIS) definition and an updated definition with optimal abdominal obesity cut points. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample included 16,289 adults who self-identified as Hispanic/Latino ages 18-74 years enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to derive sensitivity and specificity values. The largest sum of sensitivity plus specificity was used to determine appropriate cut points. RESULTS: Among U.S. Hispanic/Latino adults, waist circumference cut points of >102 cm in men (in line with current JIS criteria) and >97 cm (9 points higher than JIS criteria) in women provide optimal discrimination for cardiovascular risk as judged by the presence of coronary heart disease. When using these cut points to create an updated metabolic syndrome definition among women, we found disagreement between our updated definition and the current JIS criteria. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was overestimated by _5 percentage points among women based on JIS criteria in comparison with our definition. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the current recommendations for waist circumference cut points may not be appropriate for U.S. Hispanic/Latino women. _ 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.",,,4,,,

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of the racial composition of residents on nursing homes' financial and quality performance. The study examined Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing homes across the United States that submitted Medicare cost reports between the years 1999 and 2004 (11,472 average per year). DATA SOURCE: Data were obtained from the Minimum Data Set, the On-Line Survey Certification and Reporting, Medicare Cost Reports, and the Area Resource File. STUDY DESIGN: Panel data regression with random intercepts and negative binomial regression were conducted with state and year fixed effects. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Financial and quality performance differed between nursing homes with high proportions of black residents and nursing homes with no or medium proportions of black residents. Nursing homes with no black residents had higher revenues and higher operating margins and total profit margins and they exhibited better processes and outcomes than nursing homes with high proportions of black residents.

2246,"Culture change in nursing homes: what is the role of nursing home resources? Quality of care has been a long-standing issue in US nursing homes. The culture change movement attempts to transition nursing homes from health care institutions to person-centered homes. While the adoption of culture change has been spreading across nursing homes, barriers to adoption persist. Nursing homes that disproportionately serve minority residents may have additional challenges implementing culture change compared with other facilities due to limited financial and staffing resources. The objective of this study was to examine how nursing home characteristics are associated with culture change adoption in Central Florida nursing homes. This cross-sectional study included 81 directors of nursing (DONs) who completed the Artifacts of Culture Change survey. In addition, nursing home organizational data were obtained from the Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports (CASPER). A logistic regression was conducted to examine the relationship between high culture change adoption and nursing home characteristics. The overall adoption of culture change scores in Central Florida nursing homes was low. Nevertheless, there was variability across nursing homes in the adoption of culture change.

STUDY DESIGN: As a result of a 2013 policy change, children with ABD eligibility transitioned from fee-for-service to capitated care. We used Ohio Medicaid claims data from July 2013 through June 2015 to explore the relationships among instability in eligibility category, demographics, and utilization. METHODS: To examine the potential financial effect of categorical churn, an effective capitation rate was created to capture the proportion of the maximum potential capitation rate that was realized. RESULTS: More than 20% of children exited ABD-based eligibility at least once. Switching was associated with younger age and rural residence and was not associated with healthcare use. CONCLUSIONS: Switching between eligibility categories is common and affects average capitation but not health service use.",,,9,,,
2248,"TNF-insulin crosstalk at the transcription factor GATA6 is revealed by a model that links signaling and transcriptomic data tensors Signal transduction networks coordinate transcriptional programs activated by diverse extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors and cytokines. Cells receive multiple stimuli simultaneously, and mapping how activation of the integrated signaling network affects gene expression is a challenge. We stimulated colon adenocarcinoma cells with various combinations of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the growth factors insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) to investigate signal integration and transcriptional crosstalk. We quantitatively linked the proteomic and transcriptomic data sets by implementing a structured computational approach called tensor partial least squares regression. This statistical model accurately predicted transcriptional signatures from signaling arising from single and combined stimuli and also predicted time-dependent contributions of signaling events. Specifically, the model predicted that an early-phase, AKT-associated signal downstream of insulin repressed a set of transcripts induced by TNF. Through bioinformatics and cell-based experiments, we identified the AKT-repressed signal as glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser(37) on the long form of the transcription factor GATA6. Phosphorylation of GATA6 on Ser(37) promoted its degradation, thereby preventing GATA6 from repressing transcripts that are induced by TNF and attenuated by insulin. Our analysis showed that predictive tensor modeling of proteomic and transcriptomic data sets can uncover pathway crosstalk that produces specific patterns of gene expression in cells receiving multiple stimuli.

2249,"Fine mapping and identification of serum urate loci in American Indians: The Strong Heart Family Study While studies have reported genetic loci affecting serum urate (SU) concentrations, few studies have been conducted in minority populations. Our objective for this study was to identify genetic loci regulating SU in a multigenerational family-based cohort of American Indians, the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). We genotyped 162,718 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2000 SHFS participants using an Illumina MetaboChip array. A genome-wide association analysis of SU was conducted using measured genotype analysis approach accounting for kinships in SOLAR, and meta-analysis in METAL. Our results showed strong association of SU with rs4481233, rs9998811, rs7696092 and rs13145758 (minor allele frequency (MAF)_=_25-44%; P_< _3___10-14) of solute carrier family 2, member 9 (SLC2A9) and rs41481455, rs2231142 and rs1481012 (MAF_=_29%; p_< _3___10-9) of ATP-binding cassette protein, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2). Carriers of G alleles of rs9998811, rs4148155 and rs1481012 and A alleles of rs4481233,_rs7696092 and rs13145758 and rs2231142 had lower SU concentrations as compared to non-carriers. Genetic analysis of SU conditional on significant SLC2A9 and ABCG2 SNPs revealed new loci, nucleobindin 1 (NUCB1) and neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) (p_< 6__10-6). To identify American Indian-specific SNPs, we conducted targeted sequencing of key regions of SLC2A9. A total of 233 SNPs were identified of which 89 were strongly associated with SU (p_< _7.1___10-10) and 117 were American Indian specific. Analysis of key SNPs in cohorts of Mexican-mestizos, European, Indian and East Asian ancestries showed replication of common SNPs, including our lead SNPs. Our results demonstrate the association of SU with uric acid transporters in a minority population of American Indians and potential novel associations of SU with neuronal-related genes which warrant further investigation.",,,8,,,
2250,"Genetic variation underlying renal uric acid excretion in Hispanic children: the Viva La Familia Study BACKGROUND: Reduced renal excretion of uric acid plays a significant role in the development of hyperuricemia and gout in adults. Hyperuricemia has been associated with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease in children and adults. There are limited genome-wide association studies associating genetic polymorphisms with renal urate excretion measures. Therefore, we investigated the genetic factors that influence the excretion of uric acid and related indices in 768 Hispanic children of the Viva La Familia Study. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association analysis for 24-h urinary excretion measures such as urinary uric acid/urinary creatinine ratio, uric acid clearance, fractional excretion of uric acid, and glomerular load of uric acid in SOLAR, while accounting for non-independence among family members. RESULTS: All renal urate excretion measures were significantly heritable (p < 2___10-6) and ranged from 0.41 to 0.74. Empirical threshold for genome-wide significance was set at p < 1___10-7. We observed a strong association (p_< _8___10-8) of uric acid clearance with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in zinc finger protein 446 (ZNF446) (rs2033711 (A/G), MAF: 0.30). The minor allele (G) was associated with increased uric acid clearance. Also, we found suggestive associations of uric acid clearance with SNPs in ZNF324, ZNF584, and ZNF132 (in a 72_kb region of 19q13; p < 1___10-6, MAFs: 0.28-0.31). CONCLUSION: For the first time, we showed the importance of 19q13 region in the regulation of renal urate excretion in Hispanic children. Our findings indicate differences in inherent genetic architecture and shared environmental risk factors between our cohort and other pediatric and adult populations.",,,8,,,
2251,"GWAS and transcriptional analysis prioritize ITPR1 and CNTN4 for a serum uric acid 3p26 QTL in Mexican Americans BACKGROUND: The variation in serum uric acid concentrations is under significant genetic influence. Elevated SUA concentrations have been linked to increased risk for gout, kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease whereas reduced serum uric acid concentrations have been linked to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we identified a novel locus on chromosome 3p26 affecting serum uric acid concentrations in Mexican Americans from San Antonio Family Heart Study. As a follow up, we examined genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data in an extended cohort of 1281 Mexican Americans from multigenerational families of the San Antonio Family Heart Study and the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study. We used a linear regression-based joint linkage/association test under an additive model of allelic effect, while accounting for non-independence among family members via a kinship variance component. RESULTS: Univariate genetic analysis indicated serum uric acid concentrations to be significant heritable (h (2) = 0.50 _ 0.05, p < 4 _ 10(-35)), and linkage analysis of serum uric acid concentrations confirmed our previous finding of a novel locus on 3p26 (LOD = 4.9, p < 1 _ 10(-5)) in the extended sample. Additionally, we observed strong association of serum uric acid concentrations with variants in following candidate genes in the 3p26 region; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1 (ITPR1), contactin 4 (CNTN4), decapping mRNA 1A (DCP1A); transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 26 (ARHGEF26) [p < 3 _ 10(-7); minor allele frequencies ranged between 0.003 and 0.42] and evidence of cis-regulation for ITPR1 transcripts. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the importance of the chromosome 3p26 locus and genetic variants in this region in the regulation of serum uric acid concentrations.",,,8,,,
2252,"Vitamin D heritability and effect of pregnancy status in Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) under conditions of modest and high dietary supplementation OBJECTIVES: The two objectives of the current study were to: 1) investigate the genetic contributions to variations in serum vitamin D concentrations under two dietary conditions (a standard monkey biscuit diet vs. a diet designed to model typical American consumption); and 2) explore the interaction of vitamin D with pregnancy status using a cohort of pedigreed female vervet/African green monkeys. METHODS: This study includes 185 female (_3.5 years) vervet/African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) from a multi-generational, pedigreed breeding colony. The 25(OH)D3 concentrations were first measured seven to eight weeks after consuming a ""typical American"" diet (TAD), deriving 37, 18, and 45% of calories from fat, protein sources, and carbohydrates, and supplemented with vitamin D to a human equivalent of 1,000 IU/day. Vitamin D concentrations were assessed again when animals were switched to a low-fat, standard biscuit diet (LabDiet 5038) for 8 months, which provided a human equivalent of approximately 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D. All statistical analyses were implemented in SOLAR. RESULTS: Pregnancy was associated with reduced 25(OH)D3 concentrations. Heritability analyses indicated a significant genetic contribution to 25(OH)D3 concentrations in the same monkeys consuming the biscuit diet (h(2) =0.66, P=0.0004) and TAD (h(2) =0.67, P=0.0078) diets, with higher 25(OH)D3 concentrations in animals consuming the biscuit diet. Additionally, there was a significant genotype-by-pregnancy status interaction on 25(OH)D3 concentrations (P< 0.05) only among animals consuming the TAD diet. DISCUSSION: These results support the existence of a genetic contribution to differences in serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations by pregnancy status and emphasize the role of diet (including vitamin D supplementation) in modifying genetic signals as well as vitamin D concentrations. _ 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,4,,,

2254,"The value of informal care in the context of option B+ in Malawi: a contingent valuation approach BACKGROUND: Informal care, the health care provided by the patient's social network is important in low income settings although its monetary value is rarely estimated. The lack of estimates of the value of informal care has led to its omission in economic evaluations but this can result in incorrect decisions about cost effectiveness of an intervention. We explore the use of contingent valuation methods of willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) to estimate the value of informal care provided to HIV infected women that are accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) under the Option B+ approach to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV in Malawi. METHODS: We collected cross sectional data from 93 caregivers of women that received ART care from six health facilities in Malawi. Caregivers of women that reported for ART care on the survey day and consented to participate in the survey were included until the targeted sample size for the facility was reached. We estimated the value of informal care by using the willingness to accept (WTA) and willingness to pay (WTP) approaches. Medians were used to summarize the values and these were compared by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The median WTA to provide informal care in a month was US$30 and the median WTP for informal care was US$13 and the two were statistically different (p < 0.000). Median WTP was higher in the urban areas than in the rural areas (US$21 vs. US$13, p < 0.001) and for caregivers from households from higher wealth quintile than in the lower quintile (US$15 vs. US$13, p < 0.0462). CONCLUSION: Informal caregivers place substantial value on informal care giving. In low income settings where most caregivers are not formally employed, WTP and WTA approaches can be used to value informal care. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT02005835.",,,6,,,
2255,"Keeping adolescent orphans in school to prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection: evidence from a randomized controlled trial in Kenya PURPOSE: We report the findings from a pilot study in western Kenya, using an experimental design to test whether comprehensive support used to keep adolescent orphans in school can reduce risk factors associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus. METHODS: Adolescent orphans aged 12-14 years (N = 105) in Nyanza Province were randomized to condition, after stratifying by household, gender, and baseline survey report of sexual behavior. The intervention comprised school fees, uniforms, and a ""community visitor"" who monitored school attendance and helped to resolve problems that would lead to absence or dropout. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations over two time points, controlling for gender and age. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, intervention students were less likely to drop out of school, commence sexual intercourse, or report attitudes supporting early sex. School support also increased prosocial bonding and gender equity attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: After 1 year of exposure to the intervention, we found evidence suggesting that comprehensive school support can prevent school dropout, delay sexual debut, and reduce risk factors associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Further research, with much larger samples, is needed to better understand factors that mediate the association between educational support and delayed sexual debut, and how gender might moderate these relationships.

2256,"Discordance of HIV and HSV-2 biomarkers and self-reported sexual behaviour among orphan adolescents in Western Kenya BACKGROUND: This paper examines the discordance between biological data of HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections and self-reported questionnaire responses among orphan adolescents in Western Kenya. METHODS: In 2011, 837 orphan adolescents from 26 primary schools were enrolled in an HIV prevention trial. At baseline, blood samples were drawn for HIV and HSV-2 infection biomarker testing, and participants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interviewing survey. RESULTS: Comparing biological data with self-reported responses indicated that 70% of HIV-positive (7 out of 10) and 64% of HSV-2-positive (18 out of 28 positive) participants reported never having had sex. Among ever-married adolescents, 65% (57 out of 88) reported never having had sex. Overall, 10% of study participants appeared to have inconsistently reported their sexual behaviour. Logistic regression analyses indicated that lower educational level and exam scores were significant predictors of inconsistent reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the discordance between infections measured by biomarkers and self-reports of having had sex among orphan adolescents in Kenya. In order to detect programme effects accurately in prevention research, it is necessary to collect both baseline and endline biological data. Furthermore, it is recommended to triangulate multiple data sources about adolescent participants' self-reported information about marriage and pregnancies from school records and parent/guardians to verify the information. Researchers should recognise potential threats to validity in data and design surveys to consider cognitive factors and/or cultural context to obtain more accurate and reliable information from adolescents regarding HIV/sexually transmitted infection risk behaviours.

2257,"School support as structural HIV prevention for adolescent orphans in western kenya PURPOSE: Using a clustered randomized controlled trial design, we evaluated whether support to keep Kenyan orphaned adolescents in school reduces the risk of HIV infection. METHODS: Participants included 835 orphaned boys and girls in grades 7 and 8 (mean age at the baseline_=_15 years) in western Kenya. Primary schools (N_=_26) were randomized to the study condition. Intervention participants received school uniforms, payment of tuition when they transitioned into high school, and nurse visits to monitor school absenteeism and provide assistance to stay in school. Annual surveys were conducted from 2011 through 2014, and HIV and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) biomarker data were collected at the baseline and the end line. Data were analyzed using survey logistic regression or generalized estimating equations controlling for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Intervention and control groups were equivalent at the baseline and did not differ on new HIV or HSV-2 incidence at the end line. The school support intervention increased school retention but had few HIV-related effects, except increased circumcision among male participants and reduced likelihood of transactional sex. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a strong study design, we found no relative reduction in HIV or HSV-2 infection after 3 years of intervention implementation. New incidence of HIV was lower than expected in this region among youth whose average age at end line was 18 years (range_=_14-23). Although support for secondary school promises many benefits for vulnerable youth, our study adds to the growing body of research showing weak evidence for its effectiveness as an HIV prevention.

2258,"Prognostic significance of gene-specific promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer patients The association between promoter methylation status and survival was investigated in a large cohort of women with breast cancer, participants in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. Archived tumor tissues (n = 839) were collected from women diagnosed with a first primary invasive or in situ breast cancer in 1996-1997. Vital status was followed through the end of 2005 with a mean follow-up time of 8 years. Promoter methylation of eight breast cancer-related genes was assessed by MethyLight. The frequencies of methylation for HIN1, RASSF1A, DAPK1, GSTP1, CyclinD2, TWIST, CDH1 and RAR_ were 62.9, 85.2, 14.1, 27.8, 19.6, 15.3, 5.8 and 27.6%, respectively. Since survival rates of in situ and invasive breast cancers are substantially different, survival analyses were conducted within 670 invasive cases with complete data on all genes. Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models revealed that GSTP1, TWIST and RAR_ methylation was significantly associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality. Methylation of GSTP1 and RAR_ was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality. To investigate the relationship between the number of methylated genes and breast cancer-specific mortality, we included previously published MethyLight data on p16 and APC methylation status. Breast cancer-specific mortality increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing number of methylated genes (P (trend) = 0.002), although confidence intervals were wide. Our results suggest that promoter methylation, particularly for a panel of genes, has the potential to be used as a biomarker for predicting prognosis in breast cancer.",,,3,,,
2259,"Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies eight new loci for type 2 diabetes in east Asians We conducted a three-stage genetic study to identify susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in east Asian populations. We followed our stage 1 meta-analysis of eight T2D genome-wide association studies (6,952 cases with T2D and 11,865 controls) with a stage 2 in silico replication analysis (5,843 cases and 4,574 controls) and a stage 3 de novo replication analysis (12,284 cases and 13,172 controls). The combined analysis identified eight new T2D loci reaching genome-wide significance, which mapped in or near GLIS3, PEPD, FITM2-R3HDML-HNF4A, KCNK16, MAEA, GCC1-PAX4, PSMD6 and ZFAND3. GLIS3, which is involved in pancreatic beta cell development and insulin gene expression, is known for its association with fasting glucose levels. The evidence of an association with T2D for PEPD and HNF4A has been shown in previous studies. KCNK16 may regulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the pancreas. These findings, derived from an east Asian population, provide new perspectives on the etiology of T2D.",,,8,,,
2260,"The relationship between health-related variables and increases in smoking among recently diagnosed HIV+ people who inject drugs in Vietnam BACKGROUND: In Vietnam tobacco smoking is prevalent among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and causes excess mortality in this population. Injection drug use is a driver of HIV infections in Vietnam. Changes in HIV disease state may correlate to changes in smoking among PLHIV. This study investigates the relationship between increases in smoking and health-related variables among recently diagnosed HIV+ people who inject drugs (PWID) in Vietnam. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data from 323 recently diagnosed HIV+ PWID in a randomized controlled trial from 2009 to 2013 in Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam. The outcome was an increase of >one cigarette/day from baseline visit cigarette smoking. A generalized estimating equation for repeated measures was used to estimate bivariable and multivariable associations between participant characteristics and smoking increases. We collected qualitative data to enhance our understanding of quantitative results, from 16 HIV+ PWID who smoke. RESULTS: Ninety three point 5% of participants reported some smoking at baseline. Smoking fewer cigarettes, higher health related quality of life (QOL), and higher CD4 counts were predictive of increases in smoking at future visits in a multivariable model. Qualitative data showed smoking increases were tied to improved perceived health, and counseling during respiratory illnesses may increase intention to quit. CONCLUSION: HIV+ PWID in Vietnam smoke at a very high rate. Increases in their smoking are correlated to increases in heath-related QOL, and increases in perceptions of health. Any tobacco-use intervention should account for internal tobacco use triggers faced by HIV+ PWID. Copyright _ 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,6,,,
2261,"Maternal exposure to outdoor air pollution and congenital limb deficiencies in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study BACKGROUND: Congenital limb deficiencies (CLDs) are a relatively common group of birth defects whose etiology is mostly unknown. Recent studies suggest maternal air pollution exposure as a potential risk factor. AIM: To investigate the relationship between ambient air pollution exposure during early pregnancy and offspring CLDs. METHODS: The study population was identified from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a population-based multi-center case-control study, and consisted of 615 CLD cases and 5,701 controls with due dates during 1997 through 2006. Daily averages and/or maxima of six criteria air pollutants (particulate matter < 2.5__ [PM2.5], particulate matter < 10__ [PM10], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], sulfur dioxide [SO2], carbon monoxide [CO], and ozone [O3]) were averaged over gestational weeks 2-8, as well as for individual weeks during this period, using data from EPA air monitors nearest to the maternal address. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and study center. We estimated aORs for any CLD and CLD subtypes (i.e., transverse, longitudinal, and preaxial). Potential confounding by co-pollutant was assessed by adjusting for one additional air pollutant. Using the single pollutant model, we further investigated effect measure modification by body mass index, cigarette smoking, and folic acid use. Sensitivity analyses were conducted restricting to those with a residence closer to an air monitor. RESULTS: We observed near-null aORs for CLDs per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM10, PM2.5, and O3. However, weekly averages of the daily average NO2 and SO2, and daily max NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations were associated with increased odds of CLDs. The crude ORs ranged from 1.03 to 1.12 per IQR increase in these air pollution concentrations, and consistently elevated aORs were observed for CO. Stronger associations were observed for SO2 and O3 in subtype analysis (preaxial). In co-pollutant adjusted models, associations with CO remained elevated (aORs: 1.02-1.30); but aORs for SO2 and NO2 became near-null. The aORs for CO remained elevated among mothers who lived within 20__m of an air monitor. The aORs varied by maternal BMI, smoking status, and folic acid use. CONCLUSION: We observed modest associations between CLDs and air pollution exposures during pregnancy, including CO, SO2, and NO2, though replication through further epidemiologic research is warranted.

2262,"Receipt of tobacco direct mail/email discount coupons and trajectories of cigarette smoking behaviours in a nationally representative longitudinal cohort of US adults BACKGROUND: We assessed whether receipt of coupons-via direct mail or e-mail-was prospectively related to trajectories of smoking behaviours. METHODS: Data were from a cohort of US adults (n=26_447) who participated in wave 1 (2013-2014) and wave 2 (2014-2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. Participants reported receipt of tobacco direct mail/email coupons in the past 6__onths in wave 1 and their smoking status in both waves. Weighted multiple logistic regressions were used to examine demographic correlates of receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons at wave 1 and to examine the prospective effect of receiving tobacco coupons on trajectories of smoking behaviours. FINDINGS: At wave 1, 10.7% of never smokers, 13.9% of experimental smokers, 37.1% of current smokers and 16.5% of former smokers reported receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons. Lower education and higher poverty adults and non-Hispanic white current smokers were more likely to have received these coupons (p< 0.05). Receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons at wave 1 was associated with increased odds of smoking initiation among never smokers (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.83), becoming established smokers among experimenters (AOR=1.62, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.04), becoming daily smokers among non-daily smokers (AOR=1.56, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.99) and smoking relapse among former smokers between waves (AOR=1.91, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.65). Receiving these coupons at wave 1 was associated with reduced odds of smoking cessation _6 months among current smokers (AOR=0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco direct mail/email coupons encourage and sustain smoking and disproportionately affect lower socioeconomic populations. _ Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

2263,"Receipt of tobacco direct mail coupons and changes in smoking status in a nationally representative sample of US adults Introduction: Direct-to-consumer tobacco marketing, including direct mail and email coupons, is a potentially influential marketing strategy. We examined the associations between receipt of tobacco direct mail/email coupons and trajectories of smoking behavior among US adults. Methods: Data were from the US Population Assessment on Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study adult sample (n = 32160) collected during 2013-2014. Participants self-reported their smoking status (every day, some days, not at all) 12 months prior to the survey (T0) and at the time of the survey (T1). Three smoking trajectories were identified: nonsmokers progressing to current smokers, current smokers continuing to smoke, and among current smokers at T0, progressing to or continuing with daily smoking. Participants also reported receipt of direct mail/email tobacco coupons in the 6 months preceding T1 (yes/no). Weighted multiple logistic regression models were used to test the associations between receiving direct mail/email tobacco coupons and different smoking trajectories adjusted for demographic characteristics. Results: One in eight (12.4%) US adult nonsmokers and 36.2% adult smokers at T0 reported receiving tobacco coupons. Receipt of tobacco coupons was negatively associated with poverty status. Receipt of tobacco coupons was associated with increased odds of progression to current smoking (AOR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.12), continuation of smoking (AOR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.65), and current smokers' progression to or continuation with daily smoking (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.50 to 1.91). Conclusions: Direct-to-consumer tobacco coupons may promote progression of smoking among nonsmokers, and continuation of smoking and progression to daily smoking among smokers in US adults. Implications: Distributing direct mail coupons is a strategy employed by tobacco companies to promote their products. We found, in a US national study, that many adults received tobacco coupons, and receiving these coupons was associated with subsequent progression of smoking among nonsmokers, and continuation of smoking and daily smoking among smokers. Scrutiny over the use of direct mail coupons and its effects on population health is warranted. Future research is needed to evaluate the effect of different interventions to reduce the impact of these coupons on smoking behaviors.",,,5,,,
2264,"Condom use intentions mediate the relationships between psychosocial constructs and HIV sexual risk behavior in young Black men who have sex with men HIV prevention interventions that reduce sexual risk behaviors among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM), the most severely affected population in the United States, are critical for reducing disparities in HIV infection. However, there are few theory-based sexual risk reduction interventions designed specifically for YBMSM. This study tested the applicability of the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM), which theorizes that behavioral intentions mediate the relationship between psychosocial constructs and health behavior on condomless anal intercourse (CAI) among YBMSM. To test key constructs of the IBM, analyses were conducted with baseline data from the HealthMpowerment (HMP) randomized controlled trial. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, attitudes, intentions, and environmental constraints, and CAI. Mediation analysis was conducted to determine if condom use intentions mediated the relationship between psychosocial constructs (i.e., condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes) and CAI. Overall 55.7% reported one or more acts of CAI with a male partner in the past 3 months. Those who reported CAI in the 3 months prior to the baseline survey reported lower self-efficacy for condom use, lower condom use norms, more negative attitudes toward condom use, and lower condom use intentions at baseline than those who reported no CAI. In mediation analysis, the relationships between CAI and self-efficacy for condom use (estimated indirect effect_=_-0.004 (SE_=_0.002)), condom use norms (-0.002 (SE_=_0.001)) and attitudes toward condom use (-0.005 (SE_=_0.002)) were mediated by condom use intentions. This study applied the IBM to sexual risk behavior among a sample of YBMSM. Results indicate that the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes, and CAI were mediated by condom use intentions. Future theory-informed interventions should focus on increasing self-efficacy for condom use, condom use norms, attitudes toward condom use, and condom use intentions to reduce CAI among YBMSM.",,,2,,,
2265,"Serum C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin G antibodies to periodontal pathogens may be effect modifiers of periodontitis and hyperglycemia BACKGROUND: Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated in both periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus through inflammation. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis have been found in periodontal pockets in patients with diabetes. This study examines effect modification by examining the extent to which the associations between periodontitis and hyperglycemia were different by levels of serum CRP and periodontal pathogens. METHODS: Blood samples with plasma were evaluated for immunoglobulin G antibodies, CRP, and fasting glucose from 5,731 participants _ 20 years old receiving oral examinations and providing other health-related data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. The study participants were classified into quartiles of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The first quartile was the reference. Logistic regression models with survey procedures were used to explore the roles of inflammation levels from serum CRP and periodontal pathogens on the relations with periodontitis, including PD, CAL, and hyperglycemia, and their joint associations with interaction terms. RESULTS: Stronger associations between PD and diabetes existed in people having elevated CRP and titers for P. gingivalis; odds ratios comparing extreme quartiles of PD were 1.31 and 3.40 in the groups with low and high CRP, respectively, and 1.28 and 2.96 in groups with low and high titers for P. gingivalis, respectively. The joint association patterns were similar for CAL and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The strengths of association between periodontitis and diabetes were stronger in people having elevated serum CRP and P. gingivalis titers.

We sought to validate the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as a depression screening tool at a high HIV-burden primary care clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a validation study of an interviewer-administered PHQ-9 among 397 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-9 were calculated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the reference standard; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression was 11.8%. One-third of participants tested positive for HIV. HIV-infected patients were more likely to be depressed (15%) than uninfected patients (9%; p=0.08). Using the standard cutoff score of _10, the PHQ-9 had a sensitivity of 78.7% (95% CI: 64.3-89.3) and specificity of 83.4% (95% CI: 79.1-87.2). The area under the ROC curve was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83-0.92). Test performance did not vary by HIV status or language. In sensitivity analyses, reference test bias associated with the MINI appeared unlikely. LIMITATIONS: We were unable to conduct qualitative work to adapt the PHQ-9 to this cultural context. CONCLUSION: This is the first validation study of the PHQ-9 in a primary care clinic in sub-Saharan Africa. It highlights the potential for using primary care as an access point for identifying depressive symptoms during routine HIV testing. The PHQ-9 showed reasonable accuracy in classifying cases of depression, was easily implemented by lay health workers, and is a useful screening tool in this setting. Copyright _ 2014 Elsevier B.V.

2267,"Mind the Gap: Gaps in Antidepressant Treatment, Treatment Adjustments, and Outcomes among Patients in Routine HIV Care in a Multisite U.S. Clinical Cohort BACKGROUND: Depression affects 20-30% of HIV-infected patients and is associated with worse HIV outcomes. Although effective depression treatment is available, depression is largely untreated or undertreated in this population. METHODS: We quantified gaps in antidepressant treatment, treatment adjustments, and outcomes among US patients in routine HIV care in the nationally distributed CNICS observational clinical cohort. This cohort combines detailed clinical data with regular, self-reported depressive severity assessments (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9). We considered whether participants with likely depression received antidepressants, whether participants on antidepressants with persistently high depressive symptoms received timely dose adjustments, and whether participants achieved depression remission. We considered a cross-sectional analysis (6,219 participants in care in 2011-2012) and a prospective analysis (2,936 participants newly initiating CNICS care when PHQ-9 screening was active). RESULTS: The cross-sectional sample was 87% male, 53% Caucasian, 25% African American, and 18% Hispanic; the prospective sample was similar. In both samples, 39-44% had likely depression, with 44-60% of those receiving antidepressants. Of participants receiving antidepressants, 20-26% experienced persistently high depressive symptoms; only a small minority of those received antidepressant dose adjustments. Overall, 35-40% of participants on antidepressants achieved full depression remission. Remission among participants with persistently high depressive symptoms was rare regardless of dose adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, diverse cohort of US patients engaged in routine HIV care, we observed large gaps in antidepressant treatment, timely dose adjustment to address persistently high depressive symptoms, and antidepressant treatment outcomes. These results highlight the importance of more effective pharmacologic depression treatment models for HIV-infected patients.",,,6,,,
2268,"Depression and Engagement in Care Among Newly Diagnosed HIV-Infected Adults in Johannesburg, South Africa Delayed engagement in HIV care threatens the success of HIV treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa and may be influenced by depression. We examined the relationship between depression prior to HIV diagnosis and engagement in HIV care at a primary care clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. We screened 1683 patients for depression prior to HIV testing using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Among patients who tested positive for HIV we assessed linkage to HIV care, defined as obtaining a CD4 count within 3_months. Among those who linked to care and were eligible for ART, we assessed ART initiation within 3_months. Multivariable Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator was used to assess the association between depression and linkage to care or ART initiation. The prevalence of HIV was 26_% (n_=_340). Among HIV-infected participants, the prevalence of depression was 30_%. The proportion of linkage to care was 80_% among depressed patients and 73_% among patients who were not depressed (risk ratio 1.08; 95_% confidence interval 0.96, 1.23). Of the participants who linked to care, 81_% initiated ART within 3_months in both depressed and not depressed groups (risk ratio 0.99; 95_% confidence interval 0.86, 1.15). Depression was not associated with engagement in HIV care in this South African primary care setting. Our unexpected findings suggest that some depressed HIV-infected patients might be more likely to engage in care than their counterparts without depression, and highlight the complex relationship between depression and HIV infection. These findings have led us to propose a new framework relating HIV infection, depression, and the population under study.",,,6,,,
2269,"Breast cancer biologic and etiologic heterogeneity by young age and menopausal status in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study: a case-control study BACKGROUND: Young-onset breast cancer (< 40_years) is associated with worse prognosis and higher mortality. Breast cancer risk factors may contribute to distinct tumor biology and distinct age at onset, but understanding of these relationships has been hampered by limited representation of young women in epidemiologic studies and may be confounded by menopausal status. METHODS: We examined tumor characteristics and epidemiologic risk factors associated with premenopausal women's and young women's breast cancer in phases I-III of the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (5309 cases, 2022 control subjects). Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess heterogeneity by age (< 40 vs. _40_years) and menopausal status. RESULTS: In both premenopausal and postmenopausal strata, younger women had more aggressive disease, including higher stage, hormone receptor-negative, disease as well as increased frequency of basal-like subtypes, lymph node positivity, and larger tumors. Higher waist-to-hip ratio was associated with reduced breast cancer risk among young women but with elevated risk among older women. Parity was associated with increased risk among young women and reduced risk among older women, while breastfeeding was more strongly protective for young women. Longer time since last birth was protective for older women but not for young women. In comparison, when we stratified by age, menopausal status was not associated with distinct risk factor or tumor characteristic profiles, except for progesterone receptor status, which was more commonly positive among premenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Age is a key predictor of breast cancer biologic and etiologic heterogeneity and may be a stronger determinant of heterogeneity than menopausal status. Young women's breast cancer appears to be etiologically and biologically distinct from that among older women.",,,3,,,
2270,"Biology and Etiology of Young-Onset Breast Cancers among Premenopausal African American Women: Results from the AMBER Consortium Background: African American (AA) women have higher incidence of aggressive, young-onset (< 40 years) breast cancers. Young- and older-onset disease may have distinct tumor biologies and etiologies; however, studies investigating age differences among AA women have been rare and generally underpowered.Methods: We examined tumor characteristics and breast cancer risk factors associated with premenopausal young (< 40) vs. older (_40) AA women's breast cancer in the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium (2,008 cases and 5,144 controls). Unconditional logistic regression models assessed heterogeneity of tumor biology and risk factor associations by age, overall, and by estrogen receptor status.Results: Premenopausal AA women < 40 years had higher frequency of poorer-prognosis tumor characteristics compared with older women, including negative estrogen and progesterone receptor status, triple-negative subtype, higher grade, higher stage, and larger tumors. Adiposity (i.e., waist-to-hip ratio) and family history of breast cancer were more strongly associated with young-onset disease [case-control OR = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-2.05; OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 2.08-4.63, respectively] compared with older-onset disease (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.91-1.35; OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.26-1.94). Breastfeeding showed a slight inverse risk association among young women (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.43-1.16). Oral contraceptive use was associated with increased risk regardless of age. Considering various cutoff points for young age (< 40, < 45, < 50), age-related heterogeneity was greatest when < 40 was used.Conclusions: Among premenopausal AA women, diagnosis before age 40 is associated with more aggressive breast tumor biology and some etiologic differences.Impact: Modifiable risk factors including breastfeeding, adiposity, and oral contraceptive use may be important targets for mitigating harms of young-onset breast cancer.

2271,"Curing HIV: Pharmacologic approaches to target HIV-1 latency HIV-1 infection persists even after years of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although ART can halt viral replication and thereby reduce viremia to clinically undetectable levels, proviral latency established within the host genome remains largely unaffected by ART and can replenish systemic infection following interruption of therapy. Pharmacologic strategies, which not only target viral replication but also deplete proviral infection, are required for successful clearance of HIV-1 infection. This review highlights the current understanding of molecular mechanisms that establish and maintain HIV-1 latency in its major reservoir, the resting memory CD4(+) T cell. We also identify the molecular targets that might be exploited to induce HIV-1 expression, remove epigenetic restrictions, or enhance effective transcription. Finally, we discuss the potential pharmacologic approaches toward targeting viral persistence in different cellular and anatomical reservoirs to achieve a cure of HIV-1 infection.",,,6,,,
2272,"Demographic and developmental differences in the content and sequence of adolescents' ideal romantic relationship behaviors This study utilizes data from 18,392 respondents (aged 12-19) in Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to provide a detailed descriptive analysis of U.S. adolescents' desired behaviors in their ideal romantic relationships. Age, gender, and ethnic group differences in the desire for--and preferred sequence of--a set of activities that could occur in a hypothetical romantic relationship were explored within subsets of heterosexual (n = 17,274) and sexual minority adolescents (n = 1118). Non-sexual behaviors were more commonly desired compared to sexual behaviors. The typical desired behavioral sequence was: holding hands, going out alone, telling others they were a couple, kissing, saying ""I love you,"" sexual touching, and finally having sex. Overall, more similarities than differences emerged across groups, with some notable differences in the percentages who desired sexual behaviors. Results provide a nuanced picture of adolescent relationship scripts, with implications for education and prevention. Copyright _ 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

2273,"Risk behaviours among female sex workers in China: a systematic review and data synthesis BACKGROUND: Commercial sex is one of the major modes of HIV transmission in China. Understanding HIV risk behaviours in female sex workers (FSW) is of great importance for prevention. This study aims to assess the magnitude and temporal changes of risk behaviours in Chinese FSW. METHOD: Five electronic databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed English and Chinese language articles published between January 2000 and December 2012 that reported risk behaviours among FSW in China, including condom use, HIV testing, and drug use. Linear regression and Spearman's rank correlation were used to examine temporal trends in these risk factors. The study followed PRISMA guidelines for meta-analyses and was registered in the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews. RESULTS: A total of 583 articles (44 English, 539 Chinese) investigating 594,583 Chinese FSW were included in this review. At last sex, condom use was highest with commercial partners (clients), increasing from 53.7% in 2000 to 84.9% in 2011. During this same time period, condom use increased with regular partners from 15.2% to 40.4% and with unspecified partners from 38.6% to 82.5%. Increasing trends were also found in the proportion of sampled FSW who reported testing for HIV in the past 12 months (from 3.2% in 2000 to 48.0% in 2011), while drug use behaviours decreased significantly from 10.9% to 2.6%. CONCLUSION: During the first decade of 2000, Chinese FSWs' self-reported risk behaviours have decreased significantly while HIV testing has increased. Further outreach and intervention efforts are needed to encourage condom use with regular partners, continue promotion of HIV testing, and provide resources for the most vulnerable FSW, particularly low tier FSW, who may have limited access to sexual health and prevention programs.",,,6,,,
2274,"Behavioral Interventions Improve Condom Use and HIV Testing Uptake Among Female Sex Workers in China: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Condomless commercial sex work is a common mode of HIV transmission in China. This study systematically reviews the impacts of behavioral interventions on condom use and HIV testing uptake among female sex workers (FSW) in China. Chinese and English language peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and December 2013 were searched in five electronic databases. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by comparing the levels of improvements in condom use and HIV testing uptake by various intervention strategies. Study quality was assessed for included studies. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO. One hundred and twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses indicated that FSW in the post-intervention period were 2.3-5.0 times more likely to use condoms with male clients in their last sexual act and 2.3-3.4 times more likely to use condoms consistently in the last month than in the pre-intervention period. In particular, multiple session intervention were more effective in improving condom use among FSW with male clients (OR=5.6, [4.0-7.8]) than a single session intervention (OR=3.3, [2.8-3.8]). Behavioral interventions also improved past-12-month HIV testing uptake 4.6-fold (95% CI, 2.9-7.4). Comprehensive intervention programs were more effective (OR=8.1, [4.0-16.7]) in improving HIV testing uptake compared with health education only programs (OR=2.7, [1.6-4.5]). Longer intervention duration (>12 months) did not increase effectiveness in improving condom use or HIV testing rate among Chinese FSWs. Behavioral interventions are effective in improving condom use and HIV testing uptake among Chinese FSW. This review highlights both the potentials and limitations of condom promotion interventions targeting female sex workers.",,,6,,,
2275,"Estimated plasma stearoyl co-A desaturase-1 activity and risk of incident diabetes: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study OBJECTIVE: Evidence from pre-clinical studies suggests inhibition of stearoyl co-A desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity improves insulin sensitivity. Translation of these findings to humans remains less defined. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the association between different measures of SCD-1 activity and incident diabetes in a large, prospective human study. METHODS: In 2738 white participants (aged 45-64 yrs, 47% men) who were free of diabetes at baseline, SCD-1 activity was estimated at baseline by plasma fatty acid ratios in cholesterol esters (SCD16c=16:1n-7/16:0, SCD18c =18:1n-9/18:0) and in phospholipids (SCD16p=16:1n-7/16:0, SCD18p=18:1n-9/18:0). Incident diabetes was ascertained during 3 follow-up visits. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the association between estimated SCD-1 activity and incident diabetes. RESULTS: During follow-up (mean 8.0_SE 2.1 years), 207 (7.6%) participants developed diabetes. After adjusting for age and sex, higher SCD16c, higher SCD16p, and lower SCD18p were significantly associated with incident diabetes. After additional adjustment for education, parental history of diabetes, smoking, dietary intake (carbohydrate, fiber, saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fat), alcohol use, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, and lipid composition - only SCD16c remained significantly associated with incident diabetes (Hazard Ratio=1.1 linearly across decreasing quintiles, 95% CI 1.01-1.30; p =0.03) which remained nominally associated after adjusting for insulin resistance (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a large community-based prospective cohort study, the estimate of SCD-1 activity by SCD16c had the strongest association with incident diabetes. Refinement of SCD-1 measurement and replication of its association with incident diabetes in an independent cohort is recommended. Copyright _ 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,9,,,

2277,"Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years--Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2012 PROBLEM/CONDITION: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). PERIOD COVERED: 2012. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance system that provides estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States (Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin). Surveillance to determine ASD case status is conducted in two phases. The first phase consists of screening and abstracting comprehensive evaluations performed by professional service providers in the community. Data sources identified for record review are categorized as either 1) education source type, including developmental evaluations to determine eligibility for special education services or 2) health care source type, including diagnostic and developmental evaluations. The second phase involves the review of all abstracted evaluations by trained clinicians to determine ASD surveillance case status. A child meets the surveillance case definition for ASD if one or more comprehensive evaluations of that child completed by a qualified professional describes behaviors that are consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision diagnostic criteria for any of the following conditions: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (including atypical autism), or Asperger disorder. This report provides ASD prevalence estimates for children aged 8 years living in catchment areas of the ADDM Network sites in 2012, overall and stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and the type of source records (education and health records versus health records only). In addition, this report describes the proportion of children with ASD with a score consistent with intellectual disability on a standardized intellectual ability test, the age at which the earliest known comprehensive evaluation was performed, the proportion of children with a previous ASD diagnosis, the specific type of ASD diagnosis, and any special education eligibility classification. RESULTS: For 2012, the combined estimated prevalence of ASD among the 11 ADDM Network sites was 14.6 per 1,000 (one in 68) children aged 8 years. Estimated prevalence was significantly higher among boys aged 8 years (23.6 per 1,000) than among girls aged 8 years (5.3 per 1,000). Estimated ASD prevalence was significantly higher among non-Hispanic white children aged 8 years (15.5 per 1,000) compared with non-Hispanic black children (13.2 per 1,000), and Hispanic (10.1 per 1,000) children aged 8 years. Estimated prevalence varied widely among the 11 ADDM Network sites, ranging from 8.2 per 1,000 children aged 8 years (in the area of the Maryland site where only health care records were reviewed) to 24.6 per 1,000 children aged 8 years (in New Jersey, where both education and health care records were reviewed). Estimated prevalence was higher in surveillance sites where education records and health records were reviewed compared with sites where health records only were reviewed (17.1 per 1,000 and 10.7 per 1,000 children aged 8 years, respectively; p< 0.05). Among children identified with ASD by the ADDM Network, 82% had a previous ASD diagnosis or educational classification; this did not vary by sex or between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black children. A lower percentage of Hispanic children (78%) had a previous ASD diagnosis or classification compared with non-Hispanic white children (82%) and with non-Hispanic black children (84%). The median age at earliest known comprehensive evaluation was 40 months, and 43% of children had received an earliest known comprehensive evaluation by age 36 months. The percentage of children with an earliest known comprehensive evaluation by age 36 months was similar for boys and girls, but was higher for non-Hispanic white children (45%) compared with non-Hispanic black child en (40%) and Hispanic children (39%). INTERPRETATION: Overall estimated ASD prevalence was 14.6 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in the ADDM Network sites in 2012. The higher estimated prevalence among sites that reviewed both education and health records suggests the role of special education systems in providing comprehensive evaluations and services to children with developmental disabilities. Disparities by race/ethnicity in estimated ASD prevalence, particularly for Hispanic children, as well as disparities in the age of earliest comprehensive evaluation and presence of a previous ASD diagnosis or classification, suggest that access to treatment and services might be lacking or delayed for some children. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The ADDM Network will continue to monitor the prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 8 years living in selected sites across the United States. Recommendations from the ADDM Network include enhancing strategies to 1) lower the age of first evaluation of ASD by community providers in accordance with the Healthy People 2020 goal that children with ASD are evaluated by age 36 months and begin receiving community-based support and services by age 48 months; 2) reduce disparities by race/ethnicity in identified ASD prevalence, the age of first comprehensive evaluation, and presence of a previous ASD diagnosis or classification; and 3) assess the effect on ASD prevalence of the revised ASD diagnostic criteria published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.",,,2,,,
2278,"Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 4 Years - Early Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, Seven Sites, United States, 2010, 2012, and 2014 PROBLEM/CONDITION: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is estimated to affect up to 3% of children in the United States. Public health surveillance for ASD among children aged 4 years provides information about trends in prevalence, characteristics of children with ASD, and progress made toward decreasing the age of identification of ASD so that evidence-based interventions can begin as early as possible. PERIOD COVERED: 2010, 2012, and 2014. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Early Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (Early ADDM) Network is an active surveillance system that provides biennial estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 4 years whose parents or guardians lived within designated sites. During surveillance years 2010, 2012, or 2014, data were collected in seven sites: Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The Early ADDM Network is a subset of the broader ADDM Network (which included 13 total sites over the same period) that has been conducting ASD surveillance among children aged 8 years since 2000. Each Early ADDM site covers a smaller geographic area than the broader ADDM Network. Early ADDM ASD surveillance is conducted in two phases using the same methods and project staff members as the ADDM Network. The first phase consists of reviewing and abstracting data from children's records, including comprehensive evaluations performed by community professionals. Sources for these evaluations include general pediatric health clinics and specialized programs for children with developmental disabilities. In addition, special education records (for children aged _3 years) were reviewed for Arizona, Colorado, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Utah, and early intervention records (for children aged 0 to < 3 years) were reviewed for New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin; in Wisconsin, early intervention records were reviewed for 2014 only. The second phase involves a review of the abstracted evaluations by trained clinicians using a standardized case definition and method. A child is considered to meet the surveillance case definition for ASD if one or more comprehensive evaluations of that child completed by a qualified professional describes behaviors consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for any of the following conditions: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism), or Asperger disorder (2010, 2012, and 2014). For 2014 only, prevalence estimates based on surveillance case definitions according to DSM-IV-TR and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) were compared. This report provides estimates of overall ASD prevalence and prevalence by sex and race/ethnicity; characteristics of children aged 4 years with ASD, including age at first developmental evaluation, age at ASD diagnosis, and cognitive function; and trends in ASD prevalence and characteristics among Early ADDM sites with data for all 3 surveillance years (2010, 2012, and 2014), including comparisons with children aged 8 years living in the same geographic area. Analyses of time trends in ASD prevalence are restricted to the three sites that contributed data for all 3 surveillance years with consistent data sources (Arizona, Missouri, and New Jersey). RESULTS: The overall ASD prevalence was 13.4 per 1,000 children aged 4 years in 2010, 15.3 in 2012, and 17.0 in 2014 for Early ADDM sites with data for the specific years. ASD prevalence was determined using a surveillance case definition based on DSM-IV-TR. Within each surveillance year, ASD prevalence among children aged 4 years varied across surveillance sites and was lowest each year for Missouri (8.5, 8.1, and 9.6 per 1,000, for 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively) and highest each year for New Jersey (19.7, 22.1, and 28.4 per 1,000, for the same years, respectively). Aggregated prevalence estimates were higher fo sites that reviewed education and health care records than for sites that reviewed only health care records. Among all participating sites and years, ASD prevalence among children aged 4 years was consistently higher among boys than girls; prevalence ratios ranged from 2.6 (Arizona and Wisconsin in 2010) to 5.2 boys per one girl (Colorado in 2014). In 2010, ASD prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic white children than among Hispanic children in Arizona and non-Hispanic black children in Missouri; no other differences were observed by race/ethnicity. Among four sites with _60% data on cognitive test scores (Arizona, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Utah), the frequency of co-occurring intellectual disabilities was significantly higher among children aged 4 years than among those aged 8 years for each site in each surveillance year except Arizona in 2010. The percentage of children with ASD who had a first evaluation by age 36 months ranged from 48.8% in Missouri in 2012 to 88.9% in Wisconsin in 2014. The percentage of children with a previous ASD diagnosis from a community provider varied by site, ranging from 43.0% for Arizona in 2012 to 86.5% for Missouri in 2012. The median age at earliest known ASD diagnosis varied from 28 months in North Carolina in 2014 to 39.0 months in Missouri and Wisconsin in 2012. In 2014, the ASD prevalence based on the DSM-IV-TR case definition was 20% higher than the prevalence based on the DSM-5 (17.0 versus 14.1 per 1,000, respectively). Trends in ASD prevalence and characteristics among children aged 4 years during the study period were assessed for the three sites with data for all 3 years and consistent data sources (Arizona, Missouri, and New Jersey) using the DSM-IV-TR case definition; prevalence was higher in 2014 than in 2010 among children aged 4 years in New Jersey and was stable in Arizona and Missouri. In Missouri, ASD prevalence was higher among children aged 8 years than among children aged 4 years. The percentage of children with ASD who had a comprehensive evaluation by age 36 months was stable in Arizona and Missouri and decreased in New Jersey. In the three sites, no change occurred in the age at earliest known ASD diagnosis during 2010-2014. INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that ASD prevalence among children aged 4 years was higher in 2014 than in 2010 in one site and remained stable in others. Among children with ASD, the frequency of cognitive impairment was higher among children aged 4 years than among those aged 8 years and suggests that surveillance at age 4 years might more often include children with more severe symptoms or those with co-occurring conditions such as intellectual disability. In the sites with data for all years and consistent data sources, no change in the age at earliest known ASD diagnosis was found, and children received their first developmental evaluation at the same or a later age in 2014 compared with 2010. Delays in the initiation of a first developmental evaluation might adversely affect children by delaying access to treatment and special services that can improve outcomes for children with ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Efforts to increase awareness of ASD and improve the identification of ASD by community providers can facilitate early diagnosis of children with ASD. Heterogeneity of results across sites suggests that community-level differences in evaluation and diagnostic services as well as access to data sources might affect estimates of ASD prevalence and age of identification. Continuing improvements in providing developmental evaluations to children as soon as developmental concerns are identified might result in earlier ASD diagnoses and earlier receipt of services, which might improve developmental outcomes.",,,3,,,
2279,"A novel mouse model for genetic variation in 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase exhibits disturbed purine synthesis with impacts on pregnancy and embryonic development Genetic variants in one-carbon folate metabolism have been identified as risk factors for disease because they may impair the production or use of one-carbon folates required for nucleotide synthesis and methylation. p.R653Q (1958G>A) is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formylTHF) synthetase domain of the trifunctional enzyme MTHFD1; this domain produces the formylTHF which is required for the de novo synthesis of purines. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are homozygous for the Q allele. MTHFD1 p.R653Q has been proposed as a risk factor for neural tube defects (NTDs), congenital heart defects (CHDs) and pregnancy losses. We have generated a novel mouse model in which the MTHFD1 synthetase activity is inactivated without affecting protein expression or the other activities of this enzyme. Complete loss of synthetase activity (Mthfd1S(-/-)) is incompatible with life; embryos die shortly after 10.5 days gestation, and are developmentally delayed or abnormal. The proportion of 10-formylTHF in the plasma and liver of Mthfd1S(+/-) mice is reduced (P < 0.05), and de novo purine synthesis is impaired in Mthfd1S(+/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, P < 0.005). Female Mthfd1S(+/-) mice had decreased neutrophil counts (P < 0.05) during pregnancy and increased incidence of developmental defects in embryos (P = 0.052). These findings suggest that synthetase deficiency may lead to pregnancy complications through decreased purine synthesis and reduced cellular proliferation. Additional investigation of the impact of synthetase polymorphisms on human pregnancy is warranted.",,,1,,,
2280,"Oral bisphosphonates and risk of ischemic stroke: a case-control study UNLABELLED: Bisphosphonates have been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and may thus be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. This would have substantial clinical and public health implications. We found no evidence of an association between bisphosphonate use and risk of ischemic stroke. INTRODUCTION: Bisphosphonates have been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in some studies and may be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, data regarding these possibilities are limited. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of 6,257 female cases of ischemic stroke and 31,285 age- and gender-matched population controls. Data on bisphosphonate use, other medication use, comorbidity, and ischemic stroke were obtained from medical databases. Current bisphosphonate use was defined as at least one redeemed prescription within 90 days before diagnosis/index date. We estimated the odds ratio (OR) of ischemic stroke among users and nonusers of bisphosphonates using conditional logistic regression, controlling for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two (2.9%) cases and 901 (2.9%) controls were current users of bisphosphonates. Etidronate and alendronate were prescribed with similar frequency among cases and controls. The adjusted OR of ischemic stroke for bisphosphonate users compared with nonusers was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.15). New and continuing bisphosphonate users had adjusted ORs for ischemic stroke of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.69-1.96) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.81-1.16), respectively. Excluding patients with known atrial fibrillation/flutter yielded an OR of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.85-1.19). The OR for ischemic stroke was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.32-1.09) among patients with a history of previous hospitalization for cardiovascular disease and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.88-1.18) among those without (P < 0.001). The OR for former users was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.01-1.49). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of an association of oral bisphosphonate use with the risk of ischemic stroke.",,,3,,,

2282,"Risk of childhood undernutrition related to small-for-gestational age and preterm birth in low- and middle-income countries BACKGROUND: Low- and middle-income countries continue to experience a large burden of stunting; 148 million children were estimated to be stunted, around 30-40% of all children in 2011. In many of these countries, foetal growth restriction (FGR) is common, as is subsequent growth faltering in the first 2 years. Although there is agreement that stunting involves both prenatal and postnatal growth failure, the extent to which FGR contributes to stunting and other indicators of nutritional status is uncertain. METHODS: Using extant longitudinal birth cohorts (n=19) with data on birthweight, gestational age and child anthropometry (12-60 months), we estimated study-specific and pooled risk estimates of stunting, wasting and underweight by small-for-gestational age (SGA) and preterm birth. RESULTS: We grouped children according to four combinations of SGA and gestational age: adequate size-for-gestational age (AGA) and preterm; SGA and term; SGA and preterm; and AGA and term (the reference group). Relative to AGA and term, the OR (95% confidence interval) for stunting associated with AGA and preterm, SGA and term, and SGA and preterm was 1.93 (1.71, 2.18), 2.43 (2.22, 2.66) and 4.51 (3.42, 5.93), respectively. A similar magnitude of risk was also observed for wasting and underweight. Low birthweight was associated with 2.5-3.5-fold higher odds of wasting, stunting and underweight. The population attributable risk for overall SGA for outcomes of childhood stunting and wasting was 20% and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis estimates that childhood undernutrition may have its origins in the foetal period, suggesting a need to intervene early, ideally during pregnancy, with interventions known to reduce FGR and preterm birth.",,,3,,,
2283,"Use of antipsychotic medications in pediatric and young adult populations: future research needs The use of antipsychotics, particularly second generation antipsychotics, among children and adolescents has increased markedly during the past 20 years. Existing evidence gaps make this practice controversial and hinder treatment decision-making. This article describes and prioritizes future research needs regarding antipsychotic treatment in youth, focusing on within-class and between-class drug comparisons with regard to key population subgroups, efficacy and effectiveness outcomes, and adverse event outcomes. Using as a foundation a recent systematic review of antipsychotic treatment among youth, which was completed by a different Evidence-based Practice Center, we worked with a diverse group of 12 stakeholders representing researchers, funders, health care providers, patients, and families to identify and prioritize research needs. From an initial list of 16 evidence gaps, we enumerated 6 high-priority research needs: 1) long-term comparative effectiveness across all psychiatric disorders; 2) comparative long-term risks of adverse outcomes; 3) short-term risks of adverse events; 4) differentials of efficacy, effectiveness, and safety for population subgroups; 5) comparative effectiveness among those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders and common comorbidities; 6) comparative effectiveness among those with bipolar disorder and common comorbidities. In this article, we describe these future research needs in detail and discuss study designs that could be used to address them.",,,5,,,
2284,"Risk and prognosis of cancer in patients with nephrotic syndrome BACKGROUND: Nephrotic syndrome may be a marker of occult cancer, but population-based studies of this association are lacking. Therefore, we examined the risk and prognosis of cancer in patients with nephrotic syndrome. METHODS: We conducted this population-based cohort study in Denmark, including all individuals diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome between 1980 and 2010 without a preceding cancer history. We computed the 5-year risk of cancer accounting for competing risk by death and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancer in patients with nephrotic syndrome relative to the general population. We compared the 5-year mortality for patients with cancer after nephrotic syndrome with that for a cancer cohort without a history of nephrotic syndrome using Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity. RESULTS: Of 4293 individuals with nephrotic syndrome, 338 developed an incident cancer during a median follow-up of 5.7 years. The 5-year risk of any cancer was 4.7% in patients with nephrotic syndrome, a 73% increased risk (SIR, 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-1.92). The association was most pronounced for lung cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. It was highest within 1 year of nephrotic syndrome diagnosis (SIR, 4.49; 95% CI, 3.68-5.42), but remained increased beyond 1 year (SIR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.17-1.53). The 5-year mortality after cancer was 68.5% in patients with cancer with nephrotic syndrome and 63.4% in the cancer comparison cohort (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.42). CONCLUSIONS: Nephrotic syndrome is a marker of occult solid tumors and hematologic malignancies and is associated with a worsened cancer prognosis. Copyright _ 2014 Elsevier Inc.

2285,"Fifteen genetic loci associated with the electrocardiographic P wave BACKGROUND: The P wave on an ECG is a measure of atrial electric function, and its characteristics may serve as predictors for atrial arrhythmias. Increased mean P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force traditionally have been used as markers for left atrial enlargement, and both have been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Here, we explore the genetic basis of P-wave morphology through meta-analysis of genome-wide association study results for P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force from 12 cohort studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 44 456 individuals, of which 6778 (16%) were of African ancestry. Genotyping, imputation, and genome-wide association study were performed at each study site. Summary-level results were meta-analyzed centrally using inverse-variance weighting. In meta-analyses of P-wave duration, we identified 6 significant (P< 5_10-8) novel loci and replicated a prior association with SCN10A. We identified 3 loci at SCN5A, TBX5, and CAV1/CAV2 that were jointly associated with the PR interval, PR segment, and P-wave duration. We identified 6 novel loci in meta-analysis of P-wave terminal force. Four of the identified genetic loci were significantly associated with gene expression in 329 left atrial samples. Finally, we observed that some of the loci associated with the P wave were linked to overall atrial conduction, whereas others identified distinct phases of atrial conduction. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 6 novel genetic loci associated with P-wave duration and 6 novel loci associated with P-wave terminal force. Future studies of these loci may aid in identifying new targets for drugs that may modify atrial conduction or treat atrial arrhythmias. _ 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,8,,,
2286,"Large-scale analyses of common and rare variants identify 12 new loci associated with atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation affects more than 33 million people worldwide and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death. Fourteen genetic loci have been associated with atrial fibrillation in European and Asian ancestry groups. To further define the genetic basis of atrial fibrillation, we performed large-scale, trans-ancestry meta-analyses of common and rare variant association studies. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) included 17,931 individuals with atrial fibrillation and 115,142 referents; the exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) involved 22,346 cases and 132,086 referents. We identified 12 new genetic loci that exceeded genome-wide significance, implicating genes involved in cardiac electrical and structural remodeling. Our results nearly double the number of known genetic loci for atrial fibrillation, provide insights into the molecular basis of atrial fibrillation, and may facilitate the identification of new potential targets for drug discovery.",,,8,,,

This study examines how child welfare caseworker role overload moderates associations between child welfare agencies' use of performance-based contracting and services provided to families. Analyses using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being suggest that when caseworkers experience high role overload, use of performance-based contracts may decrease caregivers' likelihood of receiving necessary social and behavioral health services.

2288,"Sequence variants and the risk of head and neck cancer: pooled analysis in the INHANCE consortium Previous molecular epidemiological studies on head and neck cancer have examined various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but there are very few documented associations. In the International head and neck cancer epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium, we evaluated associations between SNPs in the metabolism, cell cycle, and DNA repair pathways and the risk of head and neck cancer. We analyzed individual-level pooled data from 14 European, North American, Central American, and Asia case-control studies (5,915 head and neck cancer cases and 10,644 controls) participating in the INHANCE consortium. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for SNP effects, adjusting for age, sex, race, and country. We observed an association between head and neck cancer risk and MGMT Leu84Phe heterozygotes (OR_=_0.79, 95% CI_=_0.68-0.93), XRCC1 Arg194Trp homozygotes Arg/Arg (OR_=_2.3, 95% CI_=_1.1-4.7), ADH1B Arg48His homozygotes Arg/Arg (OR_=_2.7, 95% CI_=_1.9-4.0), ADH1C Ile350Val homozygotes Ile/Ile (OR_=_1.2, 95% CI_=_1.1-1.4), and the GSTM1 null genotype (OR_=_1.1, 95% CI_=_1.0-1.2). Among these results, MGMT Leu84Phe, ADH1B Arg48His, ADH1C Ile350Arg, and the GSTM1 null genotype had fairly low false positive report probabilities (< 20%). We observed associations between ADH1B Arg48His, ADH1C Ile350Arg, and GSTM1 null genotype and head and neck cancer risk. No functional study currently supports the observed association for MGMT Leu84Phe, and the association with XRCC1 Arg194Trp may be a chance finding.",,,3,,,

2291,"Sex differences in adult outcomes by changes in weight status from adolescence to adulthood: results from Add Health OBJECTIVE: Changes in weight status from adolescence to adulthood may be associated with varying social, vocational, economic, and educational outcomes, which may differ by sex. We studied whether there are differences in adult outcomes by sex for different weight status changes in the transition to adulthood. METHODS: Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, participants were categorized by weight status from adolescence into adulthood. We examined self-reported outcomes in adulthood for living with parents, being married, being a parent, employment, receipt of public assistance, income, and college graduation by weight groupings (healthy-healthy, healthy-overweight/obese, overweight/obese-overweight/obese, overweight/obese-healthy). The effect of changes in weight status on the adult outcomes was modeled, controlling for sex, age, parental education, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: There were differences by sex for many of the self-reported outcomes, especially educational and economic outcomes. Female subjects who became overweight/obese between adolescence and adulthood or remained so had worse economic and educational findings as adults compared to male subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, for female subjects, becoming and remaining overweight/obese was associated with worse outcomes, while for male subjects, adolescent obesity was more important than isolated adult obesity. The relationship between obesity and life situations may be more negative for female subjects in the transition to adulthood. The findings emphasize that adolescent obesity, and not just obesity isolated in adulthood, is important for characteristics achieved in adulthood. Copyright _ 2014 Academic Pediatric Association.

2292,"Mixed-effects models for GAW18 longitudinal blood pressure data In this paper, we propose two mixed-effects models for Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 (GAW18) longitudinal blood pressure data. The first method extends EMMA, an efficient mixed-model association-mapping algorithm. EMMA corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness using a kinship similarity matrix. We replace the kinship similarity matrix in EMMA with an estimated correlation matrix for modeling the dependence structure of repeated measurements. Our second approach is a Bayesian multiple association-mapping algorithm based on a mixed-effects model with a built-in variable selection feature. It models multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) simultaneously and allows for SNP-SNP interactions and SNP-environment interactions. We applied these two methods to the longitudinal systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) data from GAW18. The extended EMMA method identified a single SNP on Chr5:75506197 (p-value = 4.67 _ 10(-7)) for SBP and three SNPs on Chr3:23715851 (p-value = 9.00 _ 10(-8)), Chr 17:54834217 (p-value = 1.98 _ 10(-7)), and Chr21:18744081 (p-value = 4.95 _ 10(-7)) for DBP. The Bayesian method identified several additional SNPs on Chr1:17876090 (Bayes factor [BF] = 102), Chr3:197469358 (BF = 69), Chr15:87675666 (BF = 43), and Chr19:41642807 (BF = 33) for SBP. Furthermore, for SBP, we found a single SNP on Chr3:197469358 (BF = 69) that has a strong interaction with age. We further evaluated the performances of the proposed methods by simulations.",,,8,,,
2293,"Sensitivity to hepatotoxicity due to epigallocatechin gallate is affected by genetic background in diversity outbred mice Consumer use of herbal and dietary supplements has recently grown in the United States and, with increased use, reports of rare adverse reactions have emerged. One such supplement is green tea extract, containing the polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has been shown to be hepatotoxic at high doses in animal models. The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network has identified multiple patients who have experienced liver injury ascribed to green tea extract consumption and the relationship to dose has not been straightforward, indicating that differences in sensitivity may contribute to the adverse response in susceptible people. The Diversity Outbred (DO), a genetically heterogeneous mouse population, provides a potential platform for study of interindividual toxicity responses to green tea extract. Within the DO population, an equal exposure to EGCG (50__g/kg; daily for three days) was found to be tolerated in the majority of mice; however, a small fraction of the animals (16%; 43/272) exhibited severe hepatotoxicity (10-86.8% liver necrosis) that is analogous to the clinical cases. The data indicate that the DO mice may provide a platform for informing risk of rare, adverse reactions that may occur in consumer populations upon ingestion of concentrated herbal products.

2294,"A systems biology approach utilizing a mouse diversity panel identifies genetic differences influencing isoniazid-induced microvesicular steatosis Isoniazid (INH), the mainstay therapeutic for tuberculosis infection, has been associated with rare but serious hepatotoxicity in the clinic. However, the mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in the response to this drug have remained elusive. A genetically diverse mouse population model in combination with a systems biology approach was utilized to identify transcriptional changes, INH-responsive metabolites, and gene variants that contribute to the liver response in genetically sensitive individuals. Sensitive mouse strains developed severe microvesicular steatosis compared with corresponding vehicle control mice following 3 days of oral treatment with INH. Genes involved in mitochondrial dysfunction were enriched among liver transcripts altered with INH treatment. Those associated with INH treatment and susceptibility to INH-induced steatosis in the liver included apolipoprotein A-IV, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, and choline phosphotransferase 1. These alterations were accompanied by metabolomic changes including reduced levels of glutathione and the choline metabolites betaine and phosphocholine, suggesting that oxidative stress and reduced lipid export may additionally contribute to INH-induced steatosis. Finally, genome-wide association mapping revealed that polymorphisms in perilipin 2 were linked to increased triglyceride levels following INH treatment, implicating a role for inter-individual differences in lipid packaging in the susceptibility to INH-induced steatosis. Taken together, our data suggest that INH-induced steatosis is caused by not one, but multiple events involving lipid retention in the livers of genetically sensitive individuals. This work also highlights the value of using a mouse diversity panel to investigate drug-induced responses across a diverse population. _ The Author 2014.

2295,"Metformin and Rapamycin Reduce Pancreatic Cancer Growth in Obese Prediabetic Mice by Distinct MicroRNA-Regulated Mechanisms Metformin treatment is associated with a decreased risk and better prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism of metformin's PC growth inhibition in the context of a prediabetic state is unknown. We used a Panc02 pancreatic tumor cell transplant model in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice to compare the effects of metformin and the direct mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin on PC growth, glucose regulation, mTOR pathway signaling, and candidate microRNA (miR) expression. In DIO/prediabetic mice, metformin and rapamycin significantly reduced pancreatic tumor growth and mTOR-related signaling. The rapamycin effects centered on decreased mTOR-regulated growth and survival signaling, including increased expression of let-7b and cell cycle-regulating miRs. Metformin (but not rapamycin) reduced glucose and insulin levels and expression of miR-34a and its direct targets Notch, Slug, and Snail. Metformin also reduced the number and size of Panc02 tumor spheres in vitro and inhibited the expression of Notch in spheroids. Our results suggest that metformin and rapamycin can both inhibit pancreatic tumor growth in obese, prediabetic mice through shared and distinct mechanisms. Metformin and direct mTOR inhibitors, alone or possibly in combination, represent promising intervention strategies for breaking the diabetes-PC link. _ 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

2296,"Information-seeking behaviors and other factors contributing to successful implementation of evidence-based practices in local health departments The objective of this article was to describe factors that contribute to successful translation of science into evidence-based practices and their implementation in public health practice agencies, based on a review of the literature and evidence from a series of case studies. The case studies involved structured interviews with key informants in 4 health departments and with 4 corresponding partners from academic institutions. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, coded by 2 independent, trained coders, using a standard codebook. A thematic analysis of codes was conducted. Coding was entered into Atlas TI software for further analysis. Results from the literature review indicated that only approximately half of programs implemented in state and local health departments were evidence based. Lack of time, inadequate funding, and absence of cultural and managerial support-including incentives-are among the most commonly cited barriers to implementing evidence-based practices. Findings from the case studies suggest that these health departments, successful in implementing evidence-based practices, have strong relationships and good communication channels established with their academic partner(s). There is strong leadership engagement from within the health department and in the academic institution. Implementation of evidence-based programs was most often related to high priority community needs and the availability of resources to address these needs. The practice agencies operate with a culture of quality improvement throughout the agency. Information technology, training, how the interventions are bundled, including their complexity and ability to be customized and resource requirements are all fruitful avenues for further research.",,,7,,,
2297,"Changes in North Carolina maternal health service use and outcomes among medicaid-enrolled pregnant women during state budget cuts OBJECTIVES: The recent recession has weakened the US health and human service safety net. Questions about implications for mothers and children prompted this study, which tested for changes in maternal service use and outcomes among North Carolina women with deliveries covered through Medicaid before and after a year of significant state budget cuts. METHODS: Data for Medicaid covered deliveries from April-June 2009 (pre) and from April-June 2010 (post) were derived from birth certificates, Medicaid claims and eligibility files, and WIC (Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children) records. These time periods represent the quarter immediately before as well as the final quarter of a state fiscal year 2010 (July 2009-June 2010) characterized by substantial state budget cuts, including an October 2009 reduction in reimbursement rates for maternity care coordination. We examined how often women received medical care, maternity care coordination, family planning services, and the average numbers of obstetrical encounters, as well as the prevalence of excessive pregnancy weight gain, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. RESULTS: By the end of a year of substantial state budget cuts, women covered through Medicaid had fewer obstetrical visits in all trimesters as well as postpartum (P < .001). Maternal weight gain, preterm delivery, and low birth weight were stable. CONCLUSIONS: One key aspect of medical service use decreased for women enrolled in Medicaid by the end of a year of major state health and human services budget cuts. Maternal and infant child health outcomes measured in this study did not change during that year. Future monitoring is warranted to ensure that maternal health service access remains adequate.",,,2,,,
2298,"A Missense Variant in PTPN22 is a Risk Factor for Drug-induced Liver Injury BACKGROUND & AIMS: We performed genetic analyses of a multiethnic cohort of patients with idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) to identify variants associated with susceptibility. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study of 2048 individuals with DILI (cases) and 12,429 individuals without (controls). Our analysis included subjects of European (1806 cases and 10,397 controls), African American (133 cases and 1,314 controls), and Hispanic (109 cases and 718 controls) ancestry. We analyzed DNA from 113 Icelandic cases and 239,304 controls to validate our findings. RESULTS: We associated idiosyncratic DILI with rs2476601, a nonsynonymous polymorphism that encodes a substitution of tryptophan with arginine in the protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 22 gene (PTPN22) (odds ratio [OR] 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.62; P_= 1.2__ 10-9 and replicated the finding in the validation set (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.09-1.99; P_= .01). The minor allele frequency showed the same effect size (OR > 1) among ethnic groups. The strongest association was with amoxicillin and clavulanate-associated DILI in persons of European ancestry (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.32-1.98; P_= 4.0__ 10-6; allele frequency_= 13.3%), but the polymorphism was associated with DILI of other causes (OR_1.37; 95% CI 1.21-1.56; P_= 1.5__ 10-6; allele frequency_= 11.5%). Among amoxicillin- and clavulanate-associated cases of European ancestry, rs2476601 doubled the risk for DILI among those with the HLA risk alleles A*02:01 and DRB1*15:01. CONCLUSIONS: In a genome-wide association study, we identified rs2476601 in PTPN22 as a non-HLA variant that associates with risk of liver injury caused by multiple drugs and validated our finding in a separate cohort. This variant has been associated with increased risk of autoimmune diseases, providing support for the concept that alterations in immune regulation contribute to idiosyncratic DILI.

2299,"Associations of autozygosity with a broad range of human phenotypes In many species, the offspring of related parents suffer reduced reproductive success, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that FROH is significantly associated (p_< _0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of FROH are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in FROH is independent of all environmental confounding.",,,1,,,
2300,"Associations between placental CpG methylation of metastable epialleles and childhood body mass index across ages one, two and ten in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns (ELGAN) cohort The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis posits that in utero and early life conditions can disrupt normal fetal development and program susceptibility to later-life disease. Metastable epialleles are genomic loci in which CpG methylation patterning is responsive to maternal diet and conserved across time and tissues. Thus, these sites could serve as 'signatures' of gestational environment conditions. Here, we sought to determine if methylation of metastable epialleles was associated with changes in childhood body mass index (BMI) z-scores across ages one, two and ten in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns (ELGAN) cohort. CpG methylation of 250 probes (corresponding to 111 genes) within metastable epiallele regions was measured in placental tissue. Linear mixed effects models were fit to evaluate the overall and sex-stratified associations between methylation and changes in BMI z-score over time. In total, 26 probes were associated (p < _0.05) with changes in BMI z-score overall, including probes within Mesoderm Specific Transcript (MEST) and Histone Deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), which have previously been associated with childhood obesity and adipogenesis. Sex-stratified analyses revealed a significant association, after adjusting for multiple comparisons (q < _0.05), within female placentas for one probe annotated to the imprinted gene PLAG1 Like Zinc Finger 1 (PLAGL1). These findings suggest epigenetic marks may be involved in programming susceptibility to obesity in utero and highlight the potential to use placental tissues in predicting growth rate trajectories among premature infants.",,,3,,,

The Center provides services to strengthen MCH professionals' skills in three core areas: Change Management/Adaptive Leadership, Evidence-Based Decision Making, and Systems Integration. Description This descriptive qualitative study compares eight interview responses from a sample of the Center's participants and findings from a document review of the training curriculum against an existing framework of collaborative leadership themes. Assessment Systems thinking tools and related training were highly referenced, and the interviewees often related process-based leadership practices with their applied learning health transformation projects. Perceived barriers to sustaining collaborative work included: (1) a tendency for state agencies to have siloed priorities, (2) difficulty achieving a consensus to move a project forward without individual partners disengaging, (3) strained organizational partnerships when the individual representative leaves that partnering organization, and (4) difficulty in sustaining project-based partnerships past the short term. Conclusion The findings in this study suggest that investments in leadership development training for MCH professionals, such as the Center, can provide opportunities for participants to utilize collaborative leadership practices.",,,2,,,
2302,"Sugar-sweetened beverage taxes in Brazil OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether taxing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) would improve the diets of households in Brazil. METHODS: We used household food consumption data that the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics collected in 2002-2003 from a nationally representative sample of 48,470 Brazilian households. The consumption of SSBs is expressed as the total SSB calories consumed and as the SSB percentage of the total calories purchased. We investigated price elasticity with regression models, controlling for demographic variables, income, and prices of all other foods and drinks. RESULTS: Increases in the price of SSBs led to reductions in consumption. A 1.00% increase in the price of SSBs led to a 0.85% reduction of SSB calories consumed (1.03% reduction for the poor and 0.63% for the nonpoor). Increased income had a positive effect on SSB consumption, but the effect was less than half the size of the price elasticity (0.41% increase in SSB calories consumed for every 1.00% increase in income). CONCLUSIONS: High SSB price elasticity in Brazil indicates that a tax on purchased weight or volume would lead to reductions in SSB consumption.",,,4,,,

We used multivariate ordinary least squares linear regression models to examine the association of BPA and triclosan with CMV antibody titers, and multivariate logistic regression models to investigate the association of these chemicals with allergy or hay fever diagnosis. Statistical models were stratified by age (< 18 years and _ 18 years). RESULTS: In analyses adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index, creatinine levels, family income, and educational attainment, in the _ 18-year age group, higher urinary BPA levels were associated with higher CMV antibody titers (p < 0.001). In the < 18-year age group, lower levels of BPA were associated with higher CMV antibody titers (p < 0.05). However, triclosan, but not BPA, showed a positive association with allergy or hay fever diagnosis. In the < 18-year age group, higher levels of triclosan were associated with greater odds of having been diagnosed with allergies or hay fever (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: EDCs such as BPA and triclosan may negatively affect human immune function as measured by CMV antibody levels and allergy or hay fever diagnosis, respectively, with differential consequences based on age. Additional studies should be done to investigate these findings.",,,2,,,
2304,"Contraception and health Increasing contraceptive use in developing countries has cut the number of maternal deaths by 40% over the past 20 years, merely by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies. By preventing high-risk pregnancies, especially in women of high parities, and those that would have ended in unsafe abortion, increased contraceptive use has reduced the maternal mortality ratio--the risk of maternal death per 100,000 livebirths--by about 26% in little more than a decade. A further 30% of maternal deaths could be avoided by fulfilment of unmet need for contraception. The benefits of modern contraceptives to women's health, including non-contraceptive benefits of specific methods, outweigh the risks. Contraception can also improve perinatal outcomes and child survival, mainly by lengthening interpregnancy intervals. In developing countries, the risk of prematurity and low birthweight doubles when conception occurs within 6 months of a previous birth, and children born within 2 years of an elder sibling are 60% more likely to die in infancy than are those born more than 2 years after their sibling.

2305,"The impact of painful knee osteoarthritis on mortality: a community-based cohort study with over 24 years of follow-up OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and/or knee pain on excess mortality. METHOD: We analyzed data from 4,182 participants in a community-based prospective cohort study of African American and Caucasian men and women aged _45 years. Participants completed knee radiographs and questionnaires at baseline and at up to three follow-ups to determine knee OA (rOA), knee pain and covariate status. Mortality was determined through 2015. We used Cox proportional hazards regression with time-varying covariates (TVC) to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Additional analyses stratified by sex, race and age were carried out. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 14.6 years during which 1822 deaths occurred. Baseline knee radiographic osteoarthritis (rOA) was 27.7%, 38.8% at first follow-up, 52.6% at second follow-up and 61.9% at the third follow-up. Knee rOA with pain and knee pain alone were both associated with a >15% increase in premature all-cause mortality. In analyses stratified by sex, race and age, associations between knee pain, with or without knee rOA, and all-cause death were found among women, Caucasians, those _65 years of age, and those with a body mass index (BMI)_30, with observed increased risks of death between 21% and 65%. We observed similar, somewhat attenuated, results for cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. CONCLUSION: In models taking into account variables that change over time, individuals who had knee pain, alone or with knee rOA, had increased mortality. These effects were particularly strong among those obese. Effective interventions to reduce knee pain, particularly those including weight management and prevention of comorbidities, could reduce mortality.

2306,"Common genetic variations in the LEP and LEPR genes, obesity and breast cancer incidence and survival Obesity is a strong risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women and adverse prognostic indicator regardless of menopausal status. Leptin is an important regulator of adipose tissue mass and has been associated with tumor cell growth. Leptin exerts its effects through interaction with the leptin receptor (LEPR). We investigated whether genetic variations in the leptin (LEP) and LEPR genes are associated with risk of breast cancer, or once diagnosed, with survival. The polymorphisms LEP G-2548A and LEPR Q223R were characterized in population-based study consisting of mostly European-American women. The study examined 1,065 women diagnosed with first, primary invasive breast cancer between 1996 and 1997. Controls were 1,108 women frequency matched to the cases by 5-year age group. A modest increase in risk of developing breast cancer was associated with the LEP -2548AA genotype when compared to the LEP -2548GG genotype (age-adjusted OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.01-1.66). This association was stronger among postmenopausal women who were obese (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 0.95-3.64) although the interaction was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.07). We found no evidence of an association with polymorphisms of either LEP or LEPR in relation to all-cause or breast cancer-specific mortality among women with breast cancer (mean follow-up time = 66.7 months). The effects of these genotypes on breast cancer risk and mortality did not vary significantly when stratified by menopausal status. In summary, our results show that a common variant in LEP may be associated with the risk of developing breast cancer supporting the hypothesis that leptin is involved in breast carcinogenesis.",,,3,,,
2307,"Independent associations of socioeconomic factors with disability and pain in adults with knee osteoarthritis BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between function, pain and stiffness outcomes with individual and community socioeconomic status (SES) measures among individuals with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (rOA). METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project were analyzed for adults age 45 and older with knee rOA (n_=_782) and a subset with both radiographic and symptomatic knee OA (n_=_471). Function, pain and stiffness were measured using the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Index of Osteoarthritis (WOMAC). Individual SES measures included educational attainment (< 12_years, _12_years) and occupation type (managerial, non-managerial), while community SES was measured using Census block group poverty rate (< 12%, 12-25%, _25%). SES measures were individually and simultaneously examined in linear regression models adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), occupational physical activity score (PAS), comorbidity count, and presence of hip symptoms. RESULTS: In analyses among all individuals with rOA, models which included individual SES measures were observed to show that occupation was significantly associated with WOMAC Function (_ =2.91, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)_=_0.68-5.14), WOMAC Pain (_ =0.93, 95% CI_=_0.26-1.59) and WOMAC Total scores (_ =4.05, 95% CI_=_1.04-7.05), and education was significantly associated with WOMAC Function (_ =3.57, 95% CI_=_1.25-5.90) and WOMAC Total (_ =4.56, 95% CI_=_1.41-7.70) scores. In multivariable models including all SES measures simultaneously, most associations were attenuated. However, statistically significant results for education remained between WOMAC Function (_ =2.83, 95% CI_=_0.38-5.28) and WOMAC Total (_ =3.48, 95% CI_=_0.18-6.78), as well as for the association between occupation and WOMAC Pain (_ =0.78, 95% CI_=_0.08-1.48). In rOA subgroup analyses restricted to those with symptoms, we observed a significant increase in WOMAC Pain (_ =1.36, 95% CI_=_0.07-2.66) among individuals living in a block group with poverty rates greater than 25%, an association that remained when all SES measures were considered simultaneously (_ =1.35, 95% CI_=_0.06-2.64). CONCLUSIONS: Lower individual and community SES are both associated with worse function and pain among adults with knee rOA.",,,9,,,
2308,"The association of diabetes with breast cancer incidence and mortality in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project PURPOSE: Diabetes has been associated with increased risk of breast cancer in a number of epidemiologic studies, but its effects on survival among women diagnosed with breast cancer have been examined less frequently. Importantly, prior investigations have rarely considered the influence of factors associated with diabetes such as obesity, age at diabetes diagnosis, duration of diabetes, or diabetes treatments. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of self-reported diabetes on breast cancer incidence and mortality in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project, which includes 1,447 breast cancer cases and 1,453 controls. Follow-up data for all-cause (n = 395) and 5-year breast cancer-specific mortality (n = 104) through December 2005 were determined for case women from the National Death Index. Adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and hazards ratios (HR), respectively. RESULTS: Postmenopausal women with diabetes were at increased risk of developing breast cancer [OR = 1.35; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-1.85], as were those who were not of white race regardless of menopausal status [OR = 3.89; 95 % CI = 1.66-9.11]. Among case women, diabetes was associated with a modestly increased risk of death from all causes [HR = 1.65; 95 % CI = 1.18-2.29], an association that was stronger in women who were obese at breast cancer diagnosis [HR = 2.49; 94 % CI = 1.58-3.93]. In analyses restricted to diabetics, there was no statistically significant effect of duration of diabetes or type of treatment on breast cancer incidence or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diabetes may increase incidence of breast cancer in older women and non-whites, and mortality due to all causes.",,,3,,,
2309,"Associations of educational attainment, occupation, and community poverty with hip osteoarthritis OBJECTIVE: To examine cross-sectional baseline data from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project for the association between individual and community socioeconomic status (SES) measures with hip osteoarthritis (OA) outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed data on 3,087 individuals (68% white and 32% African American). Educational attainment and occupation were used as individual measures of SES. Census block group household poverty rate was used as a measure of community SES. Hip OA outcomes included radiographic OA and symptomatic OA in one or both hip joints. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association of each hip OA outcome with each SES variable separately, and then with all SES measures simultaneously. Associations between hip OA outcomes and SES variables were evaluated for effect modification by race and sex. RESULTS: Living in a community of high household poverty rate showed independent associations with hip radiographic OA in one or both hips (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18-1.92) and bilateral (both hips) radiographic OA (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.32-2.66). Similar independent associations were found between low educational attainment among those with symptomatic OA in one or both hips (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.91) or bilateral symptomatic OA (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.08-3.39), after adjusting for all SES measures simultaneously. No significant associations were observed between occupation and hip OA outcomes, nor did race or sex modify the associations. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that hip OA outcomes are associated with both education and community SES measures, associations that remained after adjustment for covariates and all SES measures.

2311,"Quality of family planning services in HIV integrated and non-integrated health facilities in Malawi and Tanzania BACKGROUND: The integration of family planning (FP) and HIV-related services is common in sub-Saharan Africa. Little research has examined how FP quality of care differs between integrated and non-integrated facilities. Using nationally representative data from Malawi and Tanzania, we examined how HIV integration was associated with FP quality of care. METHODS: Data were drawn from Service Provision Assessments (SPAs) from Malawi (2013-2014) and Tanzania (2014-2015). The analytic sample was restricted to lower-level facilities in Malawi (n_=_305) and Tanzania (n_=_750) that offered FP services. We matched SPA measures to FP quality of care indicators in the Quick Investigation of Quality (QIQ). We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses of 22 QIQ indicators to examine how integration status was related to individual QIQ indicators and overall FP quality of care at the facility- and client-level. RESULTS: The prevalence of HIV integration in Malawi (39%) and Tanzania (38%) was similar. Integration of HIV services was significantly associated (p_< _0.05) with QIQ indicators in Malawi (n_=_3) and Tanzania (n_=_4). Except for one negative association in Tanzania, all other associations were positive. At the facility-level, HIV integration was associated with increased odds of being at or above the median in FP quality of care in Malawi (adjusted odd ratio (OR)_=_2.24; 95% confidence interval (CI)_=_1.32, 3.79) and Tanzania (adjusted OR_=_2.10; 95% CI_=_1.37, 3.22). At the client-level, HIV integration was not associated with FP quality of care in either country. CONCLUSION: Based on samples in Malawi and Tanzania, HIV integration appears to be beneficially associated with FP quality of care. Using a spectrum of FP quality of care indicators, we found little evidence to support concerns that HIV integration may strain facilities and providers, and adversely impact quality outcomes. Rather, it appears to strengthen FP service delivery by increasing the likelihood of stocked FP commodities and achievement of other facility-level quality indicators, potentially through HIV-related supply chains. Further research is needed to assess FP quality of care outcomes across the various platforms of FP integration found in sub-Saharan Africa.",,,2,,,
2312,"Using the theory of planned behavior to explain intention to eat a healthful diet among Southeastern United States office workers Purpose To test the utility of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) for explaining intention to eat a healthful diet in a sample of southeastern United States office workers. Design/methodology/approach Participants in a worksite nutrition study (n = 357) were invited to complete an online questionnaire including measures of TPB constructs at baseline. The questionnaire included valid and reliable measures of TPB constructs: behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, control beliefs, attitudes toward behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention. Data were collected from 217 participants (60.8% response rate). We conducted confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized TPB model. Findings The model fit was satisfactory (chi-square = p < 0.0001, RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.91, TLI = 0.90, SRMR = 0.09). All structural relationships between TPB constructs were statistically significant in the hypothesized direction (p < 0.05). Attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were positively associated with intention (R-squared = 0.56). Of all TPB constructs, the influence of perceived behavioral control on intention was strongest (_ = 0.62, p < 0.001). Originality/value Based on this sample of southeastern U.S. office workers, TPB-based interventions may improve intention to eat a healthful diet. Interventions that strengthen perceived control over internal and external factors that inhibit healthful eating may be particularly effective in positively impacting intention to eat a healthful diet, and subsequent food intake.",,,4,,,
2313,"Is frequency of fast food and sit-down restaurant eating occasions differentially associated with less healthful eating habits? Studies have shown that frequency of fast food restaurant eating and sit-down restaurant eating is differentially associated with nutrient intakes and biometric outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine whether frequency of fast food and sit-down restaurant eating occasions was differentially associated with less healthful eating habits, independent of demographic characteristics. Data were collected from participants in 2015 enrolled in a worksite nutrition intervention trial (n_=_388) in North Carolina who completed self-administered questionnaires at baseline. We used multiple logistic regressions to estimate associations between frequency of restaurant eating occasions and four less healthful eating habits, controlling for age, sex, race, education, marital status, and worksite. On average, participants in the highest tertile of fast food restaurant eating (vs. lowest tertile) had increased odds of usual intake of processed meat (OR_=_3.00, 95% CI_=_1.71, 5.28), red meat (OR_=_2.30, 95% CI_=_1.33, 4.00), refined grain bread (OR_=_2.25, 95% CI_=_1.23, 4.10), and sweet baked goods and candy (OR_=_3.50, 95% CI_=_2.00, 6.12). No associations were found between frequency of sit-down restaurant eating and less healthful eating habits. We conclude that greater frequency of fast food restaurant eating is associated with less healthful eating habits. Our findings suggest that taste preferences or other factors, independent of demographic characteristics, might explain the decision to eat at fast food or sit-down restaurants.",,,4,,,

2315,"State minimum wage laws and newly diagnosed cases of HIV among heterosexual black residents of US metropolitan areas This ecologic cohort study explores the relationship between state minimum wage laws and rates of HIV diagnoses among heterosexual black residents of U.S metropolitan areas over an 8-year span. Specifically, we applied hierarchical linear modeling to investigate whether state-level variations in minimum wage laws, adjusted for cost-of-living and inflation, were associated with rates of new HIV diagnoses among heterosexual black residents of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; n=73), between 2008 and 2015. Findings suggest that an inverse relationship exists between baseline state minimum wages and initial rates of newly diagnosed HIV cases among heterosexual black individuals, after adjusting for potential confounders. MSAs with a minimum wage that was $1 higher at baseline had a 27.12% lower rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases. Exploratory analyses suggest that income inequality may mediate this relationship. If subsequent research establishes a causal relationship between minimum wage and this outcome, efforts to increase minimum wages should be incorporated into HIV prevention strategies for this vulnerable population.",,,6,,,
2316,"Initiating antiretroviral therapy when presenting with higher CD4 cell counts results in reduced loss to follow-up in a resource-limited setting OBJECTIVE: In August 2011, South Africa expanded its adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines to allow treatment initiation at CD4 cell values 350__ells/_l or less. Mortality and morbidity are known to be reduced when initiating at higher CD4 levels; we explored the impact on patient loss to follow-up. DESIGN: An observational cohort study. METHODS: We analyzed routine data of 1430 adult patients initiating ART from April to December 2010 from a Johannesburg primary healthcare clinic offering ART initiation at CD4 cell count 350__ells/_l or less since 2010. We compared loss to follow-up (_3 months late for the last scheduled visit), death, and incident tuberculosis within 1 year of ART initiation for those initiating at CD4 cell values 200 or less versus 201-350__ells/_l. RESULTS: : Half (52.0%) of patients presented in the lower CD4 cell group [_200__ells/_l, median: 105__ells/_l, interquartile range (IQR): 55-154] and initiated ART, and 48.0% in the higher group (CD4 cell count 201-350__ells/_l, median: 268__ells/_l, IQR: 239-307). The proportion of women and pregnant women was greater in the high CD4 cell group; the lower CD4 cell group included more patients with prevalent tuberculosis. Among men and nonpregnant women, initiating at 201-350__ells/_l was associated with 26-42% reduced loss to follow-up compared to those initiating 200__ells/_l or less. We found no CD4 cell effect among pregnant women. Risk of mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.84] and incident tuberculosis (aHR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23-0.85) was lower among the higher CD4 cell group.

2317,"Loss to follow-up before and after delivery among women testing HIV positive during pregnancy in Johannesburg, South Africa OBJECTIVE: HIV-positive pregnant women are at heightened risk of becoming lost to follow-up (LTFU) from HIV care. We examined LTFU before and after delivery among pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV. METHODS: Observational cohort study of all pregnant women _18_years (N_=_300) testing HIV positive for the first time at their first ANC visit between January and June 2010, at a primary healthcare clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. Women (n_=_27) whose delivery date could not be determined were excluded. RESULTS: Median (IQR) gestation at HIV testing was 26_weeks (21-30). Ninety-eight per cent received AZT prophylaxis, usually started at the first ANC visit. Of 139 (51.3%) patients who were ART eligible, 66.9% (95% CI 58.8-74.3%) initiated ART prior to delivery; median (IQR) ART duration pre-delivery was 9.5_weeks (5.1-14.2). Among ART-eligible patients, 40.5% (32.3-49.0%) were cumulatively retained through 6_months on ART. Of those ART-ineligible patients at HIV testing, only 22.6% (95% CI 15.9-30.6%) completed CD4 staging and returned for a repeat CD4 test after delivery. LTFU (_1_month late for last scheduled visit) before delivery was 20.5% (95% CI 16.0-25.6%) and, among those still in care, 47.9% (95% CI 41.2-54.6%) within 6_months after delivery. Overall, 57.5% (95% CI 51.6-63.3%) were lost between HIV testing and 6_months post-delivery.

2318,"""What they wanted was to give birth; nothing else"": barriers to retention in option B+ HIV care among postpartum women in South Africa BACKGROUND: Women initiating antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy have high rates of dropout, particularly after delivery. We aimed to identify challenges to postpartum retention in care under Option B+, which expands antiretroviral therapy access to all HIV-positive pregnant women regardless of CD4 count. METHODOLOGY: We performed 2 semi-structured interviews (SSI, n = 50) and 1 focus group discussion (n = 8) with HIV-positive women at Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre, a primary care facility in Johannesburg, South Africa, that is one of the only clinics offering Option B+ in South Africa. RESULTS: Fifty women completed the SSI before delivery, and 48 (96%) completed the second SSI within 3 months of delivery. Median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 26-34); most women worked (62%) or had worked in the previous year (18%). Postpartum women attending HIV care perceived that barriers to HIV care after delivery among other women included the belief that mothers care more about the baby's health than their own (29.2%, 14/48), women were ""ignorant"" or ""irresponsible"" (16.7%, 8/48), negative clinic staff treatment (12.5%, 6/48), and denial or lack of disclosure of HIV status (10.4% each, 5/48). Experienced barriers included lack of money (18.0%, 9/50), work conflict (6.0%, 3/50), and negative staff treatment (6.0%, 3/50). During the focus group discussion, 3 main themes emerged: conflict with work commitment, negative treatment from health-care workers, and lack of disclosure related to stigma. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a complex set of interconnected barriers to retaining postpartum women in HIV care under Option B+, including structural, personal, and societal barriers. The importance of postpartum HIV care for the mother's own health must be embraced by health-care workers and public health programs.",,,6,,,
2319,"High mobile phone ownership, but low Internet and email usage among pregnant, HIV-infected women attending antenatal care in Johannesburg We investigated mobile phone usage amongst HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal services in a primary care clinic in Johannesburg (n_=_50). We conducted a semi-structured interview and asked them about their mobile phone, Internet and email use. The median age of the women was 28 years, 36% had moved one or more times in the past year, and most were employed or recently employed, albeit earning low wages. Nearly all women (94%) reported that they did not share their phone and 76% of the SIM cards were registered to the woman herself. The median time with the current phone was one year (range 1 month-6 years) and the median time with the current phone number was three years (range 1 month-13 years). Even though 42% of the participants were from outside South Africa, they all had mobile phone numbers local to South Africa. About one-third of respondents reported Internet use (30%) and about one-fifth reported using email (18%). Overall, 20% accessed the Internet and 10% accessed email on their mobile phone. Mobile phone interventions are feasible amongst HIV-positive pregnant women and may be useful in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). Email and Internet-based interventions may not yet be appropriate. _ The Author(s) 2015 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",,,6,,,
2320,"Racial Differences in Diffusion of Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), an innovative treatment option for prostate cancer, has rapidly diffused over the past decade. To inform our understanding of racial disparities in prostate cancer treatment and outcomes, this study compared diffusion of IMRT in African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) prostate cancer patients during the early years of IMRT diffusion using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. A retrospective cohort of 947 AA and 10,028 CA patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 2002 through 2006, who were treated with either IMRT or non-IMRT as primary treatment within 1 year of diagnoses was constructed. Logistic regression was used to examine potential differences in diffusion of IMRT in AA and CA patients, while adjusting for socioeconomic and clinical covariates. A significantly smaller proportion of AA compared with CA patients received IMRT for localized prostate cancer (45% vs. 53%, p < .0001). Racial differences were apparent in multivariable analysis though did not achieve statistical significance, as time and factors associated with race (socioeconomic, geographic, and tumor related factors) explained the preponderance of variance in use of IMRT. Further research examining improved access to innovative cancer treatment and technologies is essential to reducing racial disparities in cancer care. _ The Author(s) 2015.",,,3,,,
2321,"Efficient reverse genetic systems for rapid genetic manipulation of emergent and preemergent infectious coronaviruses Emergent and preemergent coronaviruses (CoVs) pose a global threat that requires immediate intervention. Rapid intervention necessitates the capacity to generate, grow, and genetically manipulate infectious CoVs in order to rapidly evaluate pathogenic mechanisms, host and tissue permissibility, and candidate antiviral therapeutic efficacy. CoVs encode the largest viral RNA genomes at about 28-32,000 nucleotides in length, and thereby complicate efficient engineering of the genome. Deconstructing the genome into manageable fragments affords the plasticity necessary to rapidly introduce targeted genetic changes in parallel and assort mutated fragments while maximizing genome stability over time. In this protocol we describe a well-developed reverse genetic platform strategy for CoVs that is comprised of partitioning the viral genome into 5-7 independent DNA fragments (depending on the CoV genome), each subcloned into a plasmid for increased stability and ease of genetic manipulation and amplification. Coronavirus genomes are conveniently partitioned by introducing type IIS or IIG restriction enzyme recognition sites that confer directional cloning. Since each restriction site leaves a unique overhang between adjoining fragments, reconstruction of the full-length genome can be achieved through a standard DNA ligation comprised of equal molar ratios of each fragment. Using this method, recombinant CoVs can be rapidly generated and used to investigate host range, gene function, pathogenesis, and candidate therapeutics for emerging and preemergent CoVs both in vitro and in vivo.",,,1,,,
2322,"A spike-modified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infectious clone elicits mild respiratory disease in infected rhesus macaques The recurrence of new human cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) underscores the need for effective therapeutic countermeasures. Nonhuman primate models are considered the gold standard for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic countermeasures. However, MERS-CoV-induced severe respiratory disease in humans is associated with high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract, which may be difficult to achieve in nonhuman primate models. Considering this limitation, we wanted to ascertain the effectiveness of using a MERS-CoV infectious clone (icMERS-0) previously shown to replicate to higher titers than the wild-type EMC 2012 strain. We observed respiratory disease resulting from exposure to the icMERS-0 strain as measured by CT in rhesus monkeys with concomitant detection of virus antigen by immunohistochemistry. Overall, respiratory disease was mild and transient, resolving by day 30 post-infection. Although pulmonary disease was mild, these results demonstrate for the first time the utility of CT imaging to measure disease elicited by a MERS-CoV infectious clone system in nonhuman primate models.",,,7,,,
2323,"Modeling pathogenesis of emergent and pre-emergent human coronaviruses in mice The emergence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) in the last two decades has illuminated their potential to cause high morbidity and mortality in human populations and disrupt global economies. Global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates, capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission, and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures. Limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hCoV infections. Therefore, understanding how hCoV-host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hCoVs in humans. Pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hCoV-host interactions that govern pathogenesis. Notably, tractable mouse genetics combined with hCoV reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virus-host interaction networks in disease. In addition to assessing etiologies of known hCoVs, mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent CoVs. Knowledge of CoV pathogenic potential before it crosses the species barrier into the human population provides a highly desirable preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness, an overarching directive of the World Health Organization. Although we recognize that results obtained in robust mouse models require evaluation in non-human primates, we focus this review on the current state of hCoV mouse models, their use as tractable complex genetic organisms for untangling complex hCoV-host interactions, and as pathogenesis models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions.",,,1,,,
2324,"A mouse model for MERS coronavirus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel virus that emerged in 2012, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pneumonia-like symptoms and multi-organ failure, with a case fatality rate of _36%. Limited clinical studies indicate that humans infected with MERS-CoV exhibit pathology consistent with the late stages of ARDS, which is reminiscent of the disease observed in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Models of MERS-CoV-induced severe respiratory disease have been difficult to achieve, and small-animal models traditionally used to investigate viral pathogenesis (mouse, hamster, guinea-pig and ferret) are naturally resistant to MERS-CoV. Therefore, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to modify the mouse genome to encode two amino acids (positions 288 and 330) that match the human sequence in the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, making mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and replication. Serial MERS-CoV passage in these engineered mice was then used to generate a mouse-adapted virus that replicated efficiently within the lungs and evoked symptoms indicative of severe ARDS, including decreased survival, extreme weight loss, decreased pulmonary function, pulmonary haemorrhage and pathological signs indicative of end-stage lung disease. Importantly, therapeutic countermeasures comprising MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody treatment or a MERS-CoV spike protein vaccine protected the engineered mice against MERS-CoV-induced ARDS.",,,1,,,
2325,"International standards for the analysis of quality-of-life and patient-reported outcome endpoints in cancer randomised controlled trials: recommendations of the SISAQOL Consortium Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as symptoms, function, and other health-related quality-of-life aspects, are increasingly evaluated in cancer randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide information about treatment risks, benefits, and tolerability. However, expert opinion and critical review of the literature showed no consensus on optimal methods of PRO analysis in cancer RCTs, hindering interpretation of results. The Setting International Standards in Analyzing Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Endpoints Data Consortium was formed to establish PRO analysis recommendations. Four issues were prioritised: developing a taxonomy of research objectives that can be matched with appropriate statistical methods, identifying appropriate statistical methods for PRO analysis, standardising statistical terminology related to missing data, and determining appropriate ways to manage missing data. This Policy Review presents recommendations for PRO analysis developed through critical literature reviews and a structured collaborative process with diverse international stakeholders, which provides a foundation for endorsement; ongoing developments of these recommendations are also discussed.

2326,"Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies six novel loci associated with habitual coffee consumption Coffee, a major dietary source of caffeine, is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world and has received considerable attention regarding health risks and benefits. We conducted a genome-wide (GW) meta-analysis of predominately regular-type coffee consumption (cups per day) among up to 91,462 coffee consumers of European ancestry with top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) followed-up in ~30_062 and 7964 coffee consumers of European and African-American ancestry, respectively. Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW significance (log10Bayes factor (BF)>5.64) with per-allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups per day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P< 5 _ 10(-8)).Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.",,,8,,,
2327,"Integrating community outreach into a quality improvement project to promote maternal and child health in Ghana Quality improvement (QI) is used to promote and strengthen maternal and child health services in middle- and low-income countries. Very little research has examined community-level factors beyond the confines of health facilities that create demand for health services and influence health outcomes. We examined the role of community outreach in the context of Project Fives Alive!, a QI project aimed at improving maternal and under-5 outcomes in Ghana. Qualitative case studies of QI teams across six regions of Ghana were conducted. We analysed the data using narrative and thematic techniques. QI team members used two distinct outreach approaches: community-level outreach, including health promotion and education efforts through group activities and mass media communication; and direct outreach, including one-on-one interpersonal activities between health workers, pregnant women and mothers of children under-5. Specific barriers to community outreach included structural, cultural, and QI team-level factors. QI efforts in both rural and urban settings should consider including context-specific community outreach activities to develop ties with communities and address barriers to health services. Sustaining community outreach as part of QI efforts will require improving infrastructure, strengthening QI teams, and ongoing collaboration with community members.",,,2,,,
2328,"Birth location preferences of mothers and fathers in rural Ghana: Implications for pregnancy, labor and birth outcomes BACKGROUND: Maternal deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa are largely preventable with health facility delivery assisted by skilled birth attendants. Examining associations of birth location preferences on pregnant women's experiences is important to understanding delays in care seeking in the event of complications. We explored the influence of birth location preference on women's pregnancy, labor and birth outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study conducted in rural Ghana consisted of birth narratives of mothers (n = 20) who experienced pregnancy/labor complications, and fathers (n = 18) whose partners experienced such complications in their last pregnancy. All but two women in our sample delivered in a health facility due to complications. We developed narrative summaries of each interview and iteratively coded the interviews. We then analyzed the data through coding summaries and developed analytic matrices from coded transcripts. RESULTS: Birth delivery location preferences were split for mothers (home delivery-9; facility delivery-11), and fathers (home delivery-7; facility delivery-11). We identified two patterns of preferences and birth outcomes: 1) preference for homebirth that resulted in delayed care seeking and was likely associated with several cases of stillbirths and postpartum morbidities; 2) Preference for health facility birth that resulted in early care seeking, and possibly enabled women to avoid adverse effects of birth complications. CONCLUSION: Safe pregnancy and childbirth interventions should be tailored to the birth location preferences of mothers and fathers, and should include education on the development of birth preparedness plans to access timely delivery related care. Improving access to and the quality of care at health facilities will also be crucial to facilitating use of facility-based delivery care in rural Ghana.",,,2,,,
2329,"Structural and functional network characteristics and facility delivery among women in rural Ghana BACKGROUND: Health facility births contribute to the prevention of maternal deaths. Although theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that social network characteristics influence facility delivery, examination of this relationship in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. We determined whether network structural and functional characteristics were associated with, or had an interactive effect on health facility delivery in rural Ghana. METHODS: Data on mothers (n_=_783) aged 15-49_years came from a Maternal and Newborn Health Referral (MNHR) project in Ghana, and included egocentric network data on women's social network characteristics. Using multivariate logistic regression we examined the relationship between facility delivery and women's network structure and functions, as well as the interaction between network characteristics and facility delivery. RESULTS: Higher levels of instrumental support (e.g. help with daily chores or seeking health care [OR: 1.60, CI: 1.10-2.34]) and informational support (OR: 1.66, CI: 1.08-2.54) were significantly associated with higher odds of facility delivery. Social norms, such as knowing more women who had received pregnancy-related care in a facility, were significantly associated with higher odds of facility delivery (OR: 2.20, CI: 1.21-4.00). The number of network members that respondents lived nearby moderated the positive relationship between informational support and facility delivery. Additionally, informational support moderated the positive relationship between facility delivery and the number of women the respondents knew who had utilized a facility for pregnancy-related care. CONCLUSIONS: Social support from network members was critical to facilitating health facility delivery, and support was further enhanced by women's network structure and norms favoring facility delivery. Maternal health interventions to increase facility delivery uptake should target women's social networks.",,,2,,,
2330,"A qualitative study of women's network social support and facility delivery in rural Ghana Similar to many sub-Saharan African countries, maternal mortality in Ghana ranks among the highest (39th) globally. Prior research has demonstrated the impact of social network characteristics on health facility delivery in sub-Saharan Africa. However, in-depth examination of the function of all members in a woman's network, in providing various types of support for the woman's pregnancy and related care, is limited. We qualitatively explore how women's network social support influences facility delivery. Qualitative data came from a mixed methods evaluation of a Maternal and Newborn Health Referral project in Ghana. In 2015 we conducted in-depth interviews with mothers (n = 40) and husbands (n = 20), and 4 focus group interviews with mothers-in-law. Data were analyzed using narrative summaries and thematic coding procedures to first examine women's network composition during their pregnancy and childbirth experiences. We then compared those who had homebirths versus facility births on how network social support influenced their place of childbirth. Various network members were involved in providing women with social support. We found differences in how informational and instrumental support impacted women's place of childbirth. Network members of women who had facility delivery mobilized resources to support women's facility delivery. Among women who had homebirth but their network members advocated for them to have facility delivery, members delayed making arrangements for the women's facility delivery. Women who had homebirth, and their network members advocated homebirth, received support to give birth at home. Network support for women's pregnancy-related care affects their place of childbirth. Hence, maternal health interventions must develop strategies to prioritize informational and instrumental support for facility-based pregnancy and delivery care.",,,2,,,
2331,"Adolescent girls' most common source of junk food away from home Contextual factors associated with adolescent girls' dietary behaviors could inform future interventions to improve diet. High school girls completed a 7-day diary, recording all trips made. In places other than home or school they recorded the food eaten. Girls made an average of 11.4 trips per week other than to home or school. Snacks high in solid oils, fats and added sugars (SOFAS) were frequently consumed. Girls reported eating an average of 3.5 servings per week of snacks high in SOFAS at someone else's house compared to 3.0 servings per week at retail food outlets. Findings demonstrate that low nutrient foods are ubiquitous and efforts should be made to reduce their availability in multiple settings. Copyright _ 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,0,,,
2332,"Energy balance in adolescent girls: the trial of activity for adolescent girls cohort OBJECTIVES: To study correlates of change in BMI percentile and body fat among adolescent girls. METHODS: A longitudinal prospective study following 265 girls from the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) cohort measured in 8th grade and during 10 and 11th grade or 11th and 12th grade. Twice during 2009-2011 girls wore an accelerometer and completed a food frequency questionnaire and 7-day diary documenting trips and food eaten away from home and school. Physical activity, BMI, and percent body fat were objectively measured at each time point. RESULTS: Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) declined, but the change was not independently associated with changes in BMI percentile. Increased vigorous physical activity was associated with reductions in body fat. Diet was associated with both changes in BMI percentile and body fat. Girls who increased the percentage of caloric intake from snacks and desserts reduced their BMI percentile and body fat. CONCLUSIONS: Some relationships between energy balance behaviors and BMI and body composition were counter-intuitive. While it is plausible that vigorous physical activity would result in reductions of body fat, until more accurate methods are devised to measure diet, the precise contribution of dietary composition to health will be difficult to assess.

2333,"The prevalence and use of walking loops in neighborhood parks: A national study BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that the design of streets and sidewalks can influence physical activity among residents. Park features also influence park use and park-based physical activity. Although individuals can walk on streets and sidewalks, walking loops in parks offer a setting to walk in nature and to avoid interruptions from traffic. OBJECTIVES: Here we describe the use of walking loops in parks and compare the number of park users and their physical activity in urban neighborhood parks with and without walking loops. METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Study of Neighborhood Parks in which a representative sample of neighborhood parks (n = 174) from 25 U.S. cities with > 100,000 population were observed systematically to document facilities and park users by age group and sex. We compared the number of people and their physical activity in parks with and without walking loops, controlling for multiple factors, including park size, facilities, and population density. RESULTS: Overall, compared with parks without walking loops, on average during an hourly observation, parks with walking loops had 80% more users (95% CI: 42, 139%), and levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were 90% higher (95% CI: 49, 145%). The additional park use and park-based physical activity occurred not only on the walking loops but throughout the park. CONCLUSIONS: Walking loops may be a promising means of increasing population level physical activity. Further studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship.

2334,"The first national study of neighborhood parks: implications for physical activity INTRODUCTION: An extensive infrastructure of neighborhood parks supports leisure time physical activity in most U.S. cities; yet, most Americans do not meet national guidelines for physical activity. Neighborhood parks have never been assessed nationally to identify their role in physical activity. METHODS: Using a stratified multistage sampling strategy, a representative sample of 174 neighborhood parks in 25 major cities (population >100,000) across the U.S. was selected. Park use, park-based physical activity, and park conditions were observed during a typical week using systematic direct observation during spring/summer of 2014. Park administrators were interviewed to assess policies and practices. Data were analyzed in 2014-2015 using repeated-measure negative binomial regressions to estimate weekly park use and park-based physical activity. RESULTS: Nationwide, the average neighborhood park of 8.8 acres averaged 20 users/hour or an estimated 1,533 person hours of weekly use. Walking loops and gymnasia each generated 221 hours/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Seniors represented 4% of park users, but 20% of the general population. Parks were used less in low-income than in high-income neighborhoods, largely explained by fewer supervised activities and marketing/outreach efforts. Programming and marketing were associated with 37% and 63% more hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity/week in parks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The findings establish national benchmarks for park use, which can guide future park investments and management practices to improve population health. Offering more programming, using marketing tools like banners and posters, and installing facilities like walking loops, may help currently underutilized parks increase population physical activity.

2335,"Playground features and physical activity in U.S. neighborhood parks All people need to engage in routine physical activity and children require it daily. Playgrounds are settings designed for children to be physically active, yet there has been little research assessing which play elements and structures are associated with more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among both youth and adults. We conducted a national study of neighborhood parks with the goal of identifying factors that promote more MVPA. We selected a nationally representative sample of 162 parks between 3 and 22 acres in 25 U.S. cities with a population >100,000. We used direct observation to measure MVPA in 147 playgrounds during spring and summer of 2016, documented playground characteristics and assessed hours of use and MVPA by age group and gender. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and generalized linear models. The most common play elements and structures were slides and ladders (92% of parks) and swings (81%); elements supporting balancing, crawling, spinning, sand and water play were in < 30% of playgrounds. Each additional play element was associated with about 50% more users and 50% more MVPA. Spinning structures and splash pads were associated with more playground use and more MVPA. Playgrounds with signage advertising park programs and on-site restrooms had more person-hours of use, but only half the parks had restrooms and < 30% had signage. To address insufficient physical activity, upgrades to playgrounds should include restrooms, structures that support a wide variety of movements, and elements that also encourage adults to be active.

2336,"Use of neighbourhood parks: does socio-economic status matter? A four-city study OBJECTIVES: To determine if neighbourhood socio-economic status (SES) is associated with park use and park-based physical activity. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The use and characteristics of 24 neighbourhood parks in Albuquerque, Chapel Hill/Durham, Columbus and Philadelphia were observed systematically in three seasons (spring, summer and autumn), with nearly 36,000 park users observed. Twelve parks were in high-poverty neighbourhoods and 12 parks were in low-poverty neighbourhoods. In total, 3559 park users and 3815 local residents were surveyed. Park incivilities were assessed and park administrators were interviewed about management practices. RESULTS: The size and number of facilities in parks in high-poverty neighbourhoods were similar to those in parks in low-poverty neighbourhoods, but the former had more hours of programming. Neighbourhood poverty level, perception of safety and the presence of incivilities were not associated with the number of park users observed. However, programmed activities and the number of activity facilities were strongly correlated with park use and energy expended in the park. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that park programming is the most important correlate of park use and park-based physical activity suggests that there are considerable opportunities for facilitating physical activity among populations of both high- and low-poverty areas.

2337,"How much observation is enough? Refining the administration of SOPARC BACKGROUND: The Systematic Observation of Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) was designed to estimate the number and characteristics of people using neighborhood parks by assessing them 4 times/day, 7 days/week. We tested whether this schedule was adequate and determined the minimum number of observations necessary to provide a robust estimate of park user characteristics and their physical activity levels. METHODS: We conducted observations every hour for 14 hours per day during 1 summer and 1 autumn week in 10 urban neighborhood parks: 2 each in Los Angeles, CA; Albuquerque, NM; Columbus, OH; Durham, NC; and Philadelphia, PA. We counted park users by gender, age group, apparent race/ethnicity, and activity level. We used a standardized Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients to test the reliability of using fewer observations. RESULTS: We observed 76,632 individuals, an average of 547/park/day (range 155-786). Interobserver reliability ranged from 0.80 to 0.99. Obtaining a robust estimate of park user characteristics and their physical activity required a schedule of 4 days/week, 4 times/day. CONCLUSION: An abbreviated schedule of SOPARC was sufficient for estimating park use, park user characteristics, and physical activity. Applying these observation methods can augment physical activity surveillance.",,,9,,,

2340,"Antiretroviral Therapy for the Prevention of HIV-1 Transmission BACKGROUND: An interim analysis of data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052 trial showed that antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevented more than 96% of genetically linked infections caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in serodiscordant couples. ART was then offered to all patients with HIV-1 infection (index participants). The study included more than 5 years of follow-up to assess the durability of such therapy for the prevention of HIV-1 transmission. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1763 index participants to receive either early or delayed ART. In the early-ART group, 886 participants started therapy at enrollment (CD4+ count, 350 to 550 cells per cubic millimeter). In the delayed-ART group, 877 participants started therapy after two consecutive CD4+ counts fell below 250 cells per cubic millimeter or if an illness indicative of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (i.e., an AIDS-defining illness) developed. The primary study end point was the diagnosis of genetically linked HIV-1 infection in the previously HIV-1-negative partner in an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Index participants were followed for 10,031 person-years; partners were followed for 8509 person-years. Among partners, 78 HIV-1 infections were observed during the trial (annual incidence, 0.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7 to 1.1). Viral-linkage status was determined for 72 (92%) of the partner infections. Of these infections, 46 were linked (3 in the early-ART group and 43 in the delayed-ART group; incidence, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7) and 26 were unlinked (14 in the early-ART group and 12 in the delayed-ART group; incidence, 0.3%; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.4). Early ART was associated with a 93% lower risk of linked partner infection than was delayed ART (hazard ratio, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.22). No linked infections were observed when HIV-1 infection was stably suppressed by ART in the index participant. CONCLUSIONS: The early initiation of ART led to a sustained decrease in genetically linked HIV-1 infections in sexual partners.

2341,"Prevention of HIV-1 infection with early antiretroviral therapy BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy that reduces viral replication could limit the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in serodiscordant couples. METHODS: In nine countries, we enrolled 1763 couples in which one partner was HIV-1-positive and the other was HIV-1-negative; 54% of the subjects were from Africa, and 50% of infected partners were men. HIV-1-infected subjects with CD4 counts between 350 and 550 cells per cubic millimeter were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive antiretroviral therapy either immediately (early therapy) or after a decline in the CD4 count or the onset of HIV-1-related symptoms (delayed therapy). The primary prevention end point was linked HIV-1 transmission in HIV-1-negative partners. The primary clinical end point was the earliest occurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis, severe bacterial infection, a World Health Organization stage 4 event, or death. RESULTS: As of February 21, 2011, a total of 39 HIV-1 transmissions were observed (incidence rate, 1.2 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.7); of these, 28 were virologically linked to the infected partner (incidence rate, 0.9 per 100 person-years, 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.3). Of the 28 linked transmissions, only 1 occurred in the early-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.27; P< 0.001). Subjects receiving early therapy had fewer treatment end points (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.88; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The early initiation of antiretroviral therapy reduced rates of sexual transmission of HIV-1 and clinical events, indicating both personal and public health benefits from such therapy.

2343,"Sexually transmitted infections and HIV in the era of antiretroviral treatment and prevention: the biologic basis for epidemiologic synergy INTRODUCTION: HIV is a unique sexually transmitted infection (STI) that is greatly affected by other concomitant ""classical"" bacterial and viral STIs that cause genital ulcers and/or mucosal inflammation. STIs also serve as a marker for risky sexual behaviours. STIs increase infectiousness of people living with HIV by increasing the viral concentration in the genital tract, and by increasing the potential for HIV acquisition in people at risk for HIV. In addition, some STIs can increase blood HIV concentration and promote progression of disease. This review is designed to investigate the complex relationship between HIV and classical STIs. DISCUSSION: Treatment of STIs with appropriate antibiotics reduces HIV in blood, semen and female genital secretions. However, community-based trials could not reliably reduce the spread of HIV by mass treatment of STIs. Introduction of antiretroviral agents for the treatment and prevention of HIV has led to renewed interest in the complex relationship between STIs and HIV. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) reduces the infectiousness of HIV and virtually eliminates the transmission of HIV in spite of concomitant or acquired STIs. However, while ART interrupts HIV transmission, it does not stop intermittent shedding of HIV in genital secretions. Such shedding of HIV is increased by STIs, although the viral copies are not likely replication competent or infectious. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV with the combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) prevents HIV acquisition in spite of concomitant STIs. CONCLUSIONS: STIs remain pandemic, and the availability of ART may have led to an increase in STIs, as fear of HIV has diminished. Classical STIs present a huge worldwide health burden that cannot be separated from HIV, and they deserve far more attention than they currently receive. _ 2019 The Authors.

2344,"HIV treatment as prevention: how scientific discovery occurred and translated rapidly into policy for the global response In 2011 interim results of HIV Prevention Trials Network study 052, a National Institutes of Health study designed to test the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment against the spread of HIV, were reported. These results showed that in a stable relationship in which one member of the couple was infected with HIV, treatment of the infected partner with antiretroviral drugs, combined with couples counseling and condom use, resulted in a 96 percent reduction in sexual transmission of HIV-1. This finding led to the use of antiretroviral treatment as a cornerstone of HIV prevention. Independent advisory committees of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have since issued analyses that set the stage for broader use of antiretroviral agents in treatment and prevention.

2346,"Establishing HIV treatment as prevention in the HIV Prevention Trials Network 052 randomized trial: an ethical odyssey BACKGROUND: Obtaining the definitive data necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of using antiretroviral treatment (ART) to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV in heterosexual couples encountered an array of ethical challenges that threatened to compromise HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052, the multinational clinical trial addressing this issue that has profound public health implications. PURPOSE: To describe and analyze the major ethical challenges faced in HPTN 052. METHODS: The ethical issues and modifications of HPTN 052 in response to these issues were cataloged by the principal investigator, the lead coordinator, and the ethicist working on the trial. The major ethical issues that were unique to the trial were then described and analyzed in light of the published literature as well as guidances and policies. The ethical challenges that must be addressed in many clinical trials, such as those related to obtaining informed consent and making provisions for ancillary care, are not described. RESULTS: When HPTN 052 was being designed, ethical questions emerged related to the relevance of the research question itself given data from observational research and a range of beliefs about the appropriate means of preventing and treating HIV infection and AIDS. Furthermore, ethical challenges were faced regarding site selection since there was a scientific need to conduct the research in settings where HIV incidence was high, but alternatives to study participation should be available. As in most HIV-prevention research, ethical questions surrounded the determination of the appropriate prevention package for all of those enrolled. During the course of the trial, guidance documents and policies emerged that were of direct relevance to the research questions, calling for a balancing of concerns for the research subjects and trial integrity. When the study results were made public, there was a need to ensure access to the treatment shown to be effective that in some cases differed from the guidelines used at the sites where the research was being conducted. In addition, questions were raised about whether there was an obligation to notify subjects about 'unlinked' transmissions of HIV, that is, infections acquired from someone other than the designated sexual partner enrolled in the study. LIMITATIONS: The ethical issues described are limited to those discerned by the authors and not those of other stakeholders who may have identified additional issues or had a different perspective in analyzing them. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the ethical challenges faced in HPTN 052 promises to inform the design and conduct of future complex, long-term clinical trials aimed at addressing critical scientific and public health questions, where data and practice patterns emerge over the course of the trial.",,,5,,,
2347,"Antiviral agents and HIV prevention: controversies, conflicts, and consensus Antiviral agents can be used to prevent HIV transmission before exposure as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), after exposure as postexposure prophylaxis, and as treatment of infected people for secondary prevention. Considerable research has shed new light on antiviral agents for PrEP and for prevention of secondary HIV transmission. While promising results have emerged from several PrEP trials, the challenges of poor adherence among HIV-negative clients and possible increase in sexual risk behaviors remain a concern. In addition, a broader pipeline of antiviral agents for PrEP that focuses on genital tract pharmacology and safety and resistance issues must be developed. Antiretroviral drugs have also been used to prevent HIV transmission from HIV-infected patients to their HIV-discordant sexual partners. The HIV Prevention Trials Network 052 trial demonstrated nearly complete prevention of HIV transmission by early treatment of infection, but the generalizability of the results to other risk groups - including intravenous drug users and MSM - has not been determined. Most importantly, the best strategy for use of antiretroviral agents to reduce the spread of HIV at either the individual level or the population level has not been developed, and remains the ultimate goal of this area of investigation. _ 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins",,,6,,,

In the HPTN 052 randomised controlled trial, ART used in combination with condoms and counselling reduced HIV transmission by 96_4%. Evidence is growing that wider, earlier initiation of ART could reduce population-level incidence of HIV. However, the full benefits of this strategy will probably need universal access to very early ART and excellent adherence to treatment. Challenges to this approach are substantial. First, not all HIV-infected individuals can be located, especially people with acute and early infection who are most contagious. Second, the ability of ART to prevent HIV transmission in men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who use intravenous drugs has not been shown. Indeed, the stable or increased incidence of HIV in MSM in some communities where widespread use of ART has been established emphasises the concern that not enough is known about treatment as prevention for this crucial population. Third, although US guidelines call for immediate use of ART, such guidelines have not been embraced worldwide. Some experts do not believe that immediate or early ART is justified by present evidence, or that health-care infrastructure for this approach is sufficient. These concerns are very difficult to resolve. Ongoing community-based prospective trials of early ART are likely to help to establish the population-level benefit of ART, and-if successful-to galvanise treatment as prevention.

2350,"ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 polymorphisms in relation to serum adiponectin levels and BMI in black and white women Adiponectin is an adipose-secreted protein with influence on several physiologic pathways including those related to insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and atherogenesis. Adiponectin levels are highly heritable and several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in adiponectin-related genes (ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2) have been examined in relation to circulating adiponectin levels and obesity phenotypes, but despite differences in adiponectin levels and obesity prevalence by race, few studies have included black participants. Using cross-sectional interview data and blood samples collected from 990 black and 977 white women enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) from 2002 to 2006, we examined 25 SNPs in ADIPOQ, 19 in ADIPOR1, and 27 in ADIPOR2 in relation to serum adiponectin levels and BMI using race-stratified linear regression models adjusted for age and percentage African ancestry. SNP rs17366568 in ADIPOQ was significantly associated with serum adiponectin levels in white women only (adjusted mean adiponectin levels = 15.9 for G/G genotype, 13.7 for A/G, and 9.3 for A/A, P = 0.00036). No other SNPs were associated with adiponectin or BMI among blacks or whites. Because adiponectin levels as well as obesity are highly heritable and vary by race but associations with polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 genes have been few in this and other studies, future work including large populations from diverse racial groups is needed to detect additional genetic variants that influence adiponectin and BMI.",,,3,,,
2351,"Serum adiponectin in relation to body mass index and other correlates in black and white women PURPOSE: Adiponectin is a promising biomarker linking obesity and disease risk; however, limited data are available regarding adiponectin in black women among whom obesity is highly prevalent. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted to assess racial differences and correlates of serum adiponectin measured in 996 black and 996 white women enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study through Community Health Centers in 12 southeastern states from 2002 to 2006. RESULTS: Black subjects had significantly lower adiponectin levels than white subjects (median 10.9 vs 14.9 _g/mL, Wilcoxon p < .0001). Among black subjects, adiponectin was lower among overweight and obese women compared with healthy weight women but showed no clear decreasing trend with increasing severity of obesity; adjusted geometric means (95% confidence interval) were 15.0 [13.8-16.4], 11.5 [10.6-12.5], 9.7 [9.0-10.6], 11.4 [10.3-12.6], and 10.9 [9.5-12.6] _g/mL for body mass index [BMI] categories of 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-34.9, 35-39.9, and 40-45, p for trend < .0001). In contrast, among whites there was a monotonic reduction in adiponectin over increasing BMI (adjusted geometric means = 19.9 [18.3-21.7], 15.1 [13.9-16.4], 14.3 [13.2-15.5], 12.5 [11.2-13.9], and 11.0 [9.7-12.5] _g/mL, p for trend < .0001). BMI, age, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypertension were important correlates of adiponectin in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among women, racial differences exist in both the magnitude and form of the adiponectin-BMI association. Copyright _ 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,3,,,
2352,"Beverage purchases from stores in Mexico under the excise tax on sugar sweetened beverages: observational study STUDY QUESTION: What has been the effect on purchases of beverages from stores in Mexico one year after implementation of the excise tax on sugar sweetened beverages? METHODS: In this observational study the authors used data on the purchase of beverages in Mexico from January 2012 to December 2014 from an unbalanced panel of 6253 households providing 205 112 observations in 53 cities with more than 50 000 inhabitants. To test whether the post-tax trend in purchases was significantly different from the pretax trend, the authors used a difference in difference fixed effects model, which adjusts for both macroeconomic variables that can affect the purchase of beverages over time, and pre-existing trends. The variables used in the analysis included demographic information on household composition (age and sex of household members) and socioeconomic status (low, middle, and high). The authors compared the predicted volumes (mL/capita/day) of taxed and untaxed beverages purchased in 2014-the observed post-tax period-with the estimated volumes that would have been purchased if the tax had not been implemented (counterfactual) based on pretax trends. STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS: Relative to the counterfactual in 2014, purchases of taxed beverages decreased by an average of 6% (-12 mL/capita/day), and decreased at an increasing rate up to a 12% decline by December 2014. All three socioeconomic groups reduced purchases of taxed beverages, but reductions were higher among the households of low socioeconomic status, averaging a 9% decline during 2014, and up to a 17% decrease by December 2014 compared with pretax trends. Purchases of untaxed beverages were 4% (36 mL/capita/day) higher than the counterfactual, mainly driven by an increase in purchases of bottled plain water. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The tax on sugar sweetened beverages was associated with reductions in purchases of taxed beverages and increases in purchases of untaxed beverages. Continued monitoring is needed to understand purchases longer term, potential substitutions, and health implications.

2353,"In Mexico, Evidence Of Sustained Consumer Response Two Years After Implementing A Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax Mexico implemented a 1 peso per liter excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages on January_1, 2014, and a previous study found a 6_percent reduction in purchases of taxed beverages in 2014. In this study we estimated changes in beverage purchases for 2014 and 2015. We used store purchase data for 6,645 households from January_2012 to December_2015. Changes in purchases of taxed and untaxed beverages in the study period were estimated using two models, which compared 2014 and 2015 purchases with predicted (counterfactual) purchases based on trends in 2012-13. Purchases of taxed beverages decreased 5.5_percent in 2014 and 9.7_percent in 2015, yielding an average reduction of 7.6_percent over the study period. Households at the lowest socioeconomic level had the largest decreases in purchases of taxed beverages in both years. Purchases of untaxed beverage increased 2.1_percent in the study period. Findings from Mexico may encourage other countries to use fiscal policies to reduce consumption of unhealthy beverages along with other interventions to reduce the burden of chronic disease.

2354,"Evidence that multiple genetic variants of MC4R play a functional role in the regulation of energy expenditure and appetite in Hispanic children BACKGROUND: Melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R) haploinsufficiency is the most common form of monogenic obesity; however, the frequency of MC4R variants and their functional effects in general populations remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to identify and characterize the effects of MC4R variants in Hispanic children. DESIGN: MC4R was resequenced in 376 parents, and the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 613 parents and 1016 children from the Viva la Familia cohort. Measured genotype analysis (MGA) tested associations between SNPs and phenotypes. Bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide (BQTN) analysis was used to infer the most likely functional polymorphisms influencing obesity-related traits. RESULTS: Seven rare SNPs in coding and 18 SNPs in flanking regions of MC4R were identified. MGA showed suggestive associations between MC4R variants and body size, adiposity, glucose, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, energy expenditure, physical activity, and food intake. BQTN analysis identified SNP 1704 in a predicted micro-RNA target sequence in the downstream flanking region of MC4R as a strong, probable functional variant influencing total, sedentary, and moderate activities with posterior probabilities of 1.0. SNP 2132 was identified as a variant with a high probability (1.0) of exerting a functional effect on total energy expenditure and sleeping metabolic rate. SNP rs34114122 was selected as having likely functional effects on the appetite hormone ghrelin, with a posterior probability of 0.81. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive investigation provides strong evidence that MC4R genetic variants are likely to play a functional role in the regulation of weight, not only through energy intake but through energy expenditure.",,,1,,,
2355,"Bayesian posterior distributions without Markov chains Bayesian posterior parameter distributions are often simulated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, MCMC methods are not always necessary and do not help the uninitiated understand Bayesian inference. As a bridge to understanding Bayesian inference, the authors illustrate a transparent rejection sampling method. In example 1, they illustrate rejection sampling using 36 cases and 198 controls from a case-control study (1976-1983) assessing the relation between residential exposure to magnetic fields and the development of childhood cancer. Results from rejection sampling (odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, 95% posterior interval (PI): 0.57, 5.00) were similar to MCMC results (OR = 1.69, 95% PI: 0.58, 4.95) and approximations from data-augmentation priors (OR = 1.74, 95% PI: 0.60, 5.06). In example 2, the authors apply rejection sampling to a cohort study of 315 human immunodeficiency virus seroconverters (1984-1998) to assess the relation between viral load after infection and 5-year incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, adjusting for (continuous) age at seroconversion and race. In this more complex example, rejection sampling required a notably longer run time than MCMC sampling but remained feasible and again yielded similar results. The transparency of the proposed approach comes at a price of being less broadly applicable than MCMC.",,,3,,,
2356,"Incident AIDS or death after initiation of human immunodeficiency virus treatment regimens including raltegravir or efavirenz among adults in the united states Background.: The long-term effectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatments containing integrase inhibitors is unknown. Methods.: We use observational data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate 4-year risk of AIDS and all-cause mortality among 415 patients starting a raltegravir regimen compared to 2646 starting an efavirenz regimen (both regimens include emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). We account for confounding and selection bias as well as generalizability by standardization for measured variables, and present both observational intent-to-treat and per-protocol estimates. Results.: At treatment initiation, 12% of patients were female, 36% black, 13% Hispanic; median age was 37 years, CD4 count 321 cells/_L, and viral load 4.5 log10 copies/mL. Two hundred thirty-five patients incurred an AIDS-defining illness or died, and 741 patients left follow-up. After accounting for measured differences, the 4-year risk was similar among those starting both regimens (ie, intent-to treat hazard ratio [HR], 0.96 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .63-1.45]; risk difference, -0.9 [95% CI, -4.5 to 2.7]), as well as among those remaining on regimens (ie, per-protocol HR, 0.95 [95% CI, .59-1.54]; risk difference, -0.5 [95% CI, -3.8 to 2.9]). Conclusions.: Raltegravir and efavirenz-based initial antiretroviral therapy have similar 4-year clinical effects. Vigilance regarding longer-term comparative effectiveness of HIV regimens using observational data is needed because large-scale experimental data are not forthcoming. _ The Author 2017.

2357,"Estimation of the standardized risk difference and ratio in a competing risks framework: application to injection drug use and progression to AIDS after initiation of antiretroviral therapy There are few published examples of absolute risk estimated from epidemiologic data subject to censoring and competing risks with adjustment for multiple confounders. We present an example estimating the effect of injection drug use on 6-year risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy between 1998 and 2012 in an 8-site US cohort study with death before AIDS as a competing risk. We estimate the risk standardized to the total study sample by combining inverse probability weights with the cumulative incidence function; estimates of precision are obtained by bootstrap. In 7,182 patients (83% male, 33% African American, median age of 38 years), we observed 6-year standardized AIDS risks of 16.75% among 1,143 injection drug users and 12.08% among 6,039 nonusers, yielding a standardized risk difference of 4.68 (95% confidence interval: 1.27, 8.08) and a standardized risk ratio of 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.72). Results may be sensitive to the assumptions of exposure-version irrelevance, no measurement bias, and no unmeasured confounding. These limitations suggest that results be replicated with refined measurements of injection drug use. Nevertheless, estimating the standardized risk difference and ratio is straightforward, and injection drug use appears to increase the risk of AIDS. _ The Author 2014.

2358,"Copy-years viremia as a measure of cumulative human immunodeficiency virus viral burden Plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load is a valuable tool for HIV research and clinical care but is often used in a noncumulative manner. The authors developed copy-years viremia as a measure of cumulative plasma HIV-1 viral load exposure among 297 HIV seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (1984-1996). Men were followed from seroconversion to incident acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), death, or the beginning of the combination antiretroviral therapy era (January 1, 1996); the median duration of follow-up was 4.6 years (interquartile range (IQR), 2.7-6.5). The median viral load and level of copy-years viremia over 2,281 semiannual follow-up assessments were 29,628 copies/mL (IQR, 8,547-80,210) and 63,659 copies x years/mL (IQR, 15,935-180,341). A total of 127 men developed AIDS or died, and 170 survived AIDS-free and were censored on January 1, 1996, or lost to follow-up. Rank correlations between copy-years viremia and other measures of viral load were 0.56-0.87. Each log(10) increase in copy-years viremia was associated with a 1.70-fold increased hazard (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 3.07) of AIDS or death, independently of infection duration, age, race, CD4 cell count, set-point, peak viral load, or most recent viral load.

2359,"Generalizing evidence from randomized clinical trials to target populations: The ACTG 320 trial Properly planned and conducted randomized clinical trials remain susceptible to a lack of external validity. The authors illustrate a model-based method to standardize observed trial results to a specified target population using a seminal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment trial, and they provide Monte Carlo simulation evidence supporting the method. The example trial enrolled 1,156 HIV-infected adult men and women in the United States in 1996, randomly assigned 577 to a highly active antiretroviral therapy and 579 to a largely ineffective combination therapy, and followed participants for 52 weeks. The target population was US people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12%, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence limit coverage, but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage. The proposed method standardizes observed trial results to a specified target population and thereby provides information regarding the generalizability of trial results.",,,5,,,

Such scores provide the flexibility of a regression-based approach while accounting for measurement error in sociometric indicators.

2361,"Characterizing Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder: Prenatal Alcohol Exposure and the Spectrum of Outcomes BACKGROUND: The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are conceptualized as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) as the most severe. Many find it more difficult to characterize behavioral and cognitive effects of exposure on the central nervous system when physical signs are not present. In the current study, an operational definition of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was examined to determine its usefulness in discrimination of children classified as ARND based on behavior (ARND/B) and cognition (ARND/C) from children in 4 contrast groups: (i) children exposed to study-defined ""risky drinking""; (ii) children with any reported PAE; (iii) children classified as ""Higher Risk"" for developmental problems; and (iv) children classified as ""Lower Risk."" METHODS: A total of 1,842 children seen as part of a surveillance study (J Am Med Assoc, 319, 2018, 474) were evaluated for alcohol exposure and physical characteristics of FAS, and completed neurodevelopmental testing. Ninety-one were identified as either ARND/B or ARND/C and contrasted with other groups to further identify distinguishing patterns. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) was used to examine the accuracy of classification and to identify factors contributing to such classification. RESULTS: Children described as ARND/C were distinct from other groups based on cognition and behavior as well as demographic factors (e.g., age, race, SES), child characteristics (e.g., gestational age; sex), and other drug exposures, while those described as ARND/B differed only on behavior and other drug exposures. MLR models successfully discriminated ARND groups from children in other groups with accuracy ranging from 79% (Higher Risk) to 86.7% (Low Risk). CONCLUSIONS: ARND has been a subject of debate. This analysis suggests the effects of alcohol on behavior and cognition even in the absence of the characteristic facial features and growth deficiency that can be identified. The results also indicate that it may be possible to distinguish such children from those in other high-risk groups. _ 2020 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.",,,1,,,
2362,"Implementation of a pilot accountable care organization payment model and the use of discretionary and nondiscretionary cardiovascular care BACKGROUND: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) seek to reduce growth in healthcare spending while ensuring high-quality care. We hypothesized that accountable care organization implementation would selectively limit the use of discretionary cardiovascular care (defined as care occurring in the absence of indications such as myocardial infarction or stroke), while maintaining high-quality care, such as nondiscretionary cardiovascular imaging and procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intervention group was composed of fee-for-service Medicare patients (n=819 779) from 10 groups participating in a Medicare pilot accountable care organization, the Physician Group Practice Demonstration (PGPD). Matched controls were patients (n=934 621) from nonparticipating groups in the same regions. We compared use of cardiovascular care before (2002-2004) and after (2005-2009) PGPD implementation, studying both discretionary and nondiscretionary carotid and coronary imaging and procedures. Our main outcome measure was the difference in the proportion of patients treated with imaging and procedures among patients of PGPD practices compared with patients in control practices, before and after PGPD implementation (difference-in-difference). For discretionary imaging, the difference-in-difference between PGPD practices and controls was not statistically significant for discretionary carotid imaging (0.17%; 95% confidence interval, -0.51% to 0.85%; P=0.595) or discretionary coronary imaging (-0.19%; 95% confidence interval, -0.73% to 0.35%; P=0.468). Similarly, the difference-in-difference was also minimal for discretionary carotid revascularization (0.003%; 95% confidence interval, -0.008% to 0.002%; P=0.705) and coronary revascularization (-0.02%; 95% confidence interval, -0.11% to 0.07%; P=0.06). The difference-in-difference associated with PGPD implementation was also essentially 0 for nondiscretionary cardiovascular imaging or procedures. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a pilot accountable care organization did not limit the use of discretionary or nondiscretionary cardiovascular care in 10 large health systems. _ 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,7,,,
2363,"Role of pharmacy services in accountable care organizations BACKGROUND: The accountable care organization (ACO) model being adopted across the United States aims to improve patient care and reduce costs. Little is known about whether commercial ACO contracts include accountability for prescription drug spending or how ACOs are engaging outpatient pharmacies and managing prescription drug use. OBJECTIVE: To explore how ACOs are addressing drug spending and pharmacy services-a potentially important determinant of quality and total spending. METHODS: We used data from 2 waves of the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations (N_=_270), a survey completed by ACOs that were established prior to July 2013. ACO executives were asked about ACO engagement of pharmacy services, pharmacy-related health information technology capabilities, and ACO accountability for prescription drug spending._ RESULTS: Among ACOs with commercial contracts, 77% reported being held responsible for prescription spending by their largest contract. Considering all ACOs (Medicare, Medicaid, and/or commercial contracts), 45% reported at least 1 contract included prescription drug spending responsibility. Nearly half of ACOs reported a formal relationship with a pharmacy; 26% included a pharmacy within the ACO; and 19% had contracted pharmacy services. On average, compared with those that do not, ACOs that engage pharmacies have a broader range of services and provider types, commercial and public contracts, and greater experience with payment reform._ CONCLUSIONS: Management of pharmacy services and prescription spending will likely influence commercial ACO contract success. Given the broad potential impact of prescription use on overall spending and quality, payers might encourage integration of pharmacy services in ACOs through prescribing quality and prescription spending performance measures.",,,7,,,

2365,"Cancer spending and accountable care organizations: Evidence from the Physician Group Practice Demonstration BACKGROUND: Although accountable care organizations (ACOs) are rapidly being deployed in Medicare, little is known about how the model might affect high-risk, high cost groups such as cancer patients. The Physician Group Practice Demonstration, which ran from 2005 to 2010 in 10 physician groups, provides the best current evidence on the likely effectiveness of accountable care organizations for Medicare beneficiaries. Changes in cancer treatment and spending under this program may be indicative of cancer treatment under ACO payment reform. METHODS: Using Medicare fee-for-service claims data, regression analysis was used to estimate changes in payments for cancer patients using a difference-in-difference design comparing pre- (2001-2004) and post-intervention (2005-2009) trends in spending on cancer patients in PGPD participants to local control groups. RESULTS: Regression models indicate the Physician Group Practice Demonstration was associated with average Medicare spending reductions per cancer patient of $721 annually across participating sites, an annual 3.9% reduction in payments per patient. Savings derived entirely from reductions in acute care payments for inpatient stays. The Demonstration was also associated with a reduction in mortality among cancer patients. There was no significant change in the proportion of deaths occurring in the hospital. There were significant reductions in hospice use, hospital discharges and ICU days, but no reductions in cancer-specific procedures or chemotherapy. Estimates of all measures varied considerably across participating sites. CONCLUSIONS: The Physician Group Practice Demonstration was associated with reductions in admissions for inpatient care among beneficiaries with prevalent cancer, with no adverse effect on mortality. Participants in the Physician Group Practice Demonstration did not change the trajectory of spending for cancer-specific treatments. IMPLICATIONS: Inpatient care for beneficiaries with cancer may represent a significant source of potential savings for ACOs, but evidence from the Physician Group Practice Demonstration indicates that no changes were made to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or surgical procedures.",,,3,,,
2366,"Association between medicare accountable care organization implementation and spending among clinically vulnerable beneficiaries IMPORTANCE: Accountable care contracts hold physician groups financially responsible for the quality and cost of health care delivered to patients. Focusing on clinically vulnerable patients, those with serious conditions who are responsible for the greatest proportion of spending, may result in the largest effects on both patient outcomes and financial rewards for participating physician groups. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of Medicare accountable care organization (ACO) contracts on spending and high-cost institutional use for all Medicare beneficiaries and for clinically vulnerable beneficiaries. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this cohort study, 2 study populations were defined: the overall Medicare population and the clinically vulnerable subgroup of Medicare beneficiaries. The overall Medicare population was based on a random 40% sample drawn from continuously enrolled fee-for-service beneficiaries with at least 1 evaluation and management visit in a calendar year. The clinically vulnerable study population included all Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who had at least 3 Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCCs). Beneficiaries entered the cohort during the quarter between January 2009 to December 2011 when they first had at least 3 HCCs and remained in the cohort until death. Cohort entry was restricted to the preperiod to account for potential changes in coding practices after ACO implementation. Difference-in-difference estimations were used to compare changes in health care outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries attributed to physicians in ACOs with those attributed to non-ACO physicians from January 2009 to December 2013. EXPOSURES: Medicare ACOs beginning contracts in January 2012, April 2012, July 2012, and January 2013 through the Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings Programs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total spending per beneficiary-quarter, spending categories, use of hospitals and emergency departments, ambulatory care sensitive admissions, and 30-day readmissions. RESULTS: Total spending decreased by $34 (95% CI, -$52 to -$15) per beneficiary-quarter after ACO contract implementation across the overall Medicare population (n_=_15_592_600) and decreased $114 in clinically vulnerable patients (n_=_8_673_823) (95% CI, -$178 to -$50). In the overall Medicare cohort, hospitalizations and emergency department visits decreased by 1.3 and 3.0 events per 1000 beneficiaries per quarter, respectively (95% CIs: -2.1 to -0.4 and -4.8 to -1.3), and hospitalizations and emergency department visits decreased in the clinically vulnerable cohort by 2.9 and 4.1 events per 1000 beneficiaries per quarter, respectively (95% CIs: -5.2 to -0.7 and -7.1 to -1.2). Changes in total spending associated with ACOs did not vary by clinical condition of beneficiaries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Medicare ACO programs are associated with modest reductions in spending and use of hospitals and emergency departments. Savings were realized through reductions in use of institutional settings in clinically vulnerable patients.",,,5,,,
2367,"First national survey of ACOs finds that physicians are playing strong leadership and ownership roles The extent to which physicians lead, own, and govern accountable care organizations (ACOs) is unknown. However, physicians' involvement in ACOs will influence how clinicians and patients perceive the ACO model, how effective these organizations are at improving quality and costs, and how future ACOs will be organized. From October_2012 to May_2013 we fielded the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations, the first such survey of public and private ACOs.

In hip fracture patients where rehabilitation is standard of care, ACO implementation was associated with 6%-8% increases in probability of admission to a skilled nursing facility or inpatient rehabilitation (compared with home without care), and a slight reduction in readmissions. In a clinical condition where rehabilitation is more discretionary, pneumonia, ACO implementation was not associated with changes in postacute location, but episodic spending decreased 2%-3%. Spending decreases were concentrated in the least complex patients. Across all cohorts, the length of stay in skilled nursing facilities decreased with ACO implementation. CONCLUSIONS: ACOs decreased spending on postacute care by decreasing use of discretionary services. ACO implementation was associated with reduced length of stay in skilled nursing facilities, while hip fracture patients used institutional postacute settings at higher rates. Among pneumonia patients, we observed decreases in spending, readmission days, and mortality associated with ACO implementation.",,,7,,,
2369,"Hospitals participating in acos tend to be large and urban, allowing access to capital and data Relationships between physicians and hospitals have changed considerably over the past decade, as hospitals and physician groups have integrated and new public and private payment policies have created financial interdependence. The extent to which accountable care organizations (ACOs) involve hospitals in their operations may prove to be vitally important, because managing hospital care is a key part of improving health care quality and lowering cost growth. Using primary data on ACO composition and capabilities paired with hospital characteristics, we found that 20 percent of US hospitals were part of an ACO in 2014. Hospitals that were in urban areas, were nonprofit, or had a smaller share of Medicare patients were more likely to participate in ACOs, compared to hospitals that were in more rural areas, were for-profit or government owned, or had a larger share of Medicare patients, respectively. Qualitative data identified the following advantages of including a hospital in an ACO: the availability of start-up capital, advanced data sharing, and engagement of providers across the care continuum. Although the 63 percent of ACOs that included hospitals offered more comprehensive services compared to ACOs without hospitals, we found no differences between the two groups in their ability to manage hospital-related aspects of patient care.

2370,"Spending differences associated with the Medicare Physician Group Practice Demonstration CONTEXT: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently launched accountable care organization (ACO) programs designed to improve quality and slow cost growth. The ACOs resemble an earlier pilot, the Medicare Physician Group Practice Demonstration (PGPD), in which participating physician groups received bonus payments if they achieved lower cost growth than local controls and met quality targets. Although evidence indicates the PGPD improved quality, uncertainty remains about its effect on costs. OBJECTIVE: To estimate cost savings associated with the PGPD overall and for beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental analyses comparing preintervention (2001-2004) and postintervention (2005-2009) trends in spending of PGPD participants to local control groups. We compared estimates using several alternative approaches to adjust for case mix. SETTING: Ten physician groups from across the United States. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The intervention group was composed of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries (n = 990,177) receiving care primarily from the physicians in the participating medical groups. Controls were Medicare beneficiaries (n = 7,514,453) from the same regions who received care largely from non-PGPD physicians. Overall, 15% of beneficiaries were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Annual spending per Medicare fee-for-service beneficiary. RESULTS: Annual savings per beneficiary were modest overall (adjusted mean $114, 95% CI, $12-$216). Annual savings were significant in dually eligible beneficiaries (adjusted mean $532, 95% CI, $277-$786), but were not significant among nondually eligible beneficiaries (adjusted mean $59, 95% CI, $166 in savings to $47 in additional spending). The adjusted mean spending reductions were concentrated in acute care (overall, $118, 95% CI, $65-$170; dually eligible: $381, 95% CI, $247-$515; nondually eligible: $85, 95% CI, $32-$138). There was significant variation in savings across practice groups, ranging from an overall mean per-capita annual saving of $866 (95% CI, $815-$918) to an increase in expenditures of $749 (95% CI, $698-$799). Thirty-day medical readmissions decreased overall (-0.67%, 95% CI, -1.11% to -0.23%) and in the dually eligible (-1.07%, 95% CI, -1.73% to -0.41%), while surgical readmissions decreased only for the dually eligible (-2.21%, 95% CI, -3.07% to -1.34%). Estimates were sensitive to the risk-adjustment method. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial PGPD savings achieved by some participating institutions were offset by a lack of saving at other participating institutions. Most of the savings were concentrated among dually eligible beneficiaries.",,,5,,,
2371,"The genome architecture of the Collaborative Cross mouse genetic reference population The Collaborative Cross Consortium reports here on the development of a unique genetic resource population. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparental recombinant inbred panel derived from eight laboratory mouse inbred strains. Breeding of the CC lines was initiated at multiple international sites using mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Currently, this innovative project is breeding independent CC lines at the University of North Carolina (UNC), at Tel Aviv University (TAU), and at Geniad in Western Australia (GND). These institutions aim to make publicly available the completed CC lines and their genotypes and sequence information. We genotyped, and report here, results from 458 extant lines from UNC, TAU, and GND using a custom genotyping array with 7500 SNPs designed to be maximally informative in the CC and used a novel algorithm to infer inherited haplotypes directly from hybridization intensity patterns. We identified lines with breeding errors and cousin lines generated by splitting incipient lines into two or more cousin lines at early generations of inbreeding. We then characterized the genome architecture of 350 genetically independent CC lines. Results showed that founder haplotypes are inherited at the expected frequency, although we also consistently observed highly significant transmission ratio distortion at specific loci across all three populations. On chromosome 2, there is significant overrepresentation of WSB/EiJ alleles, and on chromosome X, there is a large deficit of CC lines with CAST/EiJ alleles. Linkage disequilibrium decays as expected and we saw no evidence of gametic disequilibrium in the CC population as a whole or in random subsets of the population. Gametic equilibrium in the CC population is in marked contrast to the gametic disequilibrium present in a large panel of classical inbred strains. Finally, we discuss access to the CC population and to the associated raw data describing the genetic structure of individual lines. Integration of rich phenotypic and genomic data over time and across a wide variety of fields will be vital to delivering on one of the key attributes of the CC, a common genetic reference platform for identifying causative variants and genetic networks determining traits in mammals.",,,1,,,
2372,"Ovarian cancer and body size: individual participant meta-analysis including 25,157 women with ovarian cancer from 47 epidemiological studies BACKGROUND: Only about half the studies that have collected information on the relevance of women's height and body mass index to their risk of developing ovarian cancer have published their results, and findings are inconsistent. Here, we bring together the worldwide evidence, published and unpublished, and describe these relationships. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Individual data on 25,157 women with ovarian cancer and 81,311 women without ovarian cancer from 47 epidemiological studies were collected, checked, and analysed centrally. Adjusted relative risks of ovarian cancer were calculated, by height and by body mass index. Ovarian cancer risk increased significantly with height and with body mass index, except in studies using hospital controls. For other study designs, the relative risk of ovarian cancer per 5 cm increase in height was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.09; p< 0.001); this relationship did not vary significantly by women's age, year of birth, education, age at menarche, parity, menopausal status, smoking, alcohol consumption, having had a hysterectomy, having first degree relatives with ovarian or breast cancer, use of oral contraceptives, or use of menopausal hormone therapy. For body mass index, there was significant heterogeneity (p< 0.001) in the findings between ever-users and never-users of menopausal hormone therapy, but not by the 11 other factors listed above. The relative risk for ovarian cancer per 5 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.07-1.13; p< 0.001) in never-users and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99; p=0.02) in ever-users of hormone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian cancer is associated with height and, among never-users of hormone therapy, with body mass index. In high-income countries, both height and body mass index have been increasing in birth cohorts now developing the disease. If all other relevant factors had remained constant, then these increases in height and weight would be associated with a 3% increase in ovarian cancer incidence per decade.

2373,"Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies BACKGROUND: Menarche and menopause mark the onset and cessation, respectively, of ovarian activity associated with reproduction, and affect breast cancer risk. Our aim was to assess the strengths of their effects and determine whether they depend on characteristics of the tumours or the affected women. METHODS: Individual data from 117 epidemiological studies, including 118 964 women with invasive breast cancer and 306 091 without the disease, none of whom had used menopausal hormone therapy, were included in the analyses. We calculated adjusted relative risks (RRs) associated with menarche and menopause for breast cancer overall, and by tumour histology and by oestrogen receptor expression. FINDINGS: Breast cancer risk increased by a factor of 1_050 (95% CI 1_044-1_057; p< 0_0001) for every year younger at menarche, and independently by a smaller amount (1_029, 1_025-1_032; p< 0_0001), for every year older at menopause. Premenopausal women had a greater risk of breast cancer than postmenopausal women of an identical age (RR at age 45-54 years 1_43, 1_33-1_52, p< 0_001). All three of these associations were attenuated by increasing adiposity among postmenopausal women, but did not vary materially by women's year of birth, ethnic origin, childbearing history, smoking, alcohol consumption, or hormonal contraceptive use. All three associations were stronger for lobular than for ductal tumours (p< 0_006 for each comparison). The effect of menopause in women of an identical age and trends by age at menopause were stronger for oestrogen receptor-positive disease than for oestrogen receptor-negative disease (p< 0_01 for both comparisons). INTERPRETATION: The effects of menarche and menopause on breast cancer risk might not be acting merely by lengthening women's total number of reproductive years. Endogenous ovarian hormones are more relevant for oestrogen receptor-positive disease than for oestrogen receptor-negative disease and for lobular than for ductal tumours.

2374,"Global, regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 BACKGROUND: Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. METHODS: We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. FINDINGS: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72_3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71_2-73_2) of deaths in 2016 with 19_3% (18_5-20_4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8_43% (8_00-8_67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1_80 million deaths (95% UI 1_59 million to 1_89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2_89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1_59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebro ascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. INTERPRETATION: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

2375,"Global, regional, and national under-5 mortality, adult mortality, age-specific mortality, and life expectancy, 1970-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 BACKGROUND: Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. METHODS: We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0_5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. FINDINGS: Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annuali ed rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86_9 years (95% UI 86_7-87_2), and for men in Singapore, at 81_3 years (78_8-83_7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. INTERPRETATION: Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

2377,"Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk-outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk-outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk-outcome associations. METHODS: We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46_749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. FINDINGS: In 2017, 34_1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33_3-35_0) deaths and 1_21 billion (1_14-1_28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61_0% (59_6-62_4) of deaths and 48_3% (46_3-50_2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10_4 million (9_39-11_5) deaths and 218 million (198-237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7_10 million [6_83-7_37] deaths and 182 million [173-193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6_53 million [5_23-8_23] deaths and 171 million [144-201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4_72 million [2_99-6_70] deaths and 148 million [98_6-202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1_43 million [1_36-1_51] deaths and 139 million [131-147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4_9% (3_3-6_5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23_5% decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18_6% increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was hi h SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low. INTERPRETATION: By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

2378,"Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor study 2013 (GBD 2013) is the first of a series of annual updates of the GBD. Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution. METHODS: Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol. FINDINGS: All risks combined account for 57_2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55_8-58_5) of deaths and 41_6% (40_1-43_0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87_9% (86_5-89_3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11_3 million deaths and 241_4 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10_4 million deaths and 208_1 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1_7 million deaths and 176_9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6_1 million deaths and 143_5 million DALYs, air pollution for 5_5 million deaths and 141_5 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4_4 million deaths and 134_0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa. INTERPRETATION: Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks. FUNDING Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Copyright _ 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,3,,,
2379,"Smoking prevalence and attributable disease burden in 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 BACKGROUND: The scale-up of tobacco control, especially after the adoption of the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, is a major public health success story. Nonetheless, smoking remains a leading risk for early death and disability worldwide, and therefore continues to require sustained political commitment. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) offers a robust platform through which global, regional, and national progress toward achieving smoking-related targets can be assessed. METHODS: We synthesised 2818 data sources with spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and produced estimates of daily smoking prevalence by sex, age group, and year for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We analysed 38 risk-outcome pairs to generate estimates of smoking-attributable mortality and disease burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We then performed a cohort analysis of smoking prevalence by birth-year cohort to better understand temporal age patterns in smoking. We also did a decomposition analysis, in which we parsed out changes in all-cause smoking-attributable DALYs due to changes in population growth, population ageing, smoking prevalence, and risk-deleted DALY rates. Finally, we explored results by level of development using the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). FINDINGS: Worldwide, the age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking was 25_0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 24_2-25_7) for men and 5_4% (5_1-5_7) for women, representing 28_4% (25_8-31_1) and 34_4% (29_4-38_6) reductions, respectively, since 1990. A greater percentage of countries and territories achieved significant annualised rates of decline in smoking prevalence from 1990 to 2005 than in between 2005 and 2015; however, only four countries had significant annualised increases in smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015 (Congo [Brazzaville] and Azerbaijan for men and Kuwait and Timor-Leste for women). In 2015, 11_5% of global deaths (6_4 million [95% UI 5_7-7_0 million]) were attributable to smoking worldwide, of which 52_2% took place in four countries (China, India, the USA, and Russia). Smoking was ranked among the five leading risk factors by DALYs in 109 countries and territories in 2015, rising from 88 geographies in 1990. In terms of birth cohorts, male smoking prevalence followed similar age patterns across levels of SDI, whereas much more heterogeneity was found in age patterns for female smokers by level of development. While smoking prevalence and risk-deleted DALY rates mostly decreased by sex and SDI quintile, population growth, population ageing, or a combination of both, drove rises in overall smoking-attributable DALYs in low-SDI to middle-SDI geographies between 2005 and 2015. INTERPRETATION: The pace of progress in reducing smoking prevalence has been heterogeneous across geographies, development status, and sex, and as highlighted by more recent trends, maintaining past rates of decline should not be taken for granted, especially in women and in low-SDI to middle-SDI countries. Beyond the effect of the tobacco industry and societal mores, a crucial challenge facing tobacco control initiatives is that demographic forces are poised to heighten smoking's global toll, unless progress in preventing initiation and promoting cessation can be substantially accelerated. Greater success in tobacco control is possible but requires effective, comprehensive, and adequately implemented and enforced policies, which might in turn require global and national levels of political commitment beyond what has been achieved during the past 25 years.

2380,"Estimates of global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and mortality of HIV, 1980-2015: the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 BACKGROUND: Timely assessment of the burden of HIV/AIDS is essential for policy setting and programme evaluation. In this report from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we provide national estimates of levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and mortality for 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. METHODS: For countries without high-quality vital registration data, we estimated prevalence and incidence with data from antenatal care clinics and population-based seroprevalence surveys, and with assumptions by age and sex on initial CD4 distribution at infection, CD4 progression rates (probability of progression from higher to lower CD4 cell-count category), on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality, and mortality from all other causes. Our estimation strategy links the GBD 2015 assessment of all-cause mortality and estimation of incidence and prevalence so that for each draw from the uncertainty distribution all assumptions used in each step are internally consistent. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and death with GBD versions of the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum software originally developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). We used an open-source version of EPP and recoded Spectrum for speed, and used updated assumptions from systematic reviews of the literature and GBD demographic data. For countries with high-quality vital registration data, we developed the cohort incidence bias adjustment model to estimate HIV incidence and prevalence largely from the number of deaths caused by HIV recorded in cause-of-death statistics. We corrected these statistics for garbage coding and HIV misclassification. FINDINGS: Global HIV incidence reached its peak in 1997, at 3_3 million new infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3_1-3_4 million). Annual incidence has stayed relatively constant at about 2_6 million per year (range 2_5-2_8 million) since 2005, after a period of fast decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has been steadily increasing and reached 38_8 million (95% UI 37_6-40_4 million) in 2015. At the same time, HIV/AIDS mortality has been declining at a steady pace, from a peak of 1_8 million deaths (95% UI 1_7-1_9 million) in 2005, to 1_2 million deaths (1_1-1_3 million) in 2015. We recorded substantial heterogeneity in the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS across countries. Although many countries have experienced decreases in HIV/AIDS mortality and in annual new infections, other countries have had slowdowns or increases in rates of change in annual new infections. INTERPRETATION: Scale-up of ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been one of the great successes of global health in the past two decades. However, in the past decade, progress in reducing new infections has been slow, development assistance for health devoted to HIV has stagnated, and resources for health in low-income countries have grown slowly. Achievement of the new ambitious goals for HIV enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets will be challenging, and will need continued efforts from governments and international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 2030.

2381,"Measuring the health-related Sustainable Development Goals in 188 countries: a baseline analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 BACKGROUND: In September, 2015, the UN General Assembly established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015). METHODS: We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices. FINDINGS: In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59_3 (95% uncertainty interval 56_8-61_8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85_5 (84_2-86_5) in Iceland to 20_4 (15_4-24_9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r2=0_88) and the MDG index (r2=0_92), whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r2=0_79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7_9 (IQR 5_0-10_4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10_0 [6_7-13_1]) exceeded that of the non-MDG index (a median change of 5_5 [2_1-8_9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened. INTERPRETATION: GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the health-related SDGs.

2382,"Measuring progress and projecting attainment on the basis of past trends of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals in 188 countries: an analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 BACKGROUND: The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of ""leaving no one behind"". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. METHODS: We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2_5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97_5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. FINDINGS: Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56_7 (IQR 31_9-66_8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86_8, 95% uncertainty interval 84_6-88_9), Iceland (86_0, 84_1-87_6), and Sweden (85_6, 81_8-87_8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10_9, 9_6-11_9), the Central African Republic (11_0, 8_8-13_8), and Somalia (11_3, 9_5-13_1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. INTERPRETATION: GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.

2383,"The State of US Health, 1990-2016: Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Among US States Introduction: Several studies have measured health outcomes in the United States, but none have provided a comprehensive assessment of patterns of health by state. Objective: To use the results of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to report trends in the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the state level from 1990 to 2016. Design and Setting: A systematic analysis of published studies and available data sources estimates the burden of disease by age, sex, geography, and year. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence, incidence, mortality, life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 333 causes and 84 risk factors with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were computed. Results: Between 1990 and 2016, overall death rates in the United States declined from 745.2 (95% UI, 740.6 to 749.8) per 100_000 persons to 578.0 (95% UI, 569.4 to 587.1) per 100_000 persons. The probability of death among adults aged 20 to 55 years declined in 31 states and Washington, DC from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth (81.3 years) and Mississippi had the lowest (74.7 years), a 6.6-year difference. Minnesota had the highest HALE at birth (70.3 years), and West Virginia had the lowest (63.8 years), a 6.5-year difference. The leading causes of DALYs in the United States for 1990 and 2016 were ischemic heart disease and lung cancer, while the third leading cause in 1990 was low back pain, and the third leading cause in 2016 was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Opioid use disorders moved from the 11th leading cause of DALYs in 1990 to the 7th leading cause in 2016, representing a 74.5% (95% UI, 42.8% to 93.9%) change. In 2016, each of the following 6 risks individually accounted for more than 5% of risk-attributable DALYs: tobacco consumption, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, alcohol and drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high blood pressure. Across all US states, the top risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs were due to 1 of the 3 following causes: tobacco consumption (32 states), high BMI (10 states), or alcohol and drug use (8 states). Conclusions and Relevance: There are wide differences in the burden of disease at the state level. Specific diseases and risk factors, such as drug use disorders, high BMI, poor diet, high fasting plasma glucose level, and alcohol use disorders are increasing and warrant increased attention. These data can be used to inform national health priorities for research, clinical care, and policy.",,,3,,,
2384,"Flexible expressed region analysis for RNA-seq with derfinder Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly.We present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (i) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs that permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (ii) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (iii) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations, our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete.derfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.

2385,"A new era in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: considerations for future clinical trials The past decade has seen substantial progress in understanding the pathobiology, natural history, and clinical significance of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), culminating in the establishment of two effective medical therapies. Now seems an important time to reconsider the design and conduct of future IPF clinical trials. Building on lessons learned over the past decade, we use this perspective to lay out four key considerations for moving forward effectively and efficiently with the next generation of clinical trials in IPF. These are: development of a coordinated IPF clinical trials network; establishment of expectations for early phase proof of concept studies; adaptation of late-phase efficacy trial designs to the emergence of approved therapies, and; agreement on primary end-points for late phase clinical trials. Continued progress in the field of IPF will require creativity and collaboration on the part of all stakeholders. We believe that addressing these four considerations will encourage and enable investment in this new era of drug development in IPF, and will lead to more rapid development of effective therapies.

2386,"HIV Drug Resistance Surveillance Among Jamaican Men Who Have Sex with Men Should Be Prioritized for Reducing HIV Transmission The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is highest among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica but no genotypic data are available on the virus strains that are responsible for the epidemic among this key population. HIV-1 polymerase (pol) genes from 65 MSM were sequenced and used to predict drug resistance mutations. An HIV drug resistance prevalence of 28% (minimum 13%) was observed among this cohort, with the most frequent mutations conferring resistance to efavirenz, nevirapine, and lamivudine. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed 10 times the number of linked HIV infections among this cohort than respondent reporting. HIV treatment and prevention efforts in Jamaica could benefit significantly from Pol genotyping of the HIV strains infecting socially vulnerable MSM prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), as this would guide suppressive ART and unearth HIV transmission clusters to enable more effective delivery of treatment and prevention programs.",,,6,,,
2387,"Antagonism of dsRNA-Induced Innate Immune Pathways by NS4a and NS4b Accessory Proteins during MERS Coronavirus Infection Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 as a novel etiological agent of severe respiratory disease in humans. As during infection by other viruses, host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces several antiviral pathways. These include interferon (IFN), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L, and protein kinase R (PKR). Coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, potently suppress the activation of these pathways, inducing only modest host responses. Our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to MERS-CoV and related viruses, NS4a and NS4b, during infection in human airway epithelium-derived A549 cells. NS4a has been previously characterized as a dsRNA binding protein, while NS4b is a 2',5'-phosphodiesterase with structural and enzymatic similarity to NS2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We found that deletion of NS4a results in increased interferon lambda (IFNL1) expression, as does mutation of either the catalytic site or nuclear localization sequence of NS4b. All of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication. We previously reported that, like MHV NS2, NS4b antagonizes OAS-RNase L, but suppression of IFN is a previously unidentified function for viral phosphodiesterases. Unexpectedly, deletion of NS4a does not result in robust activation of the PKR or OAS-RNase L pathways. Therefore, MERS-CoV likely encodes other proteins that contribute to suppression or evasion of these antiviral innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work. This study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between MERS-CoV and the host immune response.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the second novel zoonotic coronavirus to emerge in the 21st century and cause outbreaks of severe respiratory disease. More than 2,200 cases and 800 deaths have been reported to date, yet there are no licensed vaccines or treatments. Coronaviruses encode unique accessory proteins that are not required for replication but most likely play roles in immune antagonism and/or pathogenesis. Our study describes the functions of MERS-CoV accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b during infection of a human airway-derived cell line. Loss of these accessory proteins during MERS-CoV infection leads to host antiviral activation and modestly attenuates replication. In the case of both NS4a and NS4b, we have identified roles during infection not previously described, yet the lack of robust activation suggests much remains to be learned about the interactions between MERS-CoV and the infected host.

2388,"Impact of Game-Inspired Infographics on User Engagement and Information Processing in an eHealth Program BACKGROUND: Online interventions providing individual health behavior assessment should deliver feedback in a way that is both understandable and engaging. This study focused on the potential for infographics inspired by the aesthetics of game design to contribute to these goals. OBJECTIVE: We conducted formative research to test game-inspired infographics against more traditional displays (eg, text-only, column chart) for conveying a behavioral goal and an individual's behavior relative to the goal. We explored the extent to which the display type would influence levels of engagement and information processing. METHODS: Between-participants experiments compared game-inspired infographics with traditional formats in terms of outcomes related to information processing (eg, comprehension, cognitive load) and engagement (eg, attitudes toward the information, emotional tone). We randomly assigned participants (N=1162) to an experiment in 1 of 6 modules (tobacco use, alcohol use, vegetable consumption, fruit consumption, physical activity, and weight management). RESULTS: In the tobacco module, a game-inspired format (scorecard) was compared with text-only; there were no differences in attitudes and emotional tone, but the scorecard outperformed text-only on comprehension (P=.004) and decreased cognitive load (P=.006). For the other behaviors, we tested 2 game-inspired formats (scorecard, progress bar) and a traditional column chart; there were no differences in comprehension, but the progress bar outperformed the other formats on attitudes and emotional tone (P< .001 for all contrasts). CONCLUSIONS: Across modules, a game-inspired infographic showed potential to outperform a traditional format for some study outcomes while not underperforming on other outcomes. Overall, findings support the use of game-inspired infographics in behavioral assessment feedback to enhance comprehension and engagement, which may lead to greater behavior change.",,,4,,,
2389,"Novel genetic loci identified for the pathophysiology of childhood obesity in the Hispanic population Genetic variants responsible for susceptibility to obesity and its comorbidities among Hispanic children have not been identified. The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to genetically map childhood obesity and associated biological processes in the Hispanic population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) entailed genotyping 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium technology in 815 children. Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet, energy expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). Salient findings include a nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513) in INADL (p = 1.2E-07) for weight; an intronic variant in MTNR1B associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08); variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08); an intronic variant in PCSK2 associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08); a block of 23 SNPs in XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09); a nonsynonymous SNP (p = 1.3E-21), an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC identified for MCP-1; an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08); and, after adjusting for body weight, variants in MATK for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) and in CHRNA3 for sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08).

2390,"A national strategy to develop pragmatic clinical trials infrastructure An important challenge in comparative effectiveness research is the lack of infrastructure to support pragmatic clinical trials, which compare interventions in usual practice settings and subjects. These trials present challenges that differ from those of classical efficacy trials, which are conducted under ideal circumstances, in patients selected for their suitability, and with highly controlled protocols. In 2012, we launched a 1-year learning network to identify high-priority pragmatic clinical trials and to deploy research infrastructure through the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium that could be used to launch and sustain them. The network and infrastructure were initiated as a learning ground and shared resource for investigators and communities interested in developing pragmatic clinical trials. We followed a three-stage process of developing the network, prioritizing proposed trials, and implementing learning exercises that culminated in a 1-day network meeting at the end of the year. The year-long project resulted in five recommendations related to developing the network, enhancing community engagement, addressing regulatory challenges, advancing information technology, and developing research methods. The recommendations can be implemented within 24 months and are designed to lead toward a sustained national infrastructure for pragmatic trials. _ 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,2,,,
2391,"Longitudinal changes in symptom cluster membership in inflammatory bowel disease PURPOSE: To describe changes in symptom cluster membership over 1 year and to examine which demographic and clinical factors predict changes in symptom cluster membership among adults with inflammatory bowel disease. DESIGN: A retrospective longitudinal study of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America Partners Cohort from 2012 to 2015. METHODS: We measured symptoms of pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. We used latent transition analysis to describe changes in symptom cluster membership (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months) and multinomial regressions to examine factors associated with symptom cluster membership transition. FINDINGS: Four groups were identified (N = 5,296): high symptom burden (32.3%-35.3%), low symptom burden (24.2%-27.1%), physical symptoms (19.0%-20.9%; pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance), and psychological symptoms (20.0%-21.5%; depression, anxiety). The probability of staying in the same group was .814 to .905. Moving from active disease into remission was associated with moving from the high burden to low burden and psychological symptom groups. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom cluster membership was quite stable over 1 year. Research is needed to understand the underlying etiology of symptom clusters better and to develop interventions to reduce symptom burden in this vulnerable population. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Careful consideration of symptom management options should be done with patients to select options that are effective and potentially target multiple symptoms. _ 2018 Sigma Theta Tau International.",,,1,,,
2392,"Symptom clusters in adults with inflammatory bowel disease Symptoms (pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are associated with reduced quality of life. Understanding how IBD symptoms cluster and the clinical and demographic factors associated with symptom clusters will enable focused development of symptom management interventions. The study purposes were to (i) identify symptom cluster membership among adults with IBD and (ii) examine associations between demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education) and clinical factors (smoking status, time since diagnosis, medication type, IBD type, disease activity), and membership in specific symptom cluster groups. We conducted a retrospective study of data from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America's (CCFA) Partners Cohort and used Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures to measure pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression. The sample included 5,296 participants with IBD (mean age 44, 72% female). In latent class analysis (LCA), four groups of participants were identified based on symptoms: ""low symptom burden"" (26% of sample), ""high symptom burden"" (38%), ""physical symptoms"" (22%), and ""psychological symptoms"" (14%). In multinomial regression, female gender, smoking, corticosteroids, Crohn's disease, and active disease state were associated with membership in the high symptom burden group. Additional research is needed to test interventions that may be effective at reducing symptom burden for individuals with IBD. _ 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,1,,,
2393,"Using the question-behavior effect to promote disease prevention behaviors: two randomized controlled trials OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of interventions based on the question-behavior effect in promoting the adoption of disease prevention behaviors. DESIGN: In Study 1, adults from the general public were randomly allocated to complete a questionnaire about health checks (question-behavior effect condition) or not (control) and later received an invitation to attend for screening. In Study 2, health care professionals were randomly allocated to complete a questionnaire about influenza vaccination or not and later had the opportunity to receive a vaccination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We objectively assessed health check attendance (Study 1) and influenza vaccination (Study 2). RESULTS: In Study 1, intention-to-treat analyses indicated that health check attendance was significantly higher in the question-behavior effect condition (68.3%) compared with the control condition (53.5%). In Study 2, intention-to-treat analyses indicated that influenza vaccination was significantly higher among participants in the question-behavior effect condition (42.0%) compared with the control condition (36.3%), and this effect persisted after controlling for demographic variables. Explanatory analyses indicated that the effects in both studies were attributable to completing rather than merely receiving the questionnaire and were stronger for those with positive attitudes or intentions about the target behavior. CONCLUSION: The question-behavior effect represents a simple, cost-effective means to increase disease prevention behaviors among the general public and health professionals. Implications for promoting health behaviors are discussed. (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved.",,,0,,,
2394,"Some feelings are more important: cognitive attitudes, affective attitudes, anticipated affect, and blood donation OBJECTIVE: The present research assessed the simultaneous effects of four attitude variables (cognitive attitudes, affective attitudes, anticipated negative affective reactions, and anticipated positive affective reactions) in the context of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) on blood-donation intentions and behavior. METHODS: Experienced blood donors (N = 1108) completed questionnaires measuring attitude variables plus components of the TPB and a measure of attitudinal ambivalence in relation to giving blood again in the next six months. Records were used to assess whether participants subsequently donated blood again in the six months after completing the questionnaire. The main outcome measures were objectively assessed blood donation and intentions to make an additional donation of blood. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported a distinction between cognitive attitudes about giving blood, affective attitudes about giving blood, anticipated negative affective reactions about not giving blood, and anticipated positive affective reactions about giving blood. Multiple regression analyses indicated that perceived behavioral control, anticipated negative affective reactions, cognitive attitude, anticipated positive affective reactions and subjective norms were significant simultaneous predictors of intentions to donate blood. Logistic regression analyses indicated that intentions, perceived behavioral control, and anticipated positive affective reactions were significant, simultaneous predictors of blood donation. Attitudinal ambivalence significantly moderated the effects of cognitive attitudes on intentions, and the effects of anticipated negative affective reactions on both intentions and donation behavior. CONCLUSION: The findings point to the value of considering different types of attitudes, and anticipated negative affective reaction in particular, for predicting health behaviors.

2395,"Genetic diversity and association studies in US hispanic/latino populations: applications in the hispanic community health study/study of latinos US Hispanic/Latino individuals are diverse in genetic ancestry, culture, and environmental exposures. Here, we characterized and controlled for this diversity in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We simultaneously estimated population-structure principal components (PCs) robust to familial relatedness and pairwise kinship coefficients (KCs) robust to population structure, admixture, and Hardy-Weinberg departures. The PCs revealed substantial genetic differentiation within and among six self-identified background groups (Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Central and South American). To control for variation among groups, we developed a multi-dimensional clustering method to define a ""genetic-analysis group"" variable that retains many properties of self-identified background while achieving substantially greater genetic homogeneity within groups and including participants with non-specific self-identification. In GWASs of 22 biomedical traits, we used a linear mixed model (LMM) including pairwise empirical KCs to account for familial relatedness, PCs for ancestry, and genetic-analysis groups for additional group-associated effects. Including the genetic-analysis group as a covariate accounted for significant trait variation in 8 of 22 traits, even after we fit 20 PCs. Additionally, genetic-analysis groups had significant heterogeneity of residual variance for 20 of 22_traits, and modeling this heteroscedasticity within the LMM reduced genomic inflation for 19 traits. Furthermore, fitting an LMM_that utilized a genetic-analysis group rather than a self-identified background group achieved higher power to detect previously reported associations. We expect that the methods applied here will be useful in other studies with multiple ethnic groups, admixture, and relatedness. Copyright _ 2016 The American Society of Human Genetics.

2396,"Classifying medical histories in US Medicare beneficiaries using fixed vs all-available look-back approaches PURPOSE: Evaluate use of fixed and all-available look-backs to identify eligibility criteria and confounders among Medicare beneficiaries. METHODS: We identified outpatient visits (2007-2012) with recently documented (_180_days) cardiovascular risk and classified patients according to whether the exposure (statin) was initiated within 14_days. We selected each beneficiary's first eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during the respective look-backs: continuous enrollment (1 or 3_years for fixed look-back; 180_days for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. We estimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (HRs) for the effect of statin initiation on incident 6-month cancer (a known null effect) and 2-year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using each look-back. RESULTS: Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated HR from the all-available approach (HR_=_0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98) was less biased than the 1-year look-back (HR_=_0.79, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.84), which included beneficiaries with prevalent cancer. The 3-year look-back (HR_=_1.05, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.21) was somewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due the exclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuous enrollment (62.0% and 59.9% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). All approaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality. Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding. CONCLUSIONS: The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the 3-year fixed, which produced the least biased point estimate. If 3-year look-backs are infeasible (eg, due to power/sample), all-available look-backs may be preferable to short (1-year) fixed look-backs. Copyright _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,5,,,
2397,"Sexual orientation and sex differences in socioeconomic status: a population-based investigation in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental contributor to health; however, limited research has examined sexual orientation differences in SES. METHODS: 2008-2009 data from 14_051 participants (ages 24-32 years) in the US-based, representative, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health were analysed using multivariable regressions that adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, childhood SES, urbanicity and Census region, separately for females and males. Modification by racial minority status (black or Latino vs white, non-Hispanic) was also explored. RESULTS: Among females, sexual minorities (SM) (10.5% of females) were less likely to graduate college, and were more likely to be unemployed, poor/near__oor, to receive public assistance and to report economic hardship and lower social status than heterosexuals. Adjusting for education attenuated many of these differences. Among males, SM (4.2% of males) were more likely than heterosexuals to be college graduates; however, they also had lower personal incomes. Lower rates of homeownership were observed among SM, particularly racial minority SM females. For males, household poverty patterns differed by race-ethnicity: among racial minority males, SM were more likely than heterosexuals to be living at >400%__ederal poverty level), whereas the pattern was reversed among whites. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minorities, especially females, are of lower SES than their heterosexual counterparts. SES should be considered a potential mediator of SM stigma on health. Studies of public policies that may produce, as well as mitigate, observed SES inequities, are warranted. _ Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

2398,"Food insecurity and violence in a prospective cohort of women at risk for or living with HIV in the U.S BACKGROUND: Food insecurity and violence are two major public health issues facing U.S. women. The link between food insecurity and violence has received little attention, particularly regarding the temporal ordering of events. The present study used data from the Women's Interagency Human Immunodeficiency Virus Study to investigate the longitudinal association of food insecurity and violence in a cohort of women at risk for or living with HIV. METHODS: Study participants completed six assessments from 2013-16 on food insecurity (operationalized as marginal, low, and very low food security) and violence (sexual or physical, and psychological). We used multi-level logistic regression, controlling for visits (level 1) nested within individuals (level 2), to estimate the association of experiencing violence. RESULTS: Among 2,343 women (8,528 visits), we found that victims of sexual or physical violence (odds ratio = 3.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.88, 5.19) and psychological violence (odds ratio = 3.00; 95% confidence interval: 1.67, 5.50) were more likely to report very low food security. The odds of experiencing violence were higher for women with very low food security at both the current and previous visit as compared to only the current visit. HIV status did not modify these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity was strongly associated with violence, and women exposed to persistent food insecurity were even more likely to experience violence. Food programs and policy must consider persistent exposure to food insecurity, and interpersonal harms faced by food insecure women, such as violence.",,,6,,,
2399,"""He Told Me to Check My Health"": A Qualitative Exploration of Social Network Influence on Men's HIV Testing Behavior and HIV Self-Testing Willingness in Tanzania Men continue to test for HIV at a low rate in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent quantitative evidence from sub-Saharan Africa indicates that encouragement to test for HIV from men's network members is associated with higher previous HIV testing and HIV self-testing (HIVST) willingness. Leveraging this positive network influence to promote HIVST among men is a promising strategy that could increase HIV testing. This study investigated the reasons and strategies men used to encourage their peers to test for HIV and the outcomes in order to inform the development of a social network-based HIVST intervention for men called STEP (Self-Testing Education and Promotion). Twenty-three men from networks locally referred to as ""camps"" were interviewed to explore reasons for encouraging HIV testing, strategies to encourage HIV testing, and outcomes of HIV testing encouragement. Reasons men reported for encouraging their peers to test for HIV included awareness of their peers' risky sexual behavior, knowing an HIV-positive peer, and having HIV testing experience. Strategies for encouraging testing included engaging in formal and informal conversations and accompanying friends to the clinic. Encouragement outcomes included HIV testing for some men while others remained untested due to lack of privacy in the clinic and fear of HIV stigma. Willingness to self-test for HIV and an interest to educate peers about HIVST were other outcomes of HIV testing encouragement. These findings underscore the potential of leveraging men's existing HIV testing encouragement strategies to promote HIVST among their peers.",,,6,,,
2400,"Sexual and Social Network Correlates of Willingness to Self-Test for HIV Among Ever-Tested and Never-Tested Men: Implications for the Tanzania STEP Project We examined factors associated with HIV self-testing (HIVST) willingness among male ever-testers and never-testers who participated in a midpoint survey of a cluster randomized controlled HIV prevention trial in Dar es Salaam. Linear mixed binary logistic regression models were constructed to examine factors (demographic, HIV risk behavior, and sexual/social network) associated with willingness to self-test. Sixtyseven percent of 301 never-testers were willing to self-test for HIV compared to 72% 577 of ever-testers. Among never-testers, having discussed testing for HIV with a sexual partner was the only factor associated with HIVST willingness (2.36, 95% CI: 1.35-4.15). For evertesters, younger men were less willing to self-test than older men while men with higher education were more willing to self-test than less educated men. Having a moderate/great HIV risk perception decreased the odds of HIVST willingness relative to no risk perception (0.40, 95% CI 0.23-0.70) for ever-testers. Discussing HIV testing with a sexual partner and having been encouraged to test for HIV by a friend were associated with higher odds of being willing to self-test (2.22, 2.23; 95% CI 1.34-3.67, 1.14-4.39, respectively) among ever-testers. These findings suggest that HIVST willingness is highly acceptable among both male ever-testers and never-testers.",,,6,,,
2401,"Systematic review of mobile health behavioural interventions to improve uptake of HIV testing for vulnerable and key populations Introduction This systematic narrative review examined the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) behavioural interventions designed to increase the uptake of HIV testing among vulnerable and key populations. Methods MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Global Health electronic databases were searched. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published between 2005 and 2015, evaluated an mHealth intervention, and reported an outcome relating to HIV testing. We also reviewed the bibliographies of retrieved studies for other relevant citations. The methodological rigor of selected articles was assessed, and narrative analyses were used to synthesize findings from mixed methodologies. Results A total of seven articles met the inclusion criteria. Most mHealth interventions employed a text-messaging feature and were conducted in middle- and high-income countries. The methodological rigor was moderate among studies. The current literature suggests that mHealth interventions can have significant positive effects on HIV testing initiation among vulnerable and key populations, as well as the general public. In some cases, null results were observed. Qualitative themes relating to the use of mobile technologies to increase HIV testing included the benefits of having low-cost, confidential, and motivational communication. Reported barriers included cellular network restrictions, poor linkages with physical testing services, and limited knowledge of appropriate text-messaging dose. Discussion MHealth interventions may prove beneficial in reducing the proportion of undiagnosed persons living with HIV, particularly among vulnerable and key populations. However, more rigorous and tailored interventions are needed to assess the effectiveness of widespread use.",,,7,,,

Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 men in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania who socialize in networks locally referred to as ""camps"". Men reported privacy, confidentiality, and saving time as the primary reasons for their self-testing interest. Most participants had high perceived control and self-efficacy to self-test and seek confirmatory HIV testing. Nevertheless, men reported concerns related to their ability to perform the test and the potential lack of post-test counseling. Specific recommendations for the intervention included providing HIVST education and pre-test counseling, and using mobile health (mHealth) strategies for participants to reach a healthcare professional for further assistance. The findings suggest that while HIVST is highly acceptable among men in Tanzania, future interventions will need to address the challenges that men may face with HIVST before promoting it as an alternative or supplement to facility-based HIV testing.",,,6,,,

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation.

2404,"Large-scale gene-centric analysis identifies novel variants for coronary artery disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a significant genetic contribution that is incompletely characterized. To complement genome-wide association (GWA) studies, we conducted a large and systematic candidate gene study of CAD susceptibility, including analysis of many uncommon and functional variants. We examined 49,094 genetic variants in _2,100 genes of cardiovascular relevance, using a customised gene array in 15,596 CAD cases and 34,992 controls (11,202 cases and 30,733 controls of European descent; 4,394 cases and 4,259 controls of South Asian origin). We attempted to replicate putative novel associations in an additional 17,121 CAD cases and 40,473 controls. Potential mechanisms through which the novel variants could affect CAD risk were explored through association tests with vascular risk factors and gene expression. We confirmed associations of several previously known CAD susceptibility loci (eg, 9p21.3:p< 10(-33); LPA:p< 10(-19); 1p13.3:p< 10(-17)) as well as three recently discovered loci (COL4A1/COL4A2, ZC3HC1, CYP17A1:p< 5_10(-7)). However, we found essentially null results for most previously suggested CAD candidate genes. In our replication study of 24 promising common variants, we identified novel associations of variants in or near LIPA, IL5, TRIB1, and ABCG5/ABCG8, with per-allele odds ratios for CAD risk with each of the novel variants ranging from 1.06-1.09. Associations with variants at LIPA, TRIB1, and ABCG5/ABCG8 were supported by gene expression data or effects on lipid levels. Apart from the previously reported variants in LPA, none of the other _4,500 low frequency and functional variants showed a strong effect. Associations in South Asians did not differ appreciably from those in Europeans, except for 9p21.3 (per-allele odds ratio: 1.14 versus 1.27 respectively; P for heterogeneity_=_0.003).

2405,"Two novel susceptibility loci for prostate cancer in men of african ancestry Prostate cancer incidence is 1.6-fold higher in African Americans than in other populations. The risk factors that drive this disparity are unknown and potentially consist of social, environmental, and genetic influences. To investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis using two-sided statistical tests in 10_202 case subjects and 10_810 control subjects. We identified novel signals on chromosomes 13q34 and 22q12, with the risk-associated alleles found only in men of African ancestry (13q34: rs75823044, risk allele frequency = 2.2%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37 to 1.76, P = 6.10___10-12; 22q12.1: rs78554043, risk allele frequency = 1.5%, OR_=_1.62, 95% CI_=_1.39 to 1.89, P = 7.50___10-10). At 13q34, the signal is located 5' of the gene IRS2 and 3' of a long noncoding RNA, while at 22q12 the candidate functional allele is a missense variant in the CHEK2 gene.

2406,"The impact of a cartoon character on adults perceptions of Children's breakfast cereals: a randomized experiment BACKGROUND: Cartoon characters on processed food packaging increase the perception of product preference among children, but their effect among adults has rarely been examined. We evaluated the effect of a cartoon character on breakfast cereals on beliefs about buying them for children, as well as whether demographic characteristics modified this effect. METHODS: An experimental study was conducted with adults from online consumer panels in Mexico (n_=_3755). Participants were randomly assigned to a ""cartoon"" condition (n_=_1789), in which they viewed a breakfast cereal box with a Minion character on the front of the package, or the ""control"" condition (n_=_1966), in which the same cereal box was displayed with no character on the package. Participants were asked: ""Is this a good cereal to buy children?"" with the response options ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Don't know"". Multinomial adjusted logistic models regressed responses to this question (Yes_=_0, No_=_1, 2_=__on't know) on experimental condition. Differences in the effect of the cartoon character across demographic characteristics were tested by introducing multiplicative interaction terms. RESULTS: The adjusted model showed that participants in the ""cartoon character"" condition were 1.67 (1.45-1.94) times more likely to consider the cereal as being ""Not good to buy for children"" than those in the control condition (p_< _0.001). This effect was smaller among parents (RRR_=_1.39, 1.13-1.72) compared to those without children (RRR_=_2.01, 1.63-2.47). No differences were observed in the proportion of participants answering ""Don't know"" across experimental groups. CONCLUSION: Among this sample of Mexican adults, a cereal with a cartoon character on the packaging was more often perceived as ""not good to buy for children"" compared to a cereal without it. This effect was smaller among parents, potentially due to children influences of parental decisions during food purchasing.",,,5,,,
2407,"Correlation between quantitative PCR and culture-based methods for measuring Enterococcus spp. over various temporal scales at three California marine beaches Several studies have examined how fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) measurements compare between quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the culture methods it is intended to replace. Here, we extend those studies by examining the stability of that relationship within a beach, as affected by time of day and seasonal variations in source. Enterococcus spp. were quantified at three southern California beaches in the morning and afternoon using two qPCR assays, membrane filtration, and defined-substrate testing. While qPCR and culture-based measurements were consistently and significantly correlated, strength of the correlation varied both among and within beaches. Correlations were higher in the morning (0.45 < _ < 0.74 [P < 0.002]) than in the afternoon (0.18 < _ < 0.45 [P < 0.021]) and higher when the fecal contamination was concentrated (0.38 < _ < 0.83 [P < 0.001]) than when it was diffuse (0.19 < _ < 0.34 [P < 0.003]). The ratios of culture-based and qPCR results (CFU or most probable number [MPN] per calibrator cell equivalents [CCE]) also varied spatially and temporally. Ratios ranged between 0.04 and 0.85 CFU or MPN per CCE and were lowest at the beach affected by diffuse pollution. Patterns in the ratios over the course of the day were dissimilar across beaches, increasing with time at one beach and decreasing at another. The spatial and temporal variability we observed indicate that the empirical relationship between culture-based and qPCR results is not universal, even within a beach.",,,1,,,
2408,"Estimating and explaining the effect of education and income on head and neck cancer risk: INHANCE consortium pooled analysis of 31 case-control studies from 27 countries Low socioeconomic status has been reported to be associated with head and neck cancer risk. However, previous studies have been too small to examine the associations by cancer subsite, age, sex, global region and calendar time and to explain the association in terms of behavioral risk factors. Individual participant data of 23,964 cases with head and neck cancer and 31,954 controls from 31 studies in 27 countries pooled with random effects models. Overall, low education was associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer (OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 2.02 - 3.09). Overall one-third of the increased risk was not explained by differences in the distribution of cigarette smoking and alcohol behaviors; and it remained elevated among never users of tobacco and nondrinkers (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.13 - 2.31). More of the estimated education effect was not explained by cigarette smoking and alcohol behaviors: in women than in men, in older than younger groups, in the oropharynx than in other sites, in South/Central America than in Europe/North America and was strongest in countries with greater income inequality. Similar findings were observed for the estimated effect of low versus high household income. The lowest levels of income and educational attainment were associated with more than 2-fold increased risk of head and neck cancer, which is not entirely explained by differences in the distributions of behavioral risk factors for these cancers and which varies across cancer sites, sexes, countries and country income inequality levels. _ 2014 UICC.",,,3,,,

2410,"DNA methylation profiling in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study defines cancer subclasses differing in clinicopathologic characteristics and survival INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with several intrinsic subtypes differing by hormone receptor (HR) status, molecular profiles, and prognosis. However, the role of DNA methylation in breast cancer development and progression and its relationship with the intrinsic tumor subtypes are not fully understood. METHODS: A microarray targeting promoters of cancer-related genes was used to evaluate DNA methylation at 935 CpG sites in 517 breast tumors from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a population-based study of invasive breast cancer. RESULTS: Consensus clustering using methylation (_) values for the 167 most variant CpG loci defined four clusters differing most distinctly in HR status, intrinsic subtype (luminal versus basal-like), and p53 mutation status. Supervised analyses for HR status, subtype, and p53 status identified 266 differentially methylated CpG loci with considerable overlap. Genes relatively hypermethylated in HR+, luminal A, or p53 wild-type breast cancers included FABP3, FGF2, FZD9, GAS7, HDAC9, HOXA11, MME, PAX6, POMC, PTGS2, RASSF1, RBP1, and SCGB3A1, whereas those more highly methylated in HR-, basal-like, or p53 mutant tumors included BCR, C4B, DAB2IP, MEST, RARA, SEPT5, TFF1, THY1, and SERPINA5. Clustering also defined a hypermethylated luminal-enriched tumor cluster 3 that gene ontology analysis revealed to be enriched for homeobox and other developmental genes (ASCL2, DLK1, EYA4, GAS7, HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXB13, IHH, IPF1, ISL1, PAX6, TBX1, SOX1, and SOX17). Although basal-enriched cluster 2 showed worse short-term survival, the luminal-enriched cluster 3 showed worse long-term survival but was not independently prognostic in multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, likely due to the mostly early stage cases in this dataset. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that epigenetic patterns are strongly associated with HR status, subtype, and p53 mutation status and may show heterogeneity within tumor subclass. Among HR+ breast tumors, a subset exhibiting a gene signature characterized by hypermethylation of developmental genes and poorer clinicopathologic features may have prognostic value and requires further study. Genes differentially methylated between clinically important tumor subsets have roles in differentiation, development, and tumor growth and may be critical to establishing and maintaining tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes.",,,3,,,
2411,"Identification of a robust methylation classifier for cutaneous melanoma diagnosis Early diagnosis improves melanoma survival, yet the histopathological diagnosis of cutaneous primary melanoma can be challenging, even for expert dermatopathologists. Analysis of epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, that occur in melanoma can aid in its early diagnosis. Using a genome-wide methylation screening, we assessed CpG methylation in a diverse set of 89 primary invasive melanomas, 73 nevi, and 41 melanocytic proliferations of uncertain malignant potential, classified based on interobserver review by dermatopathologists. Melanomas and nevi were split into training and validation sets. Predictive modeling in the training set using ElasticNet identified a 40-CpG classifier distinguishing 60 melanomas from 48 nevi. High diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve_= 0.996, sensitivity_= 96.6%, and specificity_= 100.0%) was independently confirmed in the validation set (29 melanomas, 25 nevi) and other published sample sets. The 40-CpG melanoma classifier included homeobox transcription factors and genes with roles in stem cell pluripotency or the nervous system. Application of the 40-CpG melanoma classifier to the diagnostically uncertain samples assigned melanoma or nevus status, potentially offering a diagnostic tool to assist dermatopathologists. In summary, the robust, accurate 40-CpG melanoma classifier offers a promising assay for improving primary melanoma diagnosis. Copyright _ 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism that can regulate gene expression, could help to explain racial differences in breast tumor clinical biology and outcomes. METHODS: DNA methylation was evaluated at 1,287 CpGs in the promoters of cancer-related genes in 517 breast tumors of AA (n = 216) or non-AA (n = 301) cases in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS). RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression analysis of all tumors, controlling for age, menopausal status, stage, intrinsic subtype, and multiple comparisons [false discovery rate (FDR)], identified seven CpG probes that showed significant (adjusted P < 0.05) differential methylation between AAs and non-AAs. Stratified analyses detected an additional four CpG probes differing by race within hormone receptor-negative (HR(-)) tumors. Genes differentially methylated by race included DSC2, KCNK4, GSTM1, AXL, DNAJC15, HBII-52, TUSC3, and TES; the methylation state of several of these genes may be associated with worse survival in AAs. TCGA breast tumor data confirmed the differential methylation by race and negative correlations with expression for most of these genes. Several loci also showed racial differences in methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from CBCS cases, indicating that these variations were not necessarily tumor-specific. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in the methylation of cancer-related genes are detectable in both tumors and PBLs from breast cancer cases. IMPACT: Epigenetic variation could contribute to differences in breast tumor development and outcomes between AAs and non-AAs. _2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",,,3,,,

2414,"Choosing Among Pro-Poor Policy Options in the Delivery of Municipal Water Services The poor are most likely to suffer from a service provider that cannot reliably supply high-quality water through the piped network. Effectively assisting the poor is a key component of a successful tariff reform process. This paper provides practical, up-to-date advice that water utilities, municipalities, central governments, and donors can use to design and implement pro-poor policies for municipal water supply in low- and middle-income countries. After mapping contextual factors for a given situation and outlining the set of pro-poor policy alternatives, we use a simplified typology to diagnose common types of situations a water provider might be facing, provide policy recommendations, highlight potential policy mistakes, and discuss the challenges that policymakers are likely to face.",,,2,,,

2416,"T Follicular Helper Cell-Dependent Clearance of a Persistent Virus Infection Requires T Cell Expression of the Histone Demethylase UTX Epigenetic changes, including histone methylation, control T cell differentiation and memory formation, though the enzymes that mediate these processes are not clear. We show that UTX, a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, supports T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses that are essential for B cell antibody generation and the resolution of chronic viral infections. Mice with a T cell-specific UTX deletion had fewer Tfh cells, reduced germinal center responses, lacked virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), and were unable to resolve chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections. UTX-deficient T cells showed decreased expression of interleukin-6 receptor-_ and other Tfh cell-related genes that were associated with increased H3K27 methylation. Additionally, Turner Syndrome subjects, who are predisposed to chronic ear infections, had reduced UTX expression in immune cells and decreased circulating CD4(+) CXCR5(+) T cell frequency. Thus, we identify a critical link between UTX in T cells and immunity to infection. Copyright _ 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,5,,,
2417,"Cigarette smoking and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction: a pooled analysis from the international BEACON consortium BACKGROUND: Previous studies that showed an association between smoking and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction were limited in their ability to assess differences by tumor site, sex, dose-response, and duration of cigarette smoking cessation. METHODS: We used primary data from 10 population-based case-control studies and two cohort studies from the Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium. Analyses were restricted to white non-Hispanic men and women. Patients were classified as having esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 1540), esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (n = 1450), or a combination of both (all adenocarcinoma; n = 2990). Control subjects (n = 9453) were population based. Associations between pack-years of cigarette smoking and risks of adenocarcinomas were assessed, as well as their potential modification by sex and duration of smoking cessation. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) estimated using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, education, and gastroesophageal reflux, were pooled using a meta-analytic methodology to generate summary odds ratios. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The summary odds ratios demonstrated strong associations between cigarette smoking and esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.64 to 2.34), esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.84 to 2.58), and all adenocarcinoma (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.83 to 2.37). In addition, there was a strong dose-response association between pack-years of cigarette smoking and each outcome (P < .001). Compared with current smokers, longer smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of all adenocarcinoma after adjusting for pack-years (< 10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.13; and > or =10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.89). Sex-specific summary odds ratios were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction in white men and women; compared with current smoking, smoking cessation was associated with reduced risks.",,,3,,,
2418,"Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the Women's Health Study: effect of noncompliance Randomized evidence for aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among women is limited and suggests at most a modest effect for total CVD. Lack of compliance, however, can null-bias estimated effects. We used marginal structural models (MSMs) to estimate the etiologic effect of continuous aspirin use on CVD events among 39,876 apparently healthy female health professionals aged 45 years and older in the Women's Health Study, a randomized trial of 100 mg aspirin every other day versus placebo. As-treated analyses and MSMs controlled for time-varying determinants of aspirin use and CVD. Predictors of aspirin use differed by randomized group and prior use and included medical history, CVD risk factors, and intermediate CVD events. Previously reported intent-to-treat analyses found small non-significant effects of aspirin on total CVD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.91, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.81-1.03) and CVD mortality (HR = 0.95, 95 % CI = 0.74-1.22). As-treated analyses were similar for total CVD with a slight reduction in CVD mortality (HR = 0.88, 95 % CI = 0.67-1.16). MSMs, which adjusted for non-compliance, were similar for total CVD (HR = 0.93; 95 % CI: 0.81, 1.07) but suggested lower CVD mortality with aspirin use (HR = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.54, 1.08). Adjusting for non-compliance had little impact on the estimated effect of aspirin on total CVD, but strengthened the effect on CVD mortality. These results support a limited effect of low-dose aspirin on total CVD in women, but potential benefit for CVD mortality.",,,5,,,
2419,"Dysfunctional endogenous FIX impairs prophylaxis in a mouse hemophilia B model Factor IX (FIX) binds to collagen IV (Col4) in the subendothelial basement membrane. In hemophilia B, this FIX-Col4 interaction reduces the plasma recovery of infused FIX and plays a role in hemostasis. Studies examining the recovery of infused BeneFix (FIXWT) in null (cross-reactive material negative, CRM-) hemophilia B mice suggest the concentration of Col4 readily available for binding FIX is _405 nM with a 95% confidence interval of 374 to 436 nM. Thus, the vascular cache of FIX bound to Col4 is several-fold the FIX level measured in plasma. In a mouse model of prophylactic therapy (testing hemostasis by saphenous vein bleeding 7 days after infusion of 150 IU/kg FIX), FIXWT and the increased half-life FIXs Alprolix (FIXFC) and Idelvion (FIXAlb) produce comparable hemostatic results in CRM- mice. In bleeding CRM- hemophilia B mice, the times to first clot at a saphenous vein injury site after the infusions of the FIX agents are significantly different, at FIXWT < FIXFC < FIXAlb Dysfunctional forms of FIX, however, circulate in the majority of patients with hemophilia B (CRM+). In the mouse prophylactic therapy model, none of the FIX products improves hemostasis in CRM+ mice expressing a dysfunctional FIX, FIXR333Q, that nevertheless competes with infused FIX for Col4 binding and potentially other processes involving FIX. The results in this mouse model of CRM+ hemophilia B demonstrate that the endogenous expression of a dysfunctional FIX can deleteriously affect the hemostatic response to prophylactic therapy. _ 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.",,,1,,,
2420,"Glycerol-3-phosphate Acyltransferase Isoform-4 (GPAT4) Limits Oxidation of Exogenous Fatty Acids in Brown Adipocytes Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-4 (GPAT4) null pups grew poorly during the suckling period and, as adults, were protected from high fat diet-induced obesity. To determine why Gpat4(-/-) mice failed to gain weight during these two periods of high fat feeding, we examined energy metabolism. Compared with controls, the metabolic rate of Gpat4(-/-) mice fed a 45% fat diet was 12% higher. Core body temperature was 1 _C higher after high fat feeding. Food intake, fat absorption, and activity were similar in both genotypes. Impaired weight gain in Gpat4(-/-) mice did not result from increased heat loss, because both cold tolerance and response to a _3-adrenergic agonist were similar in both genotypes. Because GPAT4 comprises 65% of the total GPAT activity in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we characterized BAT function. A 45% fat diet increased the Gpat4(-/-) BAT expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor _ (PPAR) target genes, Cpt1_, Pgc1_, and Ucp1, and BAT mitochondria oxidized oleate and pyruvate at higher rates than controls, suggesting that fatty acid signaling and flux through the TCA cycle were enhanced. To assess the role of GPAT4 directly, neonatal BAT preadipocytes were differentiated to adipocytes. Compared with controls, Gpat4(-/-) brown adipocytes incorporated 33% less fatty acid into triacylglycerol and 46% more into the pathway of _-oxidation. The increased oxidation rate was due solely to an increase in the oxidation of exogenous fatty acids. These data suggest that in the absence of cold exposure, GPAT4 limits excessive fatty acid oxidation and the detrimental induction of a hypermetabolic state. _ 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,,4,,,
2421,"Public housing relocations and partnership dynamics in areas with high prevalences of sexually transmitted infections BACKGROUND: We investigated the implications of one structural intervention--public housing relocations--for partnership dynamics among individuals living areas with high sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence. High-prevalence areas fuel STI endemicity and are perpetuated by spatially assortative partnerships. METHODS: We analyzed 7 waves of data from a cohort of black adults (n = 172) relocating from 7 public housing complexes in Atlanta, Georgia. At each wave, data on whether participants' sexual partners lived in the neighborhood were gathered via survey. Participant addresses were geocoded to census tracts, and measures of tract-level STI prevalence, socioeconomic conditions, and other attributes were created for each wave. ""High-prevalence tracts"" were tracts in the highest quartile of STI prevalence in Georgia. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical generalized linear models examined trajectories of spatially assortative partnerships and identified predictors of assortativity among participants in high-prevalence tracts. RESULTS: All 7 tracts containing public housing complexes at baseline were high-prevalence tracts; most participants relocated to high-prevalence tracts. Spatially assortative partnerships had a U-shaped distribution: the mean percent of partners living in participants' neighborhoods at baseline was 54%; this mean declined to 28% at wave 2 and was 45% at wave 7. Participants who experienced greater postrelocation improvements in tract-level socioeconomic conditions had a lower odds of having spatially assortative partnerships (adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06-2.26). CONCLUSIONS: Public housing relocation initiatives may disrupt high-prevalence areas if residents experience significant postrelocation gains in tract-level socioeconomic conditions.",,,6,,,
2422,"Impact of public housing relocations: are changes in neighborhood conditions related to STIs among relocaters? BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional and ecologic studies suggest that place characteristics influence sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Using data from a predominately substance-misusing cohort of African American adults relocating from US public housing complexes, this multilevel longitudinal study tested the hypothesis that participants who experienced greater postrelocation improvements in neighborhood conditions (i.e., socioeconomic disadvantage, social disorder, STI prevalence, and male/female sex ratios) would have reduced the odds of testing positive for an STI over time. METHODS: Baseline data were collected in 2009 from 172 public housing residents before relocations occurred; 3 waves of postrelocation data were collected every 9 months thereafter. Polymerase chain reaction methods were used to test participants' urine for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Individual-level characteristics were assessed via survey. Administrative data described the census tracts where participants lived at each wave (e.g., sex ratios, violent crime rates, and poverty rates). Hypotheses were tested using multilevel models. RESULTS: Participants experienced improvements in all tract-level conditions studied and reductions in STIs over time (baseline: 29% tested STI positive; wave 4: 16% tested positive). Analyses identified a borderline statistically significant relationship between moving to tracts with more equitable sex ratios and reduced odds of testing positive for an STI (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-1.01). Changes in other neighborhood conditions were not associated with this outcome. DISCUSSION: Consonant with past research, our findings suggest that moving to areas with more equitable sex ratios reduces the risk of STI infection. Future research should study the extent to which this relationship is mediated by changes in sexual network dynamics.",,,2,,,
2423,"Changes in Exposure to Neighborhood Characteristics are Associated with Sexual Network Characteristics in a Cohort of Adults Relocating from Public Housing Ecologic and cross-sectional multilevel analyses suggest that characteristics of the places where people live influence their vulnerability to HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Using data from a predominately substance-misusing cohort of African-American adults relocating from US public housing complexes, this multilevel longitudinal study tested the hypothesis that participants who experienced greater post-relocation improvements in economic disadvantage, violent crime, and male:female sex ratios would experience greater reductions in perceived partner risk and in the odds of having a partner who had another partner (i.e., indirect concurrency). Baseline data were collected from 172 public housing residents before relocations occurred; three waves of post-relocation data were collected every 9 months. Participants who experienced greater improvements in community violence and in economic conditions experienced greater reductions in partner risk. Reduced community violence was associated with reduced indirect concurrency. Structural interventions that decrease exposure to violence and economic disadvantage may reduce vulnerability to HIV/STIs.",,,2,,,

2427,"Ongoing HIV transmission and the HIV care continuum in north carolina OBJECTIVE: HIV transmission is influenced by status awareness and receipt of care and treatment. We analyzed these attributes of named partners of persons with acute HIV infection (index AHI cases) to characterize the transmission landscape in North Carolina (NC). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of programmatic data. METHODS: We used data from the NC Screening and Tracing of Active Transmission Program (2002-2013) to determine HIV status (uninfected, AHI, or chronic HIV infection [CHI]), diagnosis status (new or previously-diagnosed), and care and treatment status (not in care, in care and not on treatment, in care and on treatment) of index AHI cases' named partners. We developed an algorithm identifying the most likely transmission source among known HIV-infected partners to estimate the proportion of transmissions arising from contact with persons at different HIV continuum stages. We conducted a complementary analysis among a subset of index AHI cases and partners with phylogenetically-linked viruses. RESULTS: Overall, 358 index AHI cases named 932 partners, of which 218 were found to be HIV-infected (162 (74.3%) previously-diagnosed, 11 (5.0%) new AHI, 45 (20.6%) new CHI). Most transmission events appeared attributable to previously-diagnosed partners (77.4%, 95% confidence interval 69.4-85.3%). Among these previously-diagnosed partners, 23.2% (14.0-32.3%) were reported as in care and on treatment near the index AHI case diagnosis date. In the subset study of 33 phylogenetically-linked cases and partners, 60.6% of partners were previously diagnosed (43.9-77.3%). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of HIV transmission in this setting appears attributable to contact with previously-diagnosed partners, reinforcing the need for improved engagement in care after diagnosis.",,,6,,,
2428,"Distance to testing sites and its association with timing of HIV diagnosis Early HIV diagnosis enables prompt treatment initiation, thereby contributing to decreased morbidity, mortality, and transmission. We aimed to describe the association between distance from residence to testing sites and HIV disease stage at diagnosis. Using HIV surveillance data, we identified all new HIV diagnoses made at publicly funded testing sites in central North Carolina during 2005-2013. Early-stage HIV was defined as acute HIV (antibody-negative test with a positive HIV RNA) or recent HIV (normalized optical density < 0.8 on the BED assay for non-AIDS cases); remaining diagnoses were considered post-early-stage HIV. Street distance between residence at diagnosis and (1) the closest testing site and (2) the diagnosis site was dichotomized at 5 miles. We fit log-binomial models using generalized estimating equations to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and robust 95% confidence intervals (CI) for post-early-stage diagnoses by distance. Models were adjusted for race/ethnicity and testing period. Most of the 3028 new diagnoses were black (N_=_2144; 70.8%), men who have sex with men (N_=_1685; 55.7%), and post-early-stage HIV diagnoses (N_=_2010; 66.4%). Overall, 1145 (37.8%) cases traveled < 5 miles for a diagnosis. Among cases traveling _5 miles for a diagnosis, 1273 (67.6%) lived < 5 miles from a different site. Residing _5 miles from a testing site was not associated with post-early-stage HIV (adjusted PR, 95% CI: 0.98, 0.92-1.04), but traveling _5 miles for a diagnosis was associated with higher post-early HIV prevalence (1.07, 1.02-1.13). Most of the elevated prevalence observed in cases traveling _5 miles for a diagnosis occurred among those living < 5 miles from a different site (1.09, 1.03-1.16). Modest increases in post-early-stage HIV diagnosis were apparent among persons living near a site, but choosing to travel longer distances to test. Understanding reasons for increased travel distances could improve accessibility and acceptability of HIV services and increase early diagnosis rates.",,,6,,,
2429,"Measuring Concurrency Attitudes: Development and Validation of a Vignette-Based Scale BACKGROUND: Concurrent sexual partnerships (partnerships that overlap in time) may contribute to higher rates of HIV transmission in African Americans. Attitudes toward a behavior constitute an important component of most models of health-related behavior and behavioral change. We have developed a scale, employing realistic vignettes that appear to reliably measure attitudes about concurrency in young African American adults. METHODS: Vignette-based items to assess attitudes about concurrency were developed following focus groups and cognitive testing of items adapted from existing scales assessing psychosocial constructs surrounding related sexual behaviors. The new items were included in a telephone survey of African American adults (18-34 years old) in Eastern North Carolina immediately before and after a radio campaign designed to discourage concurrency. We performed an exploratory factor analysis on each sample (pre- and post-campaign) to cross-validate results. We retained factors with a primary loading of _0.50 and no secondary loading >0.30. Cronbach's coefficient alpha was used to evaluate internal reliability. Associations in the predicted direction between the mean responses to items on the final factor and known correlates of concurrency validated the scale. RESULTS: Factor analysis in a random pre-campaign subsample yielded a one-factor 6-item scale with acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's _ = 0.79). As expected, the attitude factor was positively associated with participation in concurrent partnerships, whether assessed by self-report (r = 0.298, p< 0.0001) or deduced from dates of recent sexual partnerships (r = 0.298, p< 0.0001). The factor was also positively associated with alcohol (r = 0.216, p< 0.0001) and drug use (r = 0.225, p< 0.0001) and negatively associated with increasing age (r = -0.088, p- = 0.02) and female gender (r = -0.232, p< 0.0001). Factor analyses repeated in the second random pre-campaign subsample and post-campaign sample confirmed these results. CONCLUSION: A vignette-based scale may be an effective measure of key attitudes related to concurrency and potentially a useful tool to evaluate interventions addressing this network pattern.",,,3,,,
2430,"Project GRACE: a staged approach to development of a community-academic partnership to address HIV in rural African American communities The HIV epidemic is a health crisis in rural African American communities in the Southeast United States; however, to date little attention has been paid to community-academic collaborations to address HIV in these communities.

We used role theory to explore their expectations, potential conflicts, and synergy with research. METHODS: Four focus groups (n = 30) were conducted with pastors and analyzed using principles of grounded theory and content analysis. RESULTS: Pastors identified a variety of potential roles in research. They noted potential conflicts due to perceptions of research, the process, and pace of research. Areas of synergy included perceptions of health disparities research as consistent with the healthy mind, body, and spirit ideology, and clear benefits to congregations and communities. Pastors' research expectations included long-term commitments, honest and clear communication, investigator visibility, respect for church traditions/practices, and support in forming collaborations.

2433,"Heart Matters: a study protocol for a community based randomized trial aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk in a rural, African American community BACKGROUND: African Americans living in the rural south have the highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the United States. Given this geographic and racial disparity, intervention implementation needs to be evaluated for effectiveness and feasibility with African Americans in the rural south. METHODS: The trial developed out of a community-based participatory research partnership, Project GRACE, and community partners who are collaborators throughout the study. Heart Matters is a randomized stepped wedge trial that will assess the effectiveness of a 12-month behavioral change intervention adapted from PREMIER, an evidence-based treatment targeting multiple CVD risk factors. 140 participants will be recruited through 8 community- or faith-based organizations to participate in the intervention. Through matched pair randomization, organizations will be randomized to begin immediately after baseline data collection (Arm 1) or delayed 6_months (Arm 2). Data collection will occur at baseline, 6, 12, and 18_months. The primary outcome is change in body weight. In addition to assessing effectiveness, the study will also evaluate process and feasibility outcomes through quantitative and qualitative data collection. DISCUSSION: This study will contribute to CVD prevention research and likely have a positive impact on the rural, African American community where the trial occurs. Our study is unique in its use of community partnerships to develop, implement, and evaluate the intervention. We expect that this approach will enhance the feasibility of the trial, as well as future dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials, NCT02707432 .

2434,"Genetic signatures in choline and 1-carbon metabolism are associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis Choline metabolism is important for very low-density lipoprotein secretion, making this nutritional pathway an important contributor to hepatic lipid balance. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the cumulative effects of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across genes of choline/1-carbon metabolism and functionally related pathways increase susceptibility to developing hepatic steatosis. In biopsy-characterized cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and controls, we assessed 260 SNPs across 21 genes in choline/1-carbon metabolism. When SNPs were examined individually, using logistic regression, we only identified a single SNP (PNPLA3 rs738409) that was significantly associated with severity of hepatic steatosis after adjusting for confounders and multiple comparisons (P=0.02). However, when groupings of SNPs in similar metabolic pathways were defined using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified groups of subjects with shared SNP signatures that were significantly correlated with steatosis burden (P=0.0002). The lowest and highest steatosis clusters could also be differentiated by ethnicity. However, unique SNP patterns defined steatosis burden irrespective of ethnicity. Our results suggest that analysis of SNP patterns in genes of choline/1-carbon metabolism may be useful for prediction of severity of steatosis in specific subsets of people, and the metabolic inefficiencies caused by these SNPs should be examined further.",,,8,,,
2435,"Choline metabolism provides novel insights into nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its progression PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Choline is an essential nutrient and the liver is a central organ responsible for choline metabolism. Hepatosteatosis and liver cell death occur when humans are deprived of choline. In the last few years, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that influence choline requirements in humans and in our understanding of choline's effects on liver function. These advances are useful in elucidating why nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs and progresses sometimes to hepatocarcinogenesis.RECENT FINDINGS: Humans eating low-choline diets develop fatty liver and liver damage. This dietary requirement for choline is modulated by estrogen and by single-nucleotide polymorphisms in specific genes of choline and folate metabolism. The spectrum of choline's effects on liver range from steatosis to development of hepatocarcinomas, and several mechanisms for these effects have been identified. They include abnormal phospholipid synthesis, defects in lipoprotein secretion, oxidative damage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the hepatic steatosis phenotype can be characterized more fully via metabolomic signatures and is influenced by the gut microbiome. Importantly, the intricate connection between liver function, one-carbon metabolism, and energy metabolism is just beginning to be elucidated.SUMMARY: Choline influences liver function, and the dietary requirement for this nutrient varies depending on an individual's genotype and estrogen status. Understanding these individual differences is important for gastroenterologists seeking to understand why some individuals develop NAFLD and others do not, and why some patients tolerate total parenteral nutrition and others develop liver dysfunction.",,,1,,,
2436,"The nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics of the dietary requirement for choline Advances in nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics have been instrumental in demonstrating that nutrient requirements vary among individuals. This is exemplified by studies of the nutrient choline, in which gender, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, estrogen status, and gut microbiome composition have been shown to influence its optimal intake level. Choline is an essential nutrient with a wide range of biological functions, and current studies are aimed at refining our understanding of its requirements and, importantly, on defining the molecular mechanisms that mediate its effects in instances of suboptimal dietary intake. This chapter introduces the reader to challenges in developing individual nutrition recommendations, the biological function of choline, current and future research paradigms to fully understand the consequences of inadequate choline nutrition, and some forward thinking about the potential for individualized nutrition recommendations to become a tangible application for improved health.

Children were classified into three groups based on confirmation of ASD (n_=_698), non-ASD developmental delay (DD; n_=_887), or controls drawn from the general population (POP; n_=_979). Diagnoses of any diabetes or hypertensive disorder during pregnancy were identified from prenatal medical records and maternal self-report. Logistic regression models estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI) adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking during pregnancy, and study site. Models for hypertension were additionally adjusted for parity and plurality. Among 2,564 mothers, we identified 246 (9.6%) with any diabetes and 386 (15.1%) with any hypertension in pregnancy. After adjustment for covariates, any diabetes during pregnancy was not associated with ASD (aOR_=_1.10 [95% CI 0.77, 1.56]), but any hypertension was associated with ASD (aOR_=_1.69 [95% CI 1.26, 2.26]). Results were similar for DD, and any diabetes (aOR_=_1.29 [95% CI 0.94, 1.78]) or any hypertension (aOR_=_1.71 [95% CI 1.30, 2.25]). Some pregnancy complications, such as hypertension, may play a role in autism etiology and can possibly serve as a prompt for more vigilant ASD screening efforts.

LAY SUMMARY: We studied if common complications in pregnancy are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a large sample of mothers and children. Our results show an association between conditions marked by high blood pressure and ASD, but no association with conditions marked by high blood sugar and ASD. Associations were similar for children who had a developmental disorder that was not ASD, suggesting that this relationship may not be specific to ASD. _ 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,3,,,

2440,"Regression models on riemannian symmetric spaces The aim of this paper is to develop a general regression framework for the analysis of manifold-valued response in a Riemannian symmetric space (RSS) and its association with multiple covariates of interest, such as age or gender, in Euclidean space. Such RSS-valued data arises frequently in medical imaging, surface modeling, and computer vision, among many others. We develop an intrinsic regression model solely based on an intrinsic conditional moment assumption, avoiding specifying any parametric distribution in RSS. We propose various link functions to map from the Euclidean space of multiple covariates to the RSS of responses. We develop a two-stage procedure to calculate the parameter estimates and determine their asymptotic distributions. We construct the Wald and geodesic test statistics to test hypotheses of unknown parameters. We systematically investigate the geometric invariant property of these estimates and test statistics. Simulation studies and a real data analysis are used to evaluate the finite sample properties of our methods.",,,1,,,
2441,"Relationship between human leukocyte antigen alleles and risk of Kaposi's sarcoma in Cameroon Several studies published to date report associations between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and different types of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS). However, there is little concordance between the HLA alleles identified and the populations studied. To test whether HLA alleles associate with KS in a Cameroonian case-control study, we performed high-resolution HLA typing in KSHV seropositive individuals. Among HIV-positive individuals, carriers of HLA-B*14:01 were at a significantly higher risk of AIDS-KS (p_=_0.033). For HIV-negative patients, a gene-wise comparison of allele frequencies identified the HLA-B (p_=_0.008) and -DQA1 (p_=_0.002) loci as possible risk factors for endemic KS. Our study provides additional understanding of genetic determinants of KS and their implications in disease pathogenesis. Further validation of these findings is needed to define the functional relevance of these associations.",,,8,,,

2443,"HPTN 062: a feasibility and acceptability pilot intervention to reduce HIV transmission risk behaviors among individuals with acute and early HIV infection in Lilongwe, Malawi Acute HIV infection (AHI) is a relatively brief period of time when individuals are highly infectious and the opportunity to intervene to prevent forward transmission is extremely limited. HPTN 062 partnered with CHAVI 001 to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a motivational interviewing (MI)-based counseling intervention to reduce HIV-transmission risk behaviors among individuals with acute and early HIV infection in Lilongwe, Malawi. Participants were randomized to receive either (1) brief education sessions about HIV and AHI; or (2) the same brief education sessions plus an MI-based counseling intervention called Uphungu Wanga. Although Uphungu Wanga was determined to be feasible and acceptable, few major differences existed between the two arms with regard to acceptability, feasibility, and self-reported sexual behaviors. We therefore conclude that an additional MI-based counseling intervention may not be needed during the short period of AHI. Instead, we recommend that individuals with AHI receive frequent, but brief, counseling immediately after diagnosis and then transition to receiving counseling at less frequent intervals until they can initiate antiretroviral therapy. Other recommendations are provided.",,,6,,,
2444,"Genome-wide association study of selenium concentrations Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in human nutrition, but its role in certain health conditions, particularly among Se sufficient populations, is controversial. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of blood Se concentrations previously identified a locus at 5q14 near BHMT. We performed a GW meta-analysis of toenail Se concentrations, which reflect a longer duration of exposure than blood Se concentrations, including 4162 European descendants from four US cohorts. Toenail Se was measured using neutron activation analysis. We identified a GW-significant locus at 5q14 (P < 1 _ 10(-16)), the same locus identified in the published GWAS of blood Se based on independent cohorts. The lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) explained _1% of the variance in toenail Se concentrations. Using GW-summary statistics from both toenail and blood Se, we observed statistical evidence of polygenic overlap (P < 0.001) and meta-analysis of results from studies of either trait (n = 9639) yielded a second GW-significant locus at 21q22.3, harboring CBS (P < 4 _ 10(-8)). Proteins encoded by genes at 5q14 and 21q22.3 function in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism, and index SNPs for each have previously been associated with betaine and Hcy levels in GWAS. Our findings show evidence of a genetic link between Se and Hcy pathways, both involved in cardiometabolic disease. _ The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

2447,"Key role of drug shops and pharmacies for family planning in urban nigeria and kenya BACKGROUND: The Family Planning 2020 initiative aims to reach 120 million new family planning users by 2020. Drug shops and pharmacies are important private-sector sources of contraception in many contexts but are less well understood than public-sector sources, especially in urban environments. This article explores the role that drug shops and pharmacies play in the provision of contraceptive methods in selected urban areas of Nigeria and Kenya as well as factors associated with women's choice of where to obtain these methods. METHODS: Using data collected in 2010/2011 from representative samples of women in selected urban areas of Nigeria and Kenya as well as a census of pharmacies and drug shops audited in 2011, we examine the role of drug shops and pharmacies in the provision of short-acting contraceptive methods and factors associated with a women's choice of family planning source. RESULTS: In urban Nigeria and Kenya, drug shops and pharmacies were the major source for the family planning methods of oral contraceptive pills, emergency contraceptives, and condoms. The majority of injectable users obtained their method from public facilities in both countries, but 14% of women in Nigeria and 6% in Kenya obtained injectables from drug shops or pharmacies. Harder-to-reach populations were the most likely to choose these outlets to obtain their short-acting methods. For example, among users of these methods in Nigeria, younger women (< 25 years old) were significantly more likely to obtain their method from a drug shop or pharmacy than another type of facility. In both countries, family planning users who had never been married were significantly more likely than married users to obtain these methods from a drug shop or a pharmacy than from a public-sector health facility. Low levels of family planning-related training (57% of providers in Kenya and 41% in Nigeria had received training) and lack of family planning promotional activities in pharmacies and drug shops in both countries indicate the need for additional support from family planning programs to leverage this important access point. CONCLUSIONS: Drug shops and pharmacies offer an important and under-leveraged mechanism for expanding family planning access to women in urban Nigeria and Kenya, and potentially elsewhere. Vulnerable and harder-to-reach groups such as younger, unmarried women and women who do not yet have children are the most likely to benefit from increased access to family planning at drug shops and pharmacies. _ Corroon et al.",,,2,,,
2448,"The role of gender empowerment on reproductive health outcomes in urban Nigeria To date, limited evidence is available for urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically research into the association between urban women's empowerment and reproductive health outcomes. The objective of this study is to investigate whether women's empowerment in urban Nigerian settings is associated with family planning use and maternal health behaviors. Moreover, we examine whether different effects of empowerment exist by region of residence. This study uses baseline household survey data from the Measurement, Learning and Evaluation Project for the Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative being implemented in six major cities. We examine four dimensions of empowerment: economic freedom, attitudes towards domestic violence, partner prohibitions and decision-making. We determine if the empowerment dimensions have different effects on reproductive health outcomes by region of residence using multivariate analyses. Results indicate that more empowered women are more likely to use modern contraception, deliver in a health facility and have a skilled attendant at birth. These trends vary by empowerment dimension and by city/region in Nigeria. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings on future programs seeking to improve reproductive health outcomes in urban Nigeria and beyond.",,,2,,,
2449,"Contributions of symptomatic osteoarthritis and physical function to incident cardiovascular disease BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with worsening physical function and a high prevalence of comorbid health conditions. In particular, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is higher in individuals with OA than the general population. Limitations in physical function may be one pathway to the development of CVD among individuals with OA. This study evaluated associations of symptomatic knee OA (sxKOA), baseline physical function and worsening of function over time with self-reported incident CVD in a community-based cohort. METHODS: Our sample consisted of individuals from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project who did not report having CVD at baseline. Variables used to evaluate physical function were the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), time to complete 5 chair stands, and the 8-ft walk. Worsening function for these variables was defined based on previous literature and cutoffs from our sample. Logistic regression analyses examined associations of sxKOA, baseline function and worsening of function over time with self-reported incident CVD, unadjusted and adjusted for relevant demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 1709 participants included in these analyses, the mean age was 59.5___9.5_years, 63.6% were women, 15% had sxKOA, and the follow up time was 5.9___1.2_years. About a third of participants reported worsening HAQ score, about two-fifths had worsened chair stand time, half had worsened walking speed during the 8-ft walk, and 16% self-reported incident CVD. In unadjusted analyses, sxKOA, baseline function, and worsening function were all associated with self-reported incident CVD. In multivariable models including all of these variables, sxKOA was not associated with incident CVD, but worsening function was significantly associated with increased CVD risk, for all three functional measures: HAQ odds ratio (OR)_=_2.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90-3.25), chair stands OR_=_1.58 (95% CI 1.20-2.08), 8-ft walk OR_=_1.53 (95%CI 1.15-2.04). These associations for worsening function remained in models additionally adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics related to CVD risk. CONCLUSIONS: The association between symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease risk was explained by measures of physical function. This highlights the importance of physical activity and other strategies to prevent functional loss among individuals with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.",,,9,,,
2450,"Association of the DASH dietary pattern with insulin resistance and diabetes in US Hispanic/Latino adults: results from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between diet quality and both diabetes status and insulin resistance in Hispanic/Latino adults, and the extent to which differences in diet quality contribute to differences in outcomes across Hispanic/Latino heritage. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Data are from 15_942 individuals enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Diet was ascertained using two 24-hour dietary recalls, and diet quality was measured using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (range: 0-80, lowest to highest). Diabetes status was defined based on self-reported diagnosis, use of antihyperglycemic medications, or unrecognized diabetes (determined by baseline laboratory measures). Insulin resistance was determined using homeostatic model assessment of _-cell function and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The association between DASH and diabetes status was examined using multinomial logistic regression. The association between DASH and HOMA-IR was assessed using linear regression, and we tested whether the association was modified by Hispanic/Latino heritage or diabetes status. RESULTS: DASH score was highest in those with self-reported diabetes (controlled) and no medications (44.8%). A higher DASH score was associated with a lower HOMA-IR, and the association was the same regardless of diabetes status (p>0.8 for the interaction). CONCLUSIONS: The association between DASH and diabetes status was strongest for those with controlled self-reported diabetes and who were not taking antihyperglycemic medications. A higher DASH score was associated with less insulin resistance among Hispanics/Latinos. Differences in DASH scores by Hispanic/Latino heritage did not explain the differences in prevalence of diabetes and insulin resistance reported in the diverse Hispanic/Latino population.

2451,"Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids potentiates oxidative stress in human airway epithelial cells exposed to ozone BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of the omega-3 family of polyunsaturated fatty acids (_-3 FA) is associated with anti-inflammatory effects. However, unsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to oxidation, which produces pro-inflammatory mediators. Ozone (O3) is a tropospheric pollutant that reacts rapidly with unsaturated fatty acids to produce electrophilic and oxidative mediators of inflammation. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether supplementation with _-3 FA alters O3-induced oxidative stress in human airway epithelial cells (HAEC). METHODS: 16-HBE cells expressing a genetically encoded sensor of the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG, EGSH) were supplemented with saturated, monounsaturated, or _-3 FA prior to exposure to 0, 0.08, 0.1, or 0.3_ppm O3. Lipid peroxidation was measured in cellular lipid extracts and intact cells following O3 exposure. RESULTS: Relative to cells incubated with the saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids, cells supplemented with _-3 FA containing 5 or 6 double bonds showed a marked increase in EGSH during exposure to O3 concentrations as low as 0.08_ppm. Consistent with this finding, the concentration of lipid hydroperoxides produced following O3 exposure was significantly elevated in _-3 FA supplemented cells. DISCUSSION: Supplementation with polyunsaturated _-3 FA potentiates oxidative responses, as indicated by EGSH, in HAEC exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of O3. This effect is mediated by the increased formation of lipid hydroperoxides produced by the reaction of O3 with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Given the inflammatory activity of lipid hydroperoxides, these findings have implications for the potential role of _-3 FA in increasing human susceptibility to the adverse health effects of O3 exposure.

2452,"Prophylactic and postexposure efficacy of a potent human monoclonal antibody against MERS coronavirus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection caused by a previously unidentified coronavirus (CoV), likely transmitted to humans by infected camels. There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral for MERS, therefore new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections are needed. In this study, we describe, for the first time, to our knowledge, the isolation of a potent MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibody from memory B cells of an infected individual. The antibody, named LCA60, binds to a novel site on the spike protein and potently neutralizes infection of multiple MERS-CoV isolates by interfering with the binding to the cellular receptor CD26. Importantly, using mice transduced with adenovirus expressing human CD26 and infected with MERS-CoV, we show that LCA60 can effectively protect in both prophylactic and postexposure settings. This antibody can be used for prophylaxis, for postexposure prophylaxis of individuals at risk, or for the treatment of human cases of MERS-CoV infection. The fact that it took only 4 mo from the initial screening of B cells derived from a convalescent patient for the development of a stable chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing neutralizing antibodies at more than 5 g/L provides an example of a rapid pathway toward the generation of effective antiviral therapies against emerging viruses.",,,1,,,
2453,"Mean-Variance QTL Mapping Identifies Novel QTL for Circadian Activity and Exploratory Behavior in Mice We illustrate, through two case studies, that ""mean-variance QTL mapping""-QTL mapping that models effects on the mean and the variance simultaneously-can discover QTL that traditional interval mapping cannot. Mean-variance QTL mapping is based on the double generalized linear model, which extends the standard linear model used in interval mapping by incorporating not only a set of genetic and covariate effects for mean but also set of such effects for the residual variance. Its potential for use in QTL mapping has been described previously, but it remains underutilized, with certain key advantages undemonstrated until now. In the first case study, a reduced complexity intercross of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice examining circadian behavior, our reanalysis detected a mean-controlling QTL for circadian wheel running activity that interval mapping did not; mean-variance QTL mapping was more powerful than interval mapping at the QTL because it accounted for the fact that mice homozygous for the C57BL/6N allele had less residual variance than other mice. In the second case study, an intercross between C57BL/6J and C58/J mice examining anxiety-like behaviors, our reanalysis detected a variance-controlling QTL for rearing behavior; interval mapping did not identify this QTL because it does not target variance QTL. We believe that the results of these reanalyses, which in other respects largely replicated the original findings, support the use of mean-variance QTL mapping as standard practice.

2454,"vqtl: An R Package for Mean-Variance QTL Mapping We present vqtl, an R package for mean-variance QTL mapping. This QTL mapping approach tests for genetic loci that influence the mean of the phenotype, termed mean QTL, the variance of the phenotype, termed variance QTL, or some combination of the two, termed mean-variance QTL. It is unique in its ability to correct for variance heterogeneity arising not only from the QTL itself but also from nuisance factors, such as sex, batch, or housing. This package provides functions to conduct genome scans, run permutations to assess the statistical significance, and make informative plots to communicate results. Because it is inter-operable with the popular qtl package and uses many of the same data structures and input patterns, it will be straightforward for geneticists to analyze future experiments with vqtl as well as re-analyze past experiments, possibly discovering new QTL.

2455,"QTL mapping on a background of variance heterogeneity Standard QTL mapping procedures seek to identify genetic loci affecting the phenotypic mean while assuming that all individuals have the same residual variance. But when the residual variance differs systematically between groups, perhaps due to a genetic or environmental factor, such standard procedures can falter: in testing for QTL associations, they attribute too much weight to observations that are noisy and too little to those that are precise, resulting in reduced power and and increased susceptibility to false positives. The negative effects of such ""background variance heterogeneity"" (BVH) on standard QTL mapping have received little attention until now, although the subject is closely related to work on the detection of variance-controlling genes. Here we use simulation to examine how BVH affects power and false positive rate for detecting QTL affecting the mean (mQTL), the variance (vQTL), or both (mvQTL). We compare linear regression for mQTL and Levene's test for vQTL, with tests more recently developed, including tests based on the double generalized linear model (DGLM), which can model BVH explicitly. We show that, when used in conjunction with a suitable permutation procedure, the DGLM-based tests accurately control false positive rate and are more powerful than the other tests. We also find that some adverse effects of BVH can be mitigated by applying a rank inverse normal transform. We apply our novel approach, which we term ""mean-variance QTL mapping"", to publicly available data on a mouse backcross and, after accommodating BVH driven by sire, detect a new mQTL for bodyweight.

2456,"Nutrition status of children in Latin America The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rapidly increasing among Latin American children, posing challenges for current healthcare systems and increasing the risk for a wide range of diseases. To understand the factors contributing to childhood obesity in Latin America, this paper reviews the current nutrition status and physical activity situation, the disparities between and within countries and the potential challenges for ensuring adequate nutrition and physical activity. Across the region, children face a dual burden of undernutrition and excess weight. While efforts to address undernutrition have made marked improvements, childhood obesity is on the rise as a result of diets that favour energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle. Over the last decade, changes in socioeconomic conditions, urbanization, retail foods and public transportation have all contributed to childhood obesity in the region. Additional research and research capacity are needed to address this growing epidemic, particularly with respect to designing, implementing and evaluating the impact of evidence-based obesity prevention interventions. _ 2017 The Authors.

2457,"Hormonal Contraception Use is Common Among Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and an Elevated Risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis BACKGROUND: Persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We sought to examine whether the self-report of hormonal contraception (HC), as a proxy for exposure to estrogen-based contraception, was less common for women with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism. METHODS: We examined the prevalence of personal use of hormonal birth control in a large internet-based cohort of patients with IBD. To determine whether HC was less common among patients with IBD with increased risk of thrombosis, we estimated unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for the use of HC. RESULTS: Thousand four hundred ninety-nine female survey respondents answered optional fertility questions and were included in the analysis. The prevalence of HC was 33.7% (95% CI, 30.6%-36.9%) among women with Crohn's disease and was 32.6% (95% CI, 28.6%-36.8%) for women with ulcerative colitis. Women with one risk factor for thrombosis were not significantly less likely to receive HC (PR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.76-1.08; adjusted PR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.80-1.11) compared with women without risk factors nor were women with 2 or more risk factors (PR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.56-1.28; adjusted PR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.83-1.45). The use of an intrauterine device was also similar between women with and without risk factors for venous thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HC use in women with multiple risk factors was similar to that in women without risk factors, which represents an opportunity for prevention. Gastroenterologists should ask patients with IBD using HC about risk factors for thromboembolic disease to identify patients who may benefit from alternative contraception.",,,3,,,
2458,"Identification of four novel susceptibility loci for oestrogen receptor negative breast cancer Common variants in 94 loci have been associated with breast cancer including 15 loci with genome-wide significant associations (P< 5 _ 10(-8)) with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer and BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk. In this study, to identify new ER-negative susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisting of 4,939 ER-negative cases and 14,352 controls, combined with 7,333 ER-negative cases and 42,468 controls and 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers genotyped on the iCOGS array. We identify four previously unidentified loci including two loci at 13q22 near KLF5, a 2p23.2 locus near WDR43 and a 2q33 locus near PPIL3 that display genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer. In addition, 19 known breast cancer risk loci have genome-wide significant associations and 40 had moderate associations (P< 0.05) with ER-negative disease. Using functional and eQTL studies we implicate TRMT61B and WDR43 at 2p23.2 and PPIL3 at 2q33 in ER-negative breast cancer aetiology.

2459,"Fructose intake and cardiovascular risk factors in youth with type 1 diabetes: SEARCH for diabetes in youth study AIMS: High consumption of dietary fructose has been shown to contribute to dyslipidemia and elevated blood pressure in adults, but there are few data in youth, particularly those at greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to examine the association between fructose intake and CVD risk factors in a diverse population of youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, including 2085 youth ages 10-22 years with T1D, of which 22% were racial/ethnic minority and 50% were female. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess intake. RESULTS: Median daily fructose consumption was 7.9% of total calories. Fructose intake was positively associated with triglycerides (p< .01), but not with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, or blood pressure after adjustment for physical activity and socio-demographic, clinical, and dietary covariates. An increase in fructose intake of 22 g (equivalent to a 12 oz can of soda) was associated with 23% higher odds of borderline/high versus low triglycerides (p< .005). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that children with T1D should moderate their intake of fructose, particularly those with borderline or high triglycerides. Copyright _ 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2460,"Parasite clearance following treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment in Burkina-Faso and Mali: 42-day in vivo follow-up study BACKGROUND: Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is widely used for the control of malaria in pregnancy in Africa. The emergence of resistance to SP is a concern requiring monitoring the effectiveness of SP for IPTp. METHODS: This was an in-vivo efficacy study to determine the parasitological treatment response and the duration of post-treatment prophylaxis among asymptomatic pregnant women receiving SP as part of IPTp in Mali and Burkina-Faso. The primary outcome was the PCR-unadjusted % of patients with parasites recurrence by day 42 defined as a positive diagnostic test by malaria smear at any visit between days 4 and 42. Treatment failure was based on the standard World Health Organization criteria. The therapeutic response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier curve. RESULTS: A total of 580 women were enrolled in Mali (N=268) and Burkina-Faso (N=312) and followed weekly for 42 days. Among these, 94.3% completed the follow-up. The PCR-unadjusted cumulative risk of recurrence by day 42 was 4.9% overall, and 3.2% and 6.5% in Mali and Burkina Faso respectively (Hazard Ratio [HR] =2.14, 95%, CI [0.93-4.90]; P=0.070), and higher among the primi- and secundigravida (6.4%) than multigravida (2.2%, HR=3.01 [1.04-8.69]; P=0.042). The PCR-adjusted failure risk was 1.1% overall (Mali 0.8%, Burkina-Faso 1.4%). The frequencies (95% CI) of the dhfr double and triple mutant and dhps 437 and 540 alleles mutant genotype at enrolment were 24.2% (23.7-25.0), 4.7% (4.4-5.0), and 21.4% (20.8-22.0) and 0.37% (0.29-0.44) in Mali, and 7.1% (6.5-7.7), 44.9% (43.8-46.0) and 75.3% (74.5-76.2) and 0% in Burkina-Faso, respectively. There were no dhfr 164L or dhps 581G mutations. CONCLUSION: SP remains effective at clearing existing infections when provided as IPTp to asymptomatic pregnant women in Mali and Burkina.

2461,"Prevalence of Past-Year Sexual Assault Victimization Among Undergraduate Students: Exploring Differences by and Intersections of Gender Identity, Sexual Identity, and Race/Ethnicity A critical step in developing sexual assault prevention and treatment is identifying groups at high risk for sexual assault. We explored the independent and interaction effects of sexual identity, gender identity, and race/ethnicity on past-year sexual assault among college students. From 2011 to 2013, 71,421 undergraduate students from 120 US post-secondary education institutions completed cross-sectional surveys. We fit multilevel logistic regression models to examine differences in past-year sexual assault. Compared to cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) men, cisgender women (adjusted odds ratios [AOR]_=_2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.29, 2.68) and transgender people (AOR_=_3.93; 95% CI 2.68, 5.76) had higher odds of sexual assault. Among cisgender people, gays/lesbians had higher odds of sexual assault than heterosexuals for men (AOR_=_3.50; 95% CI 2.81, 4.35) but not for women (AOR_=_1.13; 95% CI 0.87, 1.46). People unsure of their sexual identity had higher odds of sexual assault than heterosexuals, but effects were larger among cisgender men (AOR_=_2.92; 95% CI 2.10, 4.08) than cisgender women (AOR_=_1.68; 95% CI 1.40, 2.02). Bisexuals had higher odds of sexual assault than heterosexuals with similar magnitude among cisgender men (AOR_=_3.19; 95% CI 2.37, 4.27) and women (AOR_=_2.31; 95% CI 2.05, 2.60). Among transgender people, Blacks had higher odds of sexual assault than Whites (AOR_=_8.26; 95% CI 1.09, 62.82). Predicted probabilities of sexual assault ranged from 2.6 (API cisgender men) to 57.7% (Black transgender people). Epidemiologic research and interventions should consider intersections of gender identity, sexual identity, and race/ethnicity to better tailor sexual assault prevention and treatment for college students.",,,3,,,
2462,"Modeling Area-Level Health Rankings OBJECTIVE: Rank county health using a Bayesian factor analysis model. DATA SOURCES: Secondary county data from the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2007) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (through 2009). STUDY DESIGN: Our model builds on the existing county health rankings (CHRs) by using data-derived weights to compute ranks from mortality and morbidity variables, and by quantifying uncertainty based on population, spatial correlation, and missing data. We apply our model to Wisconsin, which has comprehensive data, and Texas, which has substantial missing information. DATA COLLECTION METHODS: The data were downloaded from www.countyhealthrankings.org. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our estimated rankings are more similar to the CHRs for Wisconsin than Texas, as the data-derived factor weights are closer to the assigned weights for Wisconsin. The correlations between the CHRs and our ranks are 0.89 for Wisconsin and 0.65 for Texas. Uncertainty is especially severe for Texas given the state's substantial missing data. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of comprehensive CHRs varies from state to state. We advise focusing on the counties that remain among the least healthy after incorporating alternate weighting methods and accounting for uncertainty. Our results also highlight the need for broader geographic coverage in health data. _ Health Research and Educational Trust.",,,1,,,
2463,"Genome-wide association study of sexual maturation in males and females highlights a role for body mass and menarche loci in male puberty Little is known about genes regulating male puberty. Further, while many identified pubertal timing variants associate with age at menarche, a late manifestation of puberty, and body mass, little is known about these variants' relationship to pubertal initiation or tempo. To address these questions, we performed genome-wide association meta-analysis in over 11 000 European samples with data on early pubertal traits, male genital and female breast development, measured by the Tanner scale. We report the first genome-wide significant locus for male sexual development upstream of myocardin-like 2 (MKL2) (P = 8.9 _ 10(-9)), a menarche locus tagging a developmental pathway linking earlier puberty with reduced pubertal growth (P = 4.6 _ 10(-5)) and short adult stature (p = 7.5 _ 10(-6)) in both males and females. Furthermore, our results indicate that a proportion of menarche loci are important for pubertal initiation in both sexes. Consistent with epidemiological correlations between increased prepubertal body mass and earlier pubertal timing in girls, body mass index (BMI)-increasing alleles correlated with earlier breast development. In boys, some BMI-increasing alleles associated with earlier, and others with delayed, sexual development; these genetic results mimic the controversy in epidemiological studies, some of which show opposing correlations between prepubertal BMI and male puberty. Our results contribute to our understanding of the pubertal initiation program in both sexes and indicate that although mechanisms regulating pubertal onset in males and females may largely be shared, the relationship between body mass and pubertal timing in boys may be complex and requires further genetic studies. _ The Author 2014.

2464,"Houston's rapid ozone increases: preconditions and geographic origins Many of Houston's highest 8-h ozone (O3) peaks are characterised by increases in concentrations of at least 40 ppb in 1 h, or 60 ppb in 2 h. These rapid increases are called non-typical O3 changes (NTOCs). In 2004, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) developed a novel emissions control strategy aimed at eliminating NTOCs. The strategy limited routine and short-term emissions of ethene, propene, 1,3-butadiene and butene isomers, collectively called highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOCs), which are released from petrochemical facilities. HRVOCs have been associated with NTOCs through field campaigns and modelling studies. This study analysed wind measurements and O3, formaldehyde (HCHO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations from 2000 to 2011 at 25 ground monitors in Houston. NTOCs almost always occurred when monitors were downwind of petrochemical facilities. Rapid O3 increases were associated with low wind speeds; 75 % of NTOCs occurred when the 3-h average wind speed preceding the event was less than 6.5 km h-1. Statistically significant differences in HCHO concentrations were seen between days with and without NTOCs. Early afternoon HCHO concentrations were greater on NTOC days. In the morning before an observed NTOC event, however, there were no significant differences in HCHO concentrations between days with and without NTOCs. Hourly SO2 concentrations also increased rapidly, exhibiting behaviour similar to NTOCs. Oftentimes, the SO2 increases preceded a NTOC. These findings show that, despite the apparent success of targeted HRVOC emission controls, further restrictions may be needed to eliminate the remaining O3 events.",,,1,,,

2466,"Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: a systematic review Influenza viruses circulate around the world every year. From time to time new strains emerge and cause global pandemics. Many national and international health agencies recommended the use of face masks during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. We reviewed the English-language literature on this subject to inform public health preparedness. There is some evidence to support the wearing of masks or respirators during illness to protect others, and public health emphasis on mask wearing during illness may help to reduce influenza virus transmission. There are fewer data to support the use of masks or respirators to prevent becoming infected. Further studies in controlled settings and studies of natural infections in healthcare and community settings are required to better define the effectiveness of face masks and respirators in preventing influenza virus transmission.",,,7,,,

2468,"Baboons as a model to study genetics and epigenetics of human disease A major challenge for understanding susceptibility to common human diseases is determining genetic and environmental factors that influence mechanisms underlying variation in disease-related traits. The most common diseases afflicting the US population are complex diseases that develop as a result of defects in multiple genetically controlled systems in response to environmental challenges. Unraveling the etiology of these diseases is exceedingly difficult because of the many genetic and environmental factors involved. Studies of complex disease genetics in humans are challenging because it is not possible to control pedigree structure and often not practical to control environmental conditions over an extended period of time. Furthermore, access to tissues relevant to many diseases from healthy individuals is quite limited. The baboon is a well-established research model for the study of a wide array of common complex diseases, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and osteoporosis. It is possible to acquire tissues from healthy, genetically characterized baboons that have been exposed to defined environmental stimuli. In this review, we describe the genetic and physiologic similarity of baboons with humans, the ability and usefulness of controlling environment and breeding, and current genetic and genomic resources. We discuss studies on genetics of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and intrauterine growth restriction using the baboon as a model for human disease. We also summarize new studies and resources under development, providing examples of potential translational studies for targeted interventions and therapies for human disease.",,,1,,,
2469,"Contribution of major food companies and their products to household dietary sodium purchases in Australia BACKGROUND: The Australian federal government will soon release voluntary sodium reduction targets for 30 packaged food categories through the Healthy Food Partnership. Previous assessments of voluntary targets show variable industry engagement, and little is known about the extent that major food companies and their products contribute to dietary sodium purchases among Australian households. METHODS: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify the relative contribution that food companies and their products made to Australian household sodium purchases in 2018, and to examine differences in sodium purchases by household income level. We used 1 year of grocery purchase data from a nationally representative consumer panel of Australian households who reported their grocery purchases (the Nielsen Homescan panel), combined with database that contains product-specific sodium content for packaged foods and beverages (FoodSwitch). The top food companies and food categories were ranked according to their contribution to household sodium purchases. Differences in per capita sodium purchases by income levels were assessed by 1-factor ANOVA. All analyses were modelled to the Australian population in 2018 using sample weights. RESULTS: Sodium data were available from 7188 households who purchased 26,728 unique products and purchased just under 7.5 million food product units. Out of 1329 food companies, the top 10 accounted for 35% of unique products and contributed to 58% of all sodium purchased from packaged foods and beverages. The top three companies were grocery food retailers each contributing 12-15% of sodium purchases from sales of their private label products, particularly processed meat, cheese and bread. Out of the 67 food categories, the top 10 accounted for 73% of sodium purchased, particularly driven by purchases of processed meat (14%), bread (12%) and sauces (11%). Low-income Australian households purchased significantly more sodium from packaged products than high-income households per capita (452__g/d, 95%CI: 363-540__g/d, P_< _0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A small number of food companies and food categories account for most of the dietary sodium purchased by Australian households. Prioritizing government engagement with these groups could deliver a large reduction in population sodium intake.",,,1,,,
2470,"Awareness is not enough: the need to increase meningococcal vaccine uptake OBJECTIVE: Adolescent meningococcal vaccine uptake remains low. We examined vaccine awareness among parents of adolescents and uptake. METHODS: Parents of adolescents aged 11 to 17 years (n = 1281) participated in a statewide survey. Logistic regression with weighted data provided population-based estimates. RESULTS: In all, 65% had heard of meningococcal vaccine; parents more likely to report awareness had adolescents aged 16 to 17 years, in private school, or with health insurance. In total, 44% of aware parents reported vaccination; vaccinated teens were more likely to be black (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17), had a preventive checkup within 12 months (OR = 3.03), or resided with another child _18 years (OR = 1.83). Many parents of unvaccinated adolescents (38.5%) did not plan to vaccinate them within 12 months. The most common reasons for not vaccinating were providers not recommending it and believing adolescents did not need it. CONCLUSION: Many parents aware of meningococcal vaccine did not vaccinate their adolescents. Interventions that include increasing provider recommendation and annual visits may increase uptake.",,,0,,,
2471,"Roles and strategies of state organizations related to school-based physical education and physical activity policies School-based physical education (PE) and physical activity (PA) policies can improve PA levels of students and promote health. Studies of policy implementation, communication, monitoring, enforcement, and evaluation are lacking. To describe how states implement, communicate, monitor, enforce, and evaluate key school-based PE and PA policies, researchers interviewed 24 key informants from state-level organizations in 9 states, including representatives from state departments of health and education, state boards of education, and advocacy/professional organizations. These states educate 27% of the US student population. Key informants described their organizations' roles in addressing 14 school-based PE and PA state laws and regulations identified by the Bridging the Gap research program and the National Cancer Institute's Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (C.L.A.S.S.) system. On average, states had 4 of 14 school-based PE and PA laws and regulations, and more than one-half of respondents reported different policies in practice besides the ""on the books"" laws. Respondents more often reported roles implementing and communicating policies compared with monitoring, enforcing, and evaluating them. Implementation and communication strategies used included training, technical assistance, and written communication of policy to local education agency administrators and teachers. State-level organizations have varying roles in addressing school-based PE and PA policies. Opportunities exist to focus state-level efforts on compliance with existing laws and regulations and evaluation of their impact.",,,0,,,
2472,"Driven to Support: Individual- and County-Level Factors Associated With Public Support for Active Transportation Policies PURPOSE: To assess predictors of stated support for policies promoting physically active transportation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: US counties selected on county-level physical activity and obesity health status. PARTICIPANTS: Participants completing random-digit dialed telephone survey (n = 906). MEASURES: Survey measures assessed stated support for 5 policies to promote physically active transportation, access to active transportation facilities, and time spent in a car. County-level estimates included household car dependence and funding for bicycle-pedestrian projects. ANALYSIS: Multivariable generalized linear mixed models using binary distribution and logit link, accounting for clustering within county. RESULTS: Respondents supported policies for accommodating bicyclists and pedestrians through street improvements (89%), school active transportation programs (75%), employer-funded active commuting incentives (67%), and allocation of public funding (68%) and tax support (56%) for building and maintaining public transit. Residents spending >2 h/d (vs < 0.7 hours) in cars were more likely to support street (odds ratio [OR]: 1.87; confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-3.22) and public transit (OR: 1.85; CI: 1.24-2.77) improvements. Residents in counties investing >$1.6 million in bicycle and pedestrian improvements expressed greater support for funding (OR: 1.71; CI: 1.04-2.83) and tax increases (OR: 1.73; CI: 1.08-2.75) for transit improvements compared to those with lower prior investments (< $276 100). CONCLUSION: Support for policies to enable active transportation is higher where relevant investments in active transportation infrastructure are large (>$1.6 M), public transit is nearby, and respondents drive >2 h/d.",,,0,,,
2473,"Vitamin D status and its associations with disease activity and severity in African Americans with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and the associations of vitamin D concentration with disease status in African Americans with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Study participants (n = 266) were enrolled in the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African Americans with Early RA (CLEAR) Registry. The vitamin 25(OH)-D was measured on baseline plasma, and associations of 25(OH)-D with disease status (baseline and at 3 years' disease duration) were examined using univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of 25(OH)-D insufficiency (< or= 37.5 nmol/l or 15 ng/ml) was 50%, with the highest prevalence in winter. In unadjusted analyses, vitamin D concentrations were inversely associated with baseline pain (p = 0.04), swollen joints (p = 0.04), and Disease Activity Score (DAS28, p = 0.05) but not with measures at 3 years' disease duration. There were no multivariate associations of 25(OH)-D with any disease measures at baseline or at 3 years, with the exception of a positive borderline association with rheumatoid factor positivity at enrollment (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D insufficiency is common in African Americans with recent-onset RA. Unadjusted associations of circulating vitamin D with baseline pain, swollen joints, and DAS28 were explained by differences in season, age, and gender and were not significant in multivariate analyses. In contrast to reports of Northern Europeans with early inflammatory arthritis, there are not strong associations of 25(OH)-D concentration with symptoms or disease severity in African Americans with RA.",,,3,,,
2474,"Not all non-drinkers with HIV are equal: demographic and clinical comparisons among current non-drinkers with and without a history of prior alcohol use disorders Studies of persons living with HIV (PLWH) have compared current non-drinkers to at-risk drinkers without differentiating whether current non-drinkers had a prior alcohol use disorder (AUD). The purpose of this study was to compare current non-drinkers with and without a prior AUD on demographic and clinical characteristics to understand the impact of combining them. We included data from six sites across the US from 1/2013 to 3/2015. Patients completed tablet-based clinical assessments at routine clinic appointments using the most recent assessment. Current non-drinkers were identified by AUDIT-C scores of 0. We identified a prior probable AUD by a prior AUD diagnosis in the electronic medical record (EMR) or a report of attendance at alcohol treatment in the clinical assessment. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine factors associated with prior AUD. Among 2235 PLWH who were current non-drinkers, 36% had a prior AUD with more patients with an AUD identified by the clinical assessment than the EMR. Higher proportions with a prior AUD were male, depressed, and reported current drug use compared to non-drinkers without a prior AUD. Former cocaine/crack (70% vs. 25%), methamphetamine/crystal (49% vs. 16%), and opioid/heroin use (35% vs. 7%) were more commonly reported by those with a prior AUD. In adjusted analyses, male sex, past methamphetamine/crystal use, past marijuana use, past opioid/heroin use, past and current cocaine/crack use, and cigarette use were associated with a prior AUD. In conclusion, this study found that among non-drinking PLWH in routine clinical care, 36% had a prior AUD. We found key differences between those with and without prior AUD in demographic and clinical characteristics, including drug use and depression. These results suggest that non-drinkers are heterogeneous and need further differentiation in studies and that prior alcohol misuse (including alcohol treatment) should be included in behavioural health assessments as part of clinical care.",,,6,,,
2475,"Types of Myocardial Infarction Among Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Individuals in the United States Importance: The Second Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) divides MIs into different types. Type 1 MIs result spontaneously from instability of atherosclerotic plaque, whereas type 2 MIs occur in the setting of a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply, as with severe hypotension. Type 2 MIs are uncommon in the general population, but their frequency in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is unknown. Objectives: To characterize MIs, including type; identify causes of type 2 MIs; and compare demographic and clinical characteristics among HIV-infected individuals with type 1 vs type 2 MIs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal study identified potential MIs among patients with HIV receiving clinical care at 6 US sites from January 1, 1996, to March 1, 2014, using diagnoses and cardiac biomarkers recorded in the centralized data repository. Sites assembled deidentified packets, including physician notes and electrocardiograms, procedures, and clinical laboratory tests. Two physician experts adjudicated each event, categorizing each definite or probable MI as type 1 or type 2 and identifying the causes of type 2 MI. Main Outcomes and Measures: The number and proportion of type 1 vs type 2 MIs, demographic and clinical characteristics among those with type 1 vs type 2 MIs, and the causes of type 2 MIs. Results: Among 571 patients (median age, 49 years [interquartile range, 43-55 years]; 430 men and 141 women) with definite or probable MIs, 288 MIs (50.4%) were type 2 and 283 (49.6%) were type 1. In analyses of type 1 MIs, 79 patients who underwent cardiac interventions, such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were also included, totaling 362 patients. Sepsis or bacteremia (100 [34.7%]) and recent use of cocaine or other illicit drugs (39 [13.5%]) were the most common causes of type 2 MIs. A higher proportion of patients with type 2 MIs were younger than 40 years (47 of 288 [16.3%] vs 32 of 362 [8.8%]) and had lower current CD4 cell counts (median, 230 vs 383 cells/_L), lipid levels (mean [SD] total cholesterol level, 167 [63] vs 190 [54] mg/dL, and mean (SD) Framingham risk scores (8% [7%] vs 10% [8%]) than those with type 1 MIs or who underwent cardiac interventions. Conclusions and Relevance: Approximately half of all MIs among HIV-infected individuals were type 2 MIs caused by heterogeneous clinical conditions, including sepsis or bacteremia and recent use of cocaine or other illicit drugs. Demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors among those with type 1 and type 2 MIs differed, suggesting the need to specifically consider type among HIV-infected individuals to further understand MI outcomes and to guide prevention and treatment.",,,5,,,
2476,"Recruitment of young adults for weight gain prevention: randomized comparison of direct mail strategies BACKGROUND: Recruiting young adults (ages 18-35 years) into weight gain prevention intervention studies is challenging and men are particularly difficult to reach. This paper describes two studies designed to improve recruitment for a randomized trial of weight gain prevention interventions. Study 1 used a quasi-experimental design to test the effect of two types of direct mailings on their overall reach. Study 2 used a randomized design to test the effect of using targeted messages to increase recruitment of men into the trial. METHODS: For Study 1, 60,000 male and female young-adult households were randomly assigned to receive either a recruitment brochure or postcard. Visits to recruitment websites during each mailing period were used to assess response to each mailing. Study 2 focused on postcard recruitment only. These households received either a targeted or generic recruitment postcard, where targeted postcards included the word ""Men"" in the headline text. Response rates to each type of card were categorized based on participant report of mailing received. RESULTS: The reach of the postcards and brochures were similar (421 and 386 website visits, respectively; P_=_0.22). Individuals who received the brochure were more likely to initiate the online screener than those who received a postcard (P_=_0.01). In Study 2, of those who completed the telephone screening, 60.9_% of men (n_=_23) had received the targeted postcard as compared to the generic postcard (39.1_%, P_=_0.30). The reverse was true for women (n_=_62, 38.7 vs. 61.3_%, P_=_0.08). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest there was little difference in the reach of postcards versus brochures. However, recipients of brochures were more likely to continue to the next stage of study participation. As expected, men's response to the weight gain prevention messages was lower than women's response; but using targeted messages appears to have modestly increased the proportion of male respondents. These studies add to the limited experimental literature on recruitment messaging and provide further indication for using targeted messages to reach underrepresented populations while providing initial evidence on the effect of mailing type on message reach. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Study of Novel Approaches to Weight Gain Prevention was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01183689 ) on 13 August 2010.",,,1,,,
2477,"Weight loss strategies utilized in a men's weight loss intervention Men are underrepresented in weight loss programs and little is currently known about the weight loss strategies men prefer. This study describes the weight loss strategies used by men during a men-only weight loss program. At baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, participants reported how frequently they used 45 weight loss strategies including strategies frequently recommended by the program (i.e., mentioned during every intervention contact; e.g., daily self-weighing), strategies occasionally recommended by the program (i.e., mentioned at least once during the program; e.g., reduce calories from beverages), and strategies not included in the program (e.g., increase daily steps). At baseline participants ( N = 107, 44.2 years, body mass index = 31.4 kg/m2, 76.6% White) reported regularly using 7.3 _ 6.6 ( M _ SD) strategies. The intervention group increased the number of strategies used to 19.1 _ 8.3 at 3 months and 17.1 _ 8.4 at 6 months with no changes in the waitlist group. The intervention group reported increased use of most of the strategies frequently recommended by the program (4 of 5), nearly half of the strategies occasionally recommended by the program (10 of 24), and one strategy not included in the program (of 16) at 6 months. The intervention effect at 6 months was significantly mediated by the number of strategies used at 3 months. This study adds to what is known about men's use of weight loss strategies prior to and during a formal weight loss program and will help future program developers create programs that are tailored to men.",,,6,,,
2478,"Theoretical and behavioral mediators of a weight loss intervention for men OBJECTIVE: Men are currently underrepresented in weight loss trials despite similar obesity rates, which limit our understanding about the most effective elements of treatment for men. The purpose of this study was to test the theoretical (autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and self-regulation) and behavioral (calorie intake, physical activity, self-weighing) mediators of a men-only, Internet-delivered weight loss intervention focused on innovative and tailored treatment elements specifically for men. METHOD: Data comes from a 6-month randomized trial (N_=_107) testing the intervention compared to a waitlist control group. Changes in the theoretical mediators between baseline and 3_months were tested as mediators of the intervention effect on weight change at 6_months in both single and multiple mediator models. Changes in behaviors between baseline and 6_months were tested in the same manner. RESULTS: The intervention produced greater weight losses compared to the control group (-5.57_kg___6.6 vs. -0.65_kg___3.3, p_< _0.001) and significant changes (p's_< _0.05) in most of the theoretical and behavior mediators. In multiple mediator models, changes in diet-related autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, and self-regulation all significantly mediated the relationship between the intervention and weight loss. The intervention effect was also mediated by changes in dietary intake and self-weighing frequency. CONCLUSIONS: By testing the theoretical mediators of this intervention in a multiple mediator context, this study contributes to current knowledge related to the development of weight loss interventions for men and suggests that interventions should target diet-focused constructs.",,,4,,,
2479,"Conceptualizing and comparing neighborhood and activity space measures for food environment research Greater accessibility to geospatial technologies has led to a surge of spatialized public health research, much of which has focused on food environments.

Exposure measures were derived using participant-defined neighborhoods, investigator-defined road network neighborhoods, and activity spaces incorporating participants_ time space behaviors. Results showed that mean area for participant-defined neighborhoods (0.04 sq. miles) was much smaller than 2.0 mile road network neighborhoods (3.11 sq. miles) and activity spaces (26.36 sq. miles), and that activity spaces provided the greatest market exposure. The traditional residential neighborhood concept may not be particularly relevant for all places.

2480,"HIV Testing and ART Adherence Among Unstably Housed Black Men Who Have Sex with Men in the United States Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) have the highest HIV incidence rate among all MSM in the United States (US), and are also disproportionately affected by homelessness and housing instability. However, little is known about the effects of homelessness on the HIV testing and care continuum for BMSM. Between 2014 and 2017, the Promoting Our Worth, Equality, and Resilience (POWER) study collected data and offered HIV testing to 4184 BMSM at Black Pride events in six US cities. Bivariate analyses were used to assess differences in sociodemographics and healthcare access between BMSM who self-reported homelessness and those who did not. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess differences in HIV testing by homelessness status. Finally, bivariate and multivariable models were used to assess differences in HIV care continuum and treatment adherence outcomes by homelessness status. 615 (12.1%) BMSM in our sample experienced homelessness in the last 12_months. BMSM who self-reported homelessness had higher odds of receiving an HIV test in the past 6_months compared to their stably housed counterparts. BMSM who self-reported homelessness had higher odds of reporting difficulty taking ART and of missing a dose in the past week compared to stably housed BMSM. Findings suggest that HIV testing outreach and treatment-related services targeting unstably housed BMSM may be effective. Future community-based research is needed to investigate how homelessness and housing instability affect ART adherence, and how this population may experience success in HIV testing and adherence despite economic and social marginalization.",,,6,,,
2481,"Formative research to explore the acceptability and use of infant food grinders for the promotion of animal source foods and micronutrient powders in rural Peru According to global recommendations, quality diets for complementary feeding (CF) should include a diversity of foods including vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables and sources of high-quality proteins and essential nutrients, particularly animal-source foods (ASF). A key barrier to feeding ASF surrounds beliefs that the preparation of foods of a thicker consistency may cause problems of digestion, ""heaviness"" or stomach problems, swallowing, and choking. The objective of this study was to explore, through systematic formative research, the acceptability, use, and feasibility of a simple technology, commercial infant food grinders, in two rural Peruvian settings where there is delayed and low consumption of complementary foods of a thick consistency, including ASF. Phase I explored the barriers, constraints, and opportunities related to the provision of foods of a thicker consistency with a focus on ASF. Phase II encompassed household behavioural trials with mothers and infants to assess the acceptability and use of the grinders in the home setting, using key concepts and messages developed from the information obtained during Phase I. The technology was highly acceptable, used by the majority of mothers (87.8%), and led to changes in cultural perceptions, facilitating increased feeding of appropriate textures (thick purees), ASF, and multimicronutrient powders. Energy, protein, and micronutrient intakes were all significantly greater after the household behavioural trials. This simple technology, paired with systematic formative research to appropriately promote its use across cultures, may have a significant effect on improving CF practices globally, particularly for young infants beginning CF at 6_months. _ 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,4,,,
2482,"The Relationship Between Discrimination and Missed HIV Care Appointments Among Women Living with HIV Receiving regular HIV care is crucial for maintaining good health among persons with HIV. However, racial and gender disparities in HIV care receipt exist. Discrimination and its impact may vary by race/ethnicity and gender, contributing to disparities. Data from 1578 women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study ascertained from 10/1/2012 to 9/30/2016 were used to: (1) estimate the relationship between discrimination and missing any scheduled HIV care appointments and (2) assess whether this relationship is effect measure modified by race/ethnicity. Self-reported measures captured discrimination and the primary outcome of missing any HIV care appointments in the last 6_months. Log-binomial models accounting for measured sources of confounding and selection bias were fit. For the primary outcome analyses, women experiencing discrimination typically had a higher prevalence of missing an HIV care appointment. Moreover, there was no statistically significant evidence for effect measure modification by race/ethnicity. Interventions to minimize discrimination or its impact may improve HIV care engagement among women.",,,6,,,
2483,"An Automated High-throughput Array Microscope for Cancer Cell Mechanics Changes in cellular mechanical properties correlate with the progression of metastatic cancer along the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Few high-throughput methodologies exist that measure cell compliance, which can be used to understand the impact of genetic alterations or to screen the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. We have developed a novel array high-throughput microscope (AHTM) system that combines the convenience of the standard 96-well plate with the ability to image cultured cells and membrane-bound microbeads in twelve independently-focusing channels simultaneously, visiting all wells in eight steps. We use the AHTM and passive bead rheology techniques to determine the relative compliance of human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells, h-TERT transformed HPDE cells (HPNE), and four gain-of-function constructs related to EMT. The AHTM found HPNE, H-ras, Myr-AKT, and Bcl2 transfected cells more compliant relative to controls, consistent with parallel tests using atomic force microscopy and invasion assays, proving the AHTM capable of screening for changes in mechanical phenotype.",,,1,,,
2484,"Development and testing of a tool for assessing and resolving medication-related problems in older adults in an ambulatory care setting: the individualized medication assessment and planning (iMAP) tool BACKGROUND: Medication is one of the most important interventions for improving the health of older adults, yet it has great potential for causing harm. Clinical pharmacists are well positioned to engage in medication assessment and planning. The Individualized Medication Assessment and Planning (iMAP) tool was developed to aid clinical pharmacists in documenting medication-related problems (MRPs) and associated recommendations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to assess the reliability and usability of the iMAP tool in classifying MRPs and associated recommendations in older adults in the ambulatory care setting. METHODS: Three cases, representative of older adults seen in an outpatient setting, were developed. Pilot testing was conducted and a ""gold standard"" key developed. Eight eligible pharmacists consented to participate in the study. They were instructed to read each case, make an assessment of MRPs, formulate a plan, and document the information using the iMAP tool. Inter-rater reliability was assessed for each case, comparing the pharmacists' identified MRPs and recommendations to the gold standard. Consistency of categorization across reviewers was assessed using the _ statistic or percent agreement. RESULTS: The mean _ across the 8 pharmacists in classifying MRPs compared with the gold standard was 0.74 (range, 0.54-1.00) for case 1 and 0.68 (range, 0.36-1.00) for case 2, indicating substantial agreement. For case 3, percent agreement was 63% (range, 40%-100%). The mean _ across the 8 pharmacists when classifying recommendations compared with the gold standard was 0.87 (range, 0.58-1.00) for case 1 and 0.88 (range, 0.75-1.00) for case 2, indicating almost perfect agreement. For case 3, percent agreement was 68% (range, 40%-100%). Clinical pharmacists found the iMAP tool easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: The iMAP tool provides a reliable and standardized approach for clinical pharmacists to use in the ambulatory care setting to classify MRPs and associated recommendations. Future studies will explore the predictive validity of the tool on clinical outcomes such as health care utilization. Copyright _ 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
2485,"The university of north carolina's health care pharmacy assistance progam BACKGROUND: UNC Health Care has a Pharmacy Assistance Program (PAP) that provides financial assistance to uninsured patients in North Carolina who need prescription medications. Despite significant investment in the program, little is known about the patients accessing it or the specific health care services they use. Our objectives were to describe the PAP population, to examine their use of prescription medications and health services, and to characterize changes in prescription medication use and expenditures from 2009 through 2011. METHODS: We used a repeated cross-sectional study design, merging prescription claims with health records from Carolina Data Warehouse for Health, to measure use of prescription medications and use of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department care by PAP participants. Prescription claims were grouped into therapeutic categories. We generated descriptive statistics for key variables to examine health service utilization from 2009 through 2011. RESULTS: From 2009 through 2011, PAP served 7,180 patients from 81 counties in North Carolina. PAP users received a mean of 23 prescriptions, at an average cost of $754 per recipient per year. An average of $2.93 million per year was spent on the program, with an 8% rise in spending from 2009 to 2011. Inpatient care and emergency department care were utilized by 30% and 31% of PAP users, respectively, and there was minimal change in these rates over 3 years. LIMITATIONS: Data were limited to medications dispensed through PAP and to health services provided by UNC Health Care. CONCLUSIONS: With the state's decision to not expand Medicaid, PAP will continue to be an important resource for North Carolina's low income citizens.",,,6,,,
2486,"Neighborhood Racial Diversity, Socioeconomic Status, and Perceptions of HIV-Related Discrimination and Internalized HIV Stigma Among Women Living with HIV in the United States Relationships that traverse sociodemographic categories may improve community attitudes toward marginalized groups and potentially protect members of those groups from stigma and discrimination. The present study evaluated whether internalized HIV stigma and perceived HIV-related discrimination in health care settings differ based on individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics of women living with HIV (WLHIV). We also sought to extend previous conceptual and empirical work to explore whether perceived HIV-related discrimination mediated the association between neighborhood racial diversity and internalized HIV stigma. A total of 1256 WLHIV in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) attending 10 sites in metropolitan areas across the United States completed measures of internalized HIV stigma and perceived HIV-related discrimination in health care settings. Participants also provided residential information that was geocoded into Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes and linked with census-tract level indicators. In cross-sectional analyses, greater neighborhood racial diversity was associated with less internalized HIV stigma and less perceived HIV-related discrimination regardless of individual race. Neighborhood median income was positively associated with internalized HIV stigma and perceived discrimination, while individual income was negatively associated with perceptions of stigma and discrimination. In an exploratory mediation analysis, neighborhood racial diversity had a significant indirect effect on internalized HIV stigma through perceived HIV-related discrimination. An indirect effect between neighborhood income and internalized stigma was not supported. These findings suggest that greater neighborhood racial diversity may lessen HIV stigma processes at the individual level and that HIV stigma-reduction interventions may be most needed in communities that lack racial diversity.",,,6,,,
2487,"Inverse relationship between moderate alcohol intake and rectal cancer: analysis of the North Carolina Colon Cancer Study BACKGROUND: The relationship between alcohol intake and rectal cancer is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether alcohol consumption is associated with distal colorectal cancer and rectal cancer specifically. DESIGN: Data on alcohol intake were examined from the North Carolina Colon Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study of distal colorectal cancer. SETTING: This study encompassed 33 counties in the central and eastern part of North Carolina. PATIENTS: Cases had adenocarcinoma of the rectum, rectosigmoid, and sigmoid colon. Controls were frequency-matched on age, race, and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Demographic and dietary intake data were collected with use of a validated questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for the relationship between alcohol consumption and distal colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Included in the study were 1033 cases and 1011 controls. The odds ratio for rectal cancer comparing any vs no alcohol intake was 0.73 (95% CI 0.60, 0.90), adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking status, obesity, education, red meat intake, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and family history of colorectal cancer. The odds ratio for moderate alcohol (_14 g/day) was 0.66 (95% CI 0.53, 0.82), whereas the odds ratio for heavy alcohol (>14 g/day) was 0.93 (95% CI 0.70, 1.23). Moderate beer and wine intakes were also inversely associated with distal colorectal cancer: odds ratios 0.76 (95% CI 0.60, 0.96) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.56, 0.86). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective, observational study. Residual confounding is possible. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, moderate alcohol intake (especially wine) was inversely associated with distal colorectal cancer.",,,3,,,
2488,"Isotretinoin use and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study OBJECTIVES: Isotretinoin is commonly prescribed for the treatment of severe acne. Although cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in isotretinoin users, a causal association remains unproven. METHODS: We performed a case-control study using a large insurance claims database. Incident cases of IBD were identified and matched to three controls on the basis of age, gender, geographical region, health plan, and length of enrollment. Isotretinoin exposure was assessed in a 12-month period before case ascertainment. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for matching variables. RESULTS: The study population comprised 8,189 cases (3,664 Crohn's disease (CD), 4,428 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 97 IBD unspecified) and 21,832 controls. A total of 60 subjects (24 cases and 36 controls) were exposed to isotretinoin. UC was strongly associated with previous isotretinoin exposure (odds ratio (OR) 4.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.97, 9.66). However, there was no apparent association between isotretinoin and CD (OR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.28, 1.68). Increasing dose of isotretinoin was associated with elevated risk of UC (OR per 20 mg increase in dose: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.09). Compared with non-users, the risk of UC was highest in those exposed to isotretinoin for more than 2 months (OR 5.63, 95% CI: 2.10, 15.03). CONCLUSIONS: UC but not CD is associated with previous isotretinoin exposure. Higher dose of isotretinoin seems to augment this risk. Although the absolute risk of developing UC after taking isotretinoin is likely quite small, clinicians prescribing isotretinoin as well as prospective patients should be aware of this possible association.",,,3,,,

2490,"Sessile serrated adenomas: an evidence-based guide to management The concept of serrated colorectal neoplasia and a serrated pathway to colorectal cancer (CRC) is relatively new and continuing to evolve, but it has become highly relevant to gastroenterologists, pathologist, and oncologists alike. Sessile serrated adenomas (SSA) are now thought to be the major precursor lesion of serrated pathway cancers, which represent up to one-third of all sporadic CRC cases. However, despite their increasingly recognized importance, relatively little is known about the epidemiology and natural history of SSAs, and the molecular and epigenetic aspects are incompletely understood. Endoscopists must be aware of the unique features of SSAs so that the practice of colonoscopic screening for CRC can include optimized detection, removal, and appropriate surveillance of SSAs and other serrated precursor lesions. In this review, we discuss the history, epidemiology, and pathologic aspects of SSAs, as well as a recommended management approach and a discussion of uncertainties and opportunities for future research.

2491,"Emergency care of esophageal foreign body impactions: timing, treatment modalities, and resource utilization Esophageal foreign body impaction (EFBI) often requires urgent evaluation and treatment, but characteristics of emergency department (ED) care such as timing of presentation and therapeutic procedures and costs of care are unknown. We aimed to study health-care utilization for patients with EFBI presenting to the ED. Cases of EFBI from 2002 to 2009 were identified by querying three different databases from the University of North Carolina Hospitals for all records with ICD-9 CM code 935.1: 'foreign body in the esophagus.' Charts were reviewed to confirm EFBI and extract pertinent data related to the ED visit, including time of presentation, length of ED stay, medications administered, type of procedure performed, characteristics of procedures, and time to therapeutic procedure. Hospital charges for EFBI encounters and consult fees were determined from the Physicians' Fee Reference 2010, and were compiled to estimate costs. Of the 548 cases of EFBI identified, 351 subjects (64%) presented to the ED. A total of 118 (34%) patients received a medication to treat EFBI, which was only effective in 8% of those patients. Two hundred ninety (83%) subjects underwent a procedure including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (n=206) or ear, nose, and throat surgery (ENT)-performed laryngoscopy/esophagoscopy (n=138). Admission to the hospital occurred in 162 (46%) of cases. There was no relationship between ED arrival time and time-to-procedure or total time in ED. There was also no significant relationship between delivery of ED medications and likelihood of undergoing a procedure, or between ED arrival time and delivery of medications. The charges associated with a typical EFBI episode ranged from $2284-$6218. In conclusion, the majority of patients with EFBI at our institution presented to the ED. Medical management was largely ineffective. A therapeutic procedure was required to clear the EFBI in most patients. Time of ED arrival made no difference in time-to-procedure, indicating that gastroenterology and ENT specialists recognize the urgency of treating EFBI regardless of time of day. _ 2012 Copyright the Authors.

2492,"HIV-positive Malawian women with young children prefer overweight body sizes and link underweight body size with inability to exclusively breastfeed Before the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) program was widely implemented in Malawi, HIV-positive women associated exclusive breastfeeding with accelerated disease progression and felt that an HIV-positive woman could more successfully breastfeed if she had a larger body size. The relationship between breastfeeding practices and body image perceptions has not been explored in the context of the Option B+ PMTCT program, which offers lifelong antiretroviral therapy. We conducted in-depth interviews with 64 HIV-positive women in Lilongwe District, Malawi to investigate body size perceptions, how perceptions of HIV and body size influence infant feeding practices, and differences in perceptions among women in PMTCT and those lost to follow-up. Women were asked about current, preferred, and healthy body size perceptions using nine body image silhouettes of varying sizes, and vignettes about underweight and overweight HIV-positive characters were used to elicit discussion of breastfeeding practices. More than 80% of women preferred an overweight, obese, or morbidly obese silhouette, and most women (83%) believed that an obese or morbidly obese silhouette was healthy. Although nearly all women believed that an HIV-positive overweight woman could exclusively breastfeed, only about half of women thought that an HIV-positive underweight woman could exclusively breastfeed. These results suggest that perceptions of body size may influence beliefs about a woman's ability to breastfeed. Given the preference for large body sizes and the association between obesity and risk of noncommunicable diseases, we recommend that counseling and health education for HIV-positive Malawian women focus on culturally sensitive healthy weight messaging and its relationship with breastfeeding practices. _ 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,6,,,
2493,"Validity of US norms for the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III in Malawian children OBJECTIVE: Most psychometric tests originate from Europe and North America and have not been validated in other populations. We assessed the validity of United States (US)-based norms for the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (BSID-III), a neurodevelopmental tool developed for and commonly used in the US, in Malawian children. METHODS: We constructed BSID-III norms for cognitive, fine motor (FM), gross motor (GM), expressive communication (EC) and receptive communication (RC) subtests using 5173 tests scores in 167 healthy Malawian children. Norms were generated using Generalized Additive Models for location, scale and shape, with age modeled continuously. Standard z-scores were used to classify neurodevelopmental delay. Weighted kappa statistics were used to compare the classification of neurological development using US-based and Malawian norms. RESULTS: For all subtests, the mean raw scores in Malawian children were higher than the US normative scores at younger ages (approximately < 6 months) after which the mean curves crossed and the US normative mean exceeded that of the Malawian sample and the age at which the curves crossed differed by subtest. Weighted kappa statistics for agreement between US and Malawian norms were 0.45 for cognitive, 0.48 for FM, 0.57 for GM, 0.50 for EC, and 0.44 for RC. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that population reference curves for the BSID-III differ depending on the origin of the population. Reliance on US norm-based standardized scores resulted in misclassification of the neurological development of Malawian children, with the greatest potential for bias in the measurement of cognitive and language skills.

2494,"The effects of health facility access and quality on family planning decisions in urban Senegal Research in developing countries is rarely focused on examining how supply side factors affect family planning decisions due to a lack of facility-level data. When these data exist, analyses tend to focus on rural environments. In this paper, we study the effects that health facility access and quality have on contraceptive use and desired number of children for women in urban Senegal. Unlike related studies focusing on rural environments, we find no evidence that greater access to health facilities and pharmacies increases contraceptive use among urban women. However, we do find that contraceptive use among urban women is higher with greater facility quality. For example, we find that increasing the proportion of pharmacies employing multiple pharmacists from 0% to 50% would increase contraceptive use by 6.0 percentage points, and increasing the proportion of facilities with family planning guidelines/protocols from 50% to 100% would increase use by 2.1 percentage points.

2495,"Measurement Error in Discrete Health Facility Choice Models: an Example from Urban Senegal We use individual-level health facility choice data from urban Senegal to estimate consumer preferences for facility characteristics related to maternal health services. We find that consumers consider a large number of quality related facility characteristics, as well as travel costs, when making their health facility choice. In contrast to the typical assumption in the literature, our findings indicate that individuals frequently bypass the facility nearest their home. In light of this, we show that the mismeasured data used commonly in the literature produces biased preference estimates; most notably, the literature likely overestimates consumer distaste for travel.",,,2,,,
2496,"Genomic Relationships, Novel Loci, and Pleiotropic Mechanisms across Eight Psychiatric Disorders Genetic influences on psychiatric disorders transcend diagnostic boundaries, suggesting substantial pleiotropy of contributing loci. However, the nature and mechanisms of these pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We performed analyses of 232,964 cases and 494,162 controls from genome-wide studies of anorexia nervosa, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome. Genetic correlation analyses revealed a meaningful structure within the eight disorders, identifying three groups of inter-related disorders. Meta-analysis across these eight disorders detected 109 loci associated with at least two psychiatric disorders, including 23 loci with pleiotropic effects on four or more disorders and 11 loci with antagonistic effects on multiple disorders. The pleiotropic loci are located within genes that show heightened expression in the_brain throughout the lifespan, beginning prenatally in the second trimester, and play prominent roles in neurodevelopmental processes. These findings have important implications for psychiatric nosology, drug development, and risk prediction. Copyright _ 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
2497,"Genetic relationship between five psychiatric disorders estimated from genome-wide SNPs Most psychiatric disorders are moderately to highly heritable. The degree to which genetic variation is unique to individual disorders or shared across disorders is unclear. To examine shared genetic etiology, we use genome-wide genotype data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17-29% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 _ 0.04 s.e.), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43 _ 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47 _ 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive disorder (0.32 _ 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and ASD (0.16 _ 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the negative control of Crohn's disease. This empirical evidence of shared genetic etiology for psychiatric disorders can inform nosology and encourages the investigation of common pathophysiologies for related disorders.",,,1,,,
2498,"Genetic variation associated with circulating monocyte count in the eMERGE Network With white blood cell count emerging as an important risk factor for chronic inflammatory diseases, genetic associations of differential leukocyte types, specifically monocyte count, are providing novel candidate genes and pathways to further investigate. Circulating monocytes play a critical role in vascular diseases such as in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. We performed a joint and ancestry-stratified genome-wide association analyses to identify variants specifically associated with monocyte count in 11 014 subjects in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. In the joint and European ancestry samples, we identified novel associations in the chromosome 16 interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) gene (P-value = 2.78_10(-16), _ = -0.22). Other monocyte associations include novel missense variants in the chemokine-binding protein 2 (CCBP2) gene (P-value = 1.88_10(-7), _ = 0.30) and a region of replication found in ribophorin I (RPN1) (P-value = 2.63_10(-16), _ = -0.23) on chromosome 3. The CCBP2 and RPN1 region is located near GATA binding protein2 gene that has been previously shown to be associated with coronary heart disease. On chromosome 9, we found a novel association in the prostaglandin reductase 1 gene (P-value = 2.29_10(-7), _ = 0.16), which is downstream from lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. This region has previously been shown to be associated with monocyte count. We also replicated monocyte associations of genome-wide significance (P-value = 5.68_10(-17), _ = -0.23) at the integrin, alpha 4 gene on chromosome 2.

2499,"Replication of LIN28B SNP association with age of menarche in young Filipino women BACKGROUND: Age of menarche, or the timing of first menses in girls, is a physiological trait that shows substantial genetic heritability. Earlier age of menarche is associated with increased childhood adiposity and with adult risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVES: We sought to further characterize the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7759938 from the menarche locus LIN28B in 827 young Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS). METHODS: We tested rs7759938 for additive association with age of menarche and also tested whether childhood adiposity, as measured by body mass index (BMI) at age 8, mediated this relationship. RESULTS: We observed nominal association of rs7759938 with age of menarche (__=_-0.118 years, 95% confidence interval_=_(-0.216, -0.020), P_=_0.019) with an effect direction consistent with the previous report. We also observed suggestive evidence that the effect of the SNP on age of menarche was independent of childhood BMI.

2500,"Genome-wide association study of anthropometric traits and evidence of interactions with age and study year in Filipino women Increased values of multiple adiposity-related anthropometric traits are important risk factors for many common complex diseases. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) study for four quantitative traits related to body size and adiposity (BMI, weight, waist circumference, and height) in a cohort of 1,792 adult Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS). This is the first GWA study of anthropometric traits in Filipinos, a population experiencing a rapid transition into a more obesogenic environment. In addition to identifying suggestive evidence of additional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association signals (P < 10(-5)), we replicated (P < 0.05, same direction of additive effect) associations previously reported in European populations of both BMI and weight with MC4R and FTO, of BMI with BDNF, and of height with EFEMP1, ZBTB38, and NPPC, but none with waist circumference. We also replicated loci reported in Japanese or Korean populations as associated with BMI (OTOL1) and height (HIST1H1PS2, C14orf145, GPC5). A difference in local linkage disequilibrium (LD) between European and Asian populations suggests a narrowed association region for BDNF, while still including a proposed functional nonsynonymous amino acid substitution variant (rs6265, Val66Met). Finally, we observed significant evidence (P < 0.0042) for age-by-genotype interactions influencing BMI for rs17782313 (MC4R) and rs9939609 (FTO), and for a study year-by-genotype interaction for rs4923461 (BDNF). Our results show that several genetic risk factors are associated with anthropometric traits in Filipinos and provide further insight into the effects of BDNF, FTO, and MC4R on BMI.",,,8,,,
2501,"Population-specific coding variant underlies genome-wide association with adiponectin level Adiponectin is a protein hormone that can affect major metabolic processes including glucose regulation and fat metabolism. Our previous genome-wide association (GWA) study of circulating plasma adiponectin levels in Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) detected a 100 kb two-SNP haplotype at KNG1-ADIPOQ associated with reduced adiponectin (frequency = 0.050, P = 1.8 _ 10(-25)). Subsequent genotyping of CLHNS young adult offspring detected an uncommon variant [minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.025] located ~800 kb from ADIPOQ that showed strong association with lower adiponectin levels (P = 2.7 _ 10(-15), n = 1695) and tagged a subset of KNG1-ADIPOQ haplotype carriers with even lower adiponectin levels. Sequencing of the ADIPOQ-coding region detected variant R221S (MAF = 0.015, P = 2.9 _ 10(-69)), which explained 17.1% of the variance in adiponectin levels and largely accounted for the initial GWA signal in Filipinos. R221S was not present in 12 514 Europeans with previously sequenced exons. To explore the mechanism of this substitution, we re-measured adiponectin level in 20 R221S offspring carriers and 20 non-carriers using two alternative antibodies and determined that the presence of R221S resulted in artificially low quantification of adiponectin level using the original immunoassay. These data provide an example of an uncommon variant responsible for a GWA signal and demonstrate that genetic associations with phenotypes measured by antibody-based quantification methods can be affected by uncommon coding SNPs residing in the antibody target region. _ The Author 2011.

2502,"Frontline Science: A reduction in DHA-derived mediators in male obesity contributes toward defects in select B cell subsets and circulating antibody Obesity dysregulates B cell populations, which contributes toward poor immunological outcomes. We previously reported that differing B cell subsets are lowered in the bone marrow of obese male mice. Here, we focused on how lipid metabolites synthesized from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) known as specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) influence specific B cell populations in obese male mice. Metabololipidomics revealed that splenic SPM precursors 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14-HDHA), 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA), and downstream protectin DX (PDX) were decreased in obese male C57BL/6J mice. Simultaneous administration of these mediators to obese mice rescued major decrements in bone marrow B cells, modest impairments in the spleen, and circulating IgG2c, which is pro-inflammatory in obesity. In vitro studies with B cells, flow cytometry experiments with ALOX5-/- mice, and lipidomic analyses revealed the lowering of 14-HDHA/17-HDHA/PDX and dysregulation of B cell populations in obesity was driven indirectly via B cell extrinsic mechanisms. Notably, the lowering of lipid mediators was associated with an increase in the abundance of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have a high affinity for SPM-generating enzymes. Subsequent experiments revealed female obese mice generally maintained the levels of SPM precursors, B cell subsets, and antibody levels. Finally, obese human females had increased circulating plasma cells accompanied by ex vivo B cell TNF_ and IL-10 secretion. Collectively, the data demonstrate that DHA-derived mediators of the SPM pathway control the number of B cell subsets and pro-inflammatory antibody levels in obese male but not female mice through a defect that is extrinsic to B cells. _2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.",,,1,,,
2503,"Genetics of adverse reactions to haloperidol in a mouse diallel: a drug-placebo experiment and Bayesian causal analysis Haloperidol is an efficacious antipsychotic drug that has serious, unpredictable motor side effects that limit its utility and cause noncompliance in many patients. Using a drug-placebo diallel of the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross and their F1 hybrids, we characterized aggregate effects of genetics, sex, parent of origin, and their combinations on haloperidol response. Treating matched pairs of both sexes with drug or placebo, we measured changes in the following: open field activity, inclined screen rigidity, orofacial movements, prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, plasma and brain drug level measurements, and body weight. To understand the genetic architecture of haloperidol response we introduce new statistical methodology linking heritable variation with causal effect of drug treatment. Our new estimators, ""difference of models"" and ""multiple-impute matched pairs"", are motivated by the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework and extend our existing Bayesian hierarchical model for the diallel (Lenarcic et al. 2012). Drug-induced rigidity after chronic treatment was affected by mainly additive genetics and parent-of-origin effects (accounting for 28% and 14.8% of the variance), with NZO/HILtJ and 129S1/SvlmJ contributions tending to increase this side effect. Locomotor activity after acute treatment, by contrast, was more affected by strain-specific inbreeding (12.8%). In addition to drug response phenotypes, we examined diallel effects on behavior before treatment and found not only effects of additive genetics (10.2-53.2%) but also strong effects of epistasis (10.64-25.2%). In particular: prepulse inhibition showed additivity and epistasis in about equal proportions (26.1% and 23.7%); there was evidence of nonreciprocal epistasis in pretreatment activity and rigidity; and we estimated a range of effects on body weight that replicate those found in our previous work. Our results provide the first quantitative description of the genetic architecture of haloperidol response in mice and indicate that additive, dominance-like inbreeding and parent-of-origin effects contribute strongly to treatment effect heterogeneity for this drug.",,,1,,,
2504,"Analyses of allele-specific gene expression in highly divergent mouse crosses identifies pervasive allelic imbalance Complex human traits are influenced by variation in regulatory DNA through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Because regulatory elements are conserved between humans and mice, a thorough annotation of cis regulatory variants in mice could aid in further characterizing these mechanisms. Here we provide a detailed portrait of mouse gene expression across multiple tissues in a three-way diallel. Greater than 80% of mouse genes have cis regulatory variation. Effects from these variants influence complex traits and usually extend to the human ortholog. Further, we estimate that at least one in every thousand SNPs creates a cis regulatory effect. We also observe two types of parent-of-origin effects, including classical imprinting and a new global allelic imbalance in expression favoring the paternal allele. We conclude that, as with humans, pervasive regulatory variation influences complex genetic traits in mice and provide a new resource toward understanding the genetic control of transcription in mammals.",,,1,,,

The HCHS/SOL examined 16,415 self-identified Hispanic/Latino persons aged 18 to 74 years recruited from randomly selected households using a stratified 2-stage area probability sample design based on census block groups and households within block groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hearing thresholds were measured by pure-tone audiometry. Hearing impairment was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA) of thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz greater than 25 dB hearing level. Bilateral hearing impairment required a PTA greater than 25 dB hearing level in both ears. Multivariable analyses included adjustments for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, body mass index, and medical conditions. RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing impairment was 15.06% (SE, 0.44%) overall, and 8.24% (SE, 0.33%) had bilateral hearing impairment. The prevalence of hearing impairment was higher among people 45 years and older, ranging by Hispanic/Latino background from 29.35% to 41.20% among men and 17.89% to 32.11% among women. The multivariable-adjusted odds of hearing impairment was greater for participants of Puerto Rican background compared with Mexican background (odds ratio [OR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.10-2.25]). The odds of hearing impairment were lower with more education (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59-0.86] for at least high school) and higher income (OR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36-0.92] for >$75,000 vs _$10,000). Noise exposure (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.07-1.70]), diabetes (OR, 1.57 [95% CI,_1.27-1.94]), and prediabetes (OR, 1.37 [95% CI,_1.12-1.67]) were associated with hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hearing impairment is a common problem for older Hispanics/Latinos in these communities and is associated with socioeconomic factors, noise exposure, and abnormal glucose metabolism. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these factors are involved in the etiology of hearing impairment and to identify ways to prevent or delay age-related changes in hearing.",,,3,,,
2507,"Timing of complementary food introduction and age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: the SEARCH nutrition ancillary study (SNAS) The association between timing of complementary food introduction and age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was investigated among 1077 children in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study. Age at diagnosis was 5 months earlier for children introduced to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) in the first 12 months of life compared with those who were not (9.0_0.2 vs 9.5_0.1; P=0.02) independent of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk status. Analyses stratified by HLA risk status found that children with a high-risk HLA genotype had an earlier age at diagnosis if they were introduced to fruit juice in the first year of life (mean age at diagnosis=9.3_0.1, 9.1_0.1 and 9.6_0.2 for introduction at _6 months, between 7 and 11 months and _12 months, respectively; P=0.04). Introduction of SSB in the first year of life may accelerate the onset of type 1 diabetes independent of HLA risk status.",,,4,,,
2508,"Factors influencing time to case registration for youth with type 1_and type 2 diabetes: SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study PURPOSE: The development of a sustainable pediatric diabetes surveillance system for the United States requires a better understanding of issues related to case ascertainment. METHODS: Using the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth registry, we examined whether time from diabetes diagnosis to case registration differed by diabetes type, patient demographics, and the type of provider reporting the case to the study. Plots for time from diagnosis to registration were developed, and differences by key variables were examined using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Compared with time to registration for type 1 cases, it took 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-2.6) times longer to register 50% of type 2 diabetes cases, and 2.3 (95% CI, 2.0-2.5) times longer to register 90% of type 2 cases. For type 1 diabetes cases, a longer time to registration was associated with older age, minority race/ethnicity, and cases, where the referring provider was not an endocrinologist. For type 2 diabetes cases, older age, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, and cases reported by providers other than an endocrinologist took longer to identify and register. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the need for continued childhood diabetes surveillance to identify future trends and influences on changes in prevalence and incidence.

2509,"The impact of neonatal breast-feeding on growth trajectories of youth exposed and unexposed to diabetes in utero: the EPOCH Study OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of breast-feeding on the body mass index (BMI) growth trajectory from birth through 13 years of age among offspring of diabetic pregnancies (ODP) and offspring of non-diabetic pregnancies (ONDP) participating in the Exploring Perinatal Outcomes Among Children Study. SUBJECTS: There were 94 ODP and 399 ONDP who had multiple BMI measures obtained from birth throughout childhood. A measure of breast milk-months was derived from maternal self-report to categorize breast-feeding status as adequate (_6 breast milk-months) or low (< 6 breast milk-months). Mixed linear-effects models were constructed to assess the impact of breast-feeding on the BMI growth curves during infancy (birth to 27 months) and childhood (27 months to 13 years). RESULTS: ODP who were adequately breast-fed had a slower BMI growth trajectory during childhood (P=0.047) and slower period-specific growth velocity with significant differences between 4 and 6 years of age (P=0.03) and 6 to 9 years of age (P=0.01) compared with ODP with low breast-feeding. A similar pattern was seen in the ONDP, with adequate breast-feeding associated with lower average BMI in infancy (P=0.03) and childhood (P=0.0002) and a slower growth trajectory in childhood (P=0.0002). Slower period-specific growth velocity was seen among the ONDP associated with adequate breast-feeding with significant differences between 12-26 months (P=0.02), 4-6 years (P=0.03), 6-9 years (P=0.0001) and 9-13 years of age (P< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our study provides novel evidence that breast-feeding is associated with long-term effects on childhood BMI growth that extend beyond infancy into early and late childhood. Importantly, these effects are also present in the high-risk offspring, exposed to overnutrition during pregnancy. Breast-feeding in the early postnatal period may represent a critical opportunity to reduce the risk of childhood obesity.",,,3,,,
2510,"Motor vehicle injury prevention in eight American Indian/Alaska Native communities: results from the 2010-2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tribal Motor Vehicle Injury Prevention Program OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to increase seat belt (SB) use and reduce motor vehicle (MV) injuries and death; eight tribal communities implemented evidence-based strategies from the Guide to Community Preventive Services during 2010-2014. STUDY DESIGN: SB use was measured through direct observational surveys and traffic safety activity data. Traffic safety activities included enhanced enforcement campaign events, ongoing enforcement of SB laws, and media. The number of MV injuries (including fatal and non-fatal) was measured through MV crash data collected by police. RESULTS: Percentage change increases in SB use were observed in all eight projects; average annual increases of three projects were statistically significant (ranging from 10% to 43%). Four of the eight projects exceeded their goals for percentage change increases in SB use. Approximately 200 media events and 100 enforcement events focused on SB use were conducted across the eight projects. Five projects had an annual average of _100 SB use citations during the project period. MV injuries (fatal and non-fatal combined) significantly decreased in three projects (ranging from a 10% to 21% average annual decrease). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in SB use and decreases in the number of MV injuries can be achieved by tailoring evidence-based strategies to tribal communities.

2511,"Racial-ethnic disparities in stroke care: the American experience: a statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association PURPOSE: Our goal is to describe the effect of race and ethnicity on stroke epidemiology, personal beliefs, access to care, response to treatment, and participation in clinical research. In addition, we seek to determine the state of knowledge on the main factors that may explain disparities in stroke care, with the goal of identifying gaps in knowledge to guide future research. The intended audience includes physicians, nurses, other healthcare professionals, and policy makers. METHODS: Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and represent different areas of expertise in relation to racial-ethnic disparities in stroke care. The writing group reviewed the relevant literature, with an emphasis on reports published since 1972. The statement was approved by the writing group; the statement underwent peer review, then was approved by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. RESULTS: There are limitations in the definitions of racial and ethnic categories currently in use. For the purpose of this statement, we used the racial categories defined by the US federal government: white, black or African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander. There are 2 ethnic categories: people of Hispanic/Latino origin or not of Hispanic/Latino origin. There are differences in the distribution of the burden of risk factors, stroke incidence and prevalence, and stroke mortality among different racial and ethnic groups. In addition, there are disparities in stroke care between minority groups compared with whites. These disparities include lack of awareness of stroke symptoms and signs and lack of knowledge about the need for urgent treatment and the causal role of risk factors. There are also differences in attitudes, beliefs, and compliance among minorities compared with whites. Differences in socioeconomic status and insurance coverage, mistrust of the healthcare system, the relatively limited number of providers who are members of minority groups, and system limitations may contribute to disparities in access to or quality of care, which in turn might result in different rates of stroke morbidity and mortality. Cultural and language barriers probably also contribute to some of these disparities. Minorities use emergency medical services systems less, are often delayed in arriving at the emergency department, have longer waiting times in the emergency department, and are less likely to receive thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke. Although unmeasured factors may play a role in these delays, the presence of bias in the delivery of care cannot be excluded. Minorities have equal access to rehabilitation services, although they experience longer stays and have poorer functional status than whites. Minorities are inadequately treated with both primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies compared with whites. Sparse data exist on racial-ethnic disparities in access to surgical care after intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Participation of minorities in clinical research is limited. Barriers to participation in clinical research include beliefs, lack of trust, and limited awareness. Race is a contentious topic in biomedical research because race is not proven to be a surrogate for genetic constitution. CONCLUSIONS: There are limitations in the current definitions of race and ethnicity. Nevertheless, racial and ethnic disparities in stroke exist and include differences in the biological determinants of disease and disparities throughout the continuum of care, including access to and quality of care. Access to and participation in research is also limited among minority groups. Acknowledging the presence of disparities and understanding the factors that contribute to them are necessary first steps. More research is required to understand these differences and find solutions.",,,1,,,
2512,"Subordinate Effect of -21M HLA-B Dimorphism on NK Cell Repertoire Diversity and Function in HIV-1 Infected Individuals of African Origin Natural Killer (NK) cells play an important role in antiviral defense and their potent effector function identifies them as key candidates for immunotherapeutic interventions in chronic viral infections. Their remarkable functional agility is achieved by virtue of a wide array of germline-encoded inhibitory and activating receptors ensuring a self-tolerant and tunable repertoire. NK cell diversity is generated by a combination of factors including genetic determinants and infections/environmental factors, which together shape the NK cell pool and functional potential. Recently a genetic polymorphism at position -21 of HLA-B, which influences the supply of HLA-E binding peptides and availability of HLA-E for recognition by the inhibitory NK cell receptor NKG2A, was shown to have a marked influence on NK cell functionality in healthy human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) seronegative Caucasian individuals. In this study, -21 methionine (M)-expressing alleles supplying HLA-E binding peptides were largely poor ligands for inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), and a bias to NKG2A-mediated education of functionally-potent NK cells was observed. Here, we investigated the effect of this polymorphism on the phenotype and functional capacity of peripheral blood NK cells in a cohort of 36 African individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/HCMV co-infection. A similarly profound influence of dimorphism at position -21 of HLA-B on NK cells was not evident in these subjects. They predominantly expressed African specific HLA-B and -C alleles that contribute a distinct supply of NKG2A and KIR ligands, and these genetic differences were compounded by the marked effect of HIV-1/HCMV co-infection on NK cell differentiation. Together, these factors resulted in a lack of correlation of the HLA-B -21 polymorphism with surface abundance of HLA-E and loss of the NK cell functional advantage in subjects with -21M HLA-B alleles. Instead, our data suggest that during HIV/HCMV co-infection exposure of NK cells to an environment that displays altered HLA-E ligands drives adaptive NKG2C+ NK cell expansions influencing effector responses. Increased efforts to understand how NK cells are functionally calibrated to self-HLA during chronic viral infections will pave the way to developing targeted therapeutic interventions to overcome the current barriers to enhancing immune-based antiviral control.

2513,"Feasibility and Acceptability of a Clinic-based Mediterranean-style Diet Intervention to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk for Hispanic Americans With Type 2 Diabetes Purpose The purpose of the study was to modify a previously tested Spanish language version of a Mediterranean (Med)-style dietary intervention so that the dietary recommendations align with the cultural and social needs of Hispanic Americans (HAs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and evaluate the modified intervention's feasibility and acceptability. Methods In phase I (formative), semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used to refine the intervention content and format for delivery to HAs with T2D receiving care at a large primary care practice. In phase II (clinical pilot), the 2-month intervention that promoted a Med-style dietary pattern was given to all participants via 2 face-to-face counseling sessions and 2 telephone counseling sessions. Major outcomes were engagement with study activities and intervention acceptability; dietary behavior change at 2 months using the PREDIMED Med-diet score (range, 0-14, higher indicating better dietary pattern) is also reported. Results From clinic records, we identified 86 potentially eligible participants and enrolled 21. Baseline characteristics were: mean age = 52 years, 12 (57%) female, 15 (71%) from Mexico, mean years in the US = 19, low acculturation scores for all, and mean BMI = 33.7 kg/m2. Engagement and acceptability were high, with 19 (90%) completing all intervention visits and follow-up measures, all of whom would recommend the program to others. Mean Med-diet score improved from 5.7 to 7.9 (difference = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5; P = .001). Conclusions Intervention engagement and acceptability were high, and there was improvement in self-reported dietary behaviors. This type of intervention should be evaluated in randomized trials enrolling HAs with diabetes.",,,4,,,
2514,"Enrollment and service use patterns among persons with severe mental illness receiving expedited medicaid on release from state prisons, county jails, and psychiatric hospitals OBJECTIVE: This study examined postrelease patterns of Medicaid coverage and use of services among persons with severe mental illness who were referred for expedited Medicaid enrollment before their release from state prisons, county jails, and psychiatric hospitals in Washington State during 2006, the first year of a new policy authorizing this practice. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used with linked administrative data to identify persons with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) who were referred for expedited Medicaid enrollment from state prisons (N=252), county jails (N=489), and psychiatric hospitals (N=507). For each cohort, logistic regression was used to compare those who were approved for expedited Medicaid with those who were not approved; for the 30-, 60-, and 90-day periods after release, Medicaid enrollment status and use of outpatient mental health services were also compared. RESULTS: Approval rates were higher for persons released from psychiatric hospitals (91%) and state prisons (83%) than for those released from jails (66%) (p< .001). Across settings, approval was more likely for those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and for women (p< .001), as well as for whites and older offenders (p< .01). At the 90-day follow-up, those who were approved were more likely than those who were denied to be enrolled in Medicaid (p< .001) and to have used outpatient mental health services (p< .001). CONCLUSIONS: Expediting Medicaid benefits for persons with severe mental illness was associated with increased enrollment and outpatient mental health service use in the 90 days after release from state prisons, county jails, and psychiatric hospitals in Washington State.",,,1,,,
2515,"Fidelity to recovery-oriented ACT practices and consumer outcomes OBJECTIVE: A previous study of a recovery-oriented assertive community treatment initiative (PACT) in Washington State found reductions in state psychiatric hospital use and related costs for PACT participants, especially in the first six months after enrollment and for consumers who were high users of the state psychiatric hospital before ACT enrollment. This study examined whether these outcomes varied by team fidelity to recovery-oriented ACT practices. METHODS: Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the relationship between scores on the Tool for Measurement of Assertive Community Treatment (TMACT), a recently developed tool for assessing fidelity to recovery-oriented ACT, and the use of state hospitals, local hospitals, emergency departments, local crisis stabilization units, and arrests for 631 PACT consumers. These relationships were also examined for PACT consumers with any state hospital use (N=450) and those considered high users of the state hospital (_ 96 days in two years before PACT enrollment). RESULTS: TMACT scores were associated (p< .01) with a decrease in the amount of use but not the probability of using state psychiatric hospitals, local hospital psychiatric inpatient units, and local crisis stabilization units. The marginal effects of higher TMACT scores on the probability and use of emergency departments or arrests were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence for the predictive validity of the TMACT. Future research should examine the subscale structure of the TMACT as well as the association between TMACT fidelity and consumer well-being, quality of life, and other important person-centered outcomes.",,,1,,,
2516,"Microenterprise development interventions for sexual risk reduction: a systematic review Comprehensive interventions that address both individual and structural determinants associated with HIV/STI risk are gaining increasing attention over the past decade. Microenterprise development offers an appealing model for HIV prevention by addressing poverty and gender equality. This study systematically reviewed the effects of microenterprise development interventions on HIV/STI incidence and sexual risk behaviors. Microenterprise development was defined as developing small business capacity among individuals to alleviate poverty. Seven eligible research studies representing five interventions were identified and included in this review. All of the studies targeted women, and three focused on sex workers. None measured biomarker outcomes. All three sex worker studies showed significant reduction in sexual risk behaviors when compared to the control group. Non-sex worker studies showed limited changes in sexual risk behavior. This review indicates the potential utility of microenterprise development in HIV risk reduction programs. More research is needed to determine how microenterprise development can be effectively incorporated in comprehensive HIV control strategies.",,,6,,,
2517,"Changes in Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors with Unintentional Versus Intentional Weight Loss: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study BACKGROUND: It is well known that total and intentional weight loss (IWL) are associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, however, associations with unintentional weight loss (UWL) have not been studied. METHODS: We examined annual changes in blood pressure and lipids associated with UWL versus IWL in 576 participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who had lost weight over one of two time intervals (i.e., study years 5-7 or 7-10) and reported whether the weight loss was intentional at the end of the interval. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, race, and field center, an annual weight loss smaller than 6% resulted in small improvements in lipids that were similar regardless of intentionality. When annual weight loss was _6%, UWL was associated with less reduction in total cholesterol (-0.2 vs. -10.4__g/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-3.2 vs. -9.4__g/dL), and triglycerides (-0.5 vs. -19.0__g/dL) compared with IWL. Intentionality was not associated with the size of changes in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: -2.7 vs. -2.0__mHg; diastolic blood pressure: -2.2 vs. -1.3__mHg) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.2 vs. 2.7__g/dL). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial UWL may be accompanied or preceded by other biological changes in this young adult population that alter changes in CVD risk factors that are associated with IWL.",,,3,,,
2518,"Recruitment and retention in obesity prevention and treatment trials targeting minority or low-income children: a review of the clinical trials registration database BACKGROUND: Efforts to recruit and retain participants in clinical trials are challenging, especially in studies that include minority or low-income children. To date, no studies have systematically examined recruitment and retention strategies and their effectiveness in working successfully with this population. We examined strategies employed to recruit or retain minority or low-income children in trials that included an obesity-related behavior modification component. METHODS: First, completed home-, community-, and school-based trials involving minority or low-income children aged 2-17 years were identified in a search of the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. Second, a PubMed search of identified trials was conducted to locate publications pertinent to identified trials. Recruitment and retention rates were calculated for studies that included relevant information. RESULTS: Our final analytic sample included 43 studies. Of these, 25 studies reported recruitment or retention strategies, with the amount of information varying from a single comment to several pages; 4 published no specific information on recruitment or retention; and 14 had no publications listed in PubMed. The vast majority (92 %) of the 25 studies reported retention rates of, on average, 86 %. Retention rates were lower in studies that: targeted solely Hispanics or African Americans (vs. mixed races of African Americans, whites, and others); involved children and parents (vs. children only); focused on overweight or obese children (vs. general children), lasted _1 year (vs. < 1 year), were home or community-based (vs. school-based), included nutrition and physical activity intervention (vs. either intervention alone), had body mass index or other anthropometrics as primary outcome measures (vs. obesity-related behavior, insulin sensitivity, etc.). Retention rates did not vary based on child age, number of intervention sessions, or sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Variable amounts of information were provided on recruitment and retention strategies in obesity-related trials involving minority or low-income children. Although reported retention rates were fairly high, a lack of reporting limited the available information. More and consistent reporting and systematic cataloging of recruitment and retention methods are needed. In addition, qualitative and quantitative studies to inform evidence-based decisions in the selection of effective recruitment and retention strategies for trials including minority or low-income children are warranted.",,,6,,,
2519,"Prediction of Body Mass Index Using Concurrently Self-Reported or Previously Measured Height and Weight OBJECTIVE: To compare alternative models for the imputation of BMIM (measured weight in kilograms/measured height in meters squared) in a longitudinal study. METHODS: We used data from 11,008 adults examined at wave III (2001-2002) and wave IV (2007-2008) in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Participants were asked their height and weight before being measured. Equations to predict wave IV BMIM were developed in an 80% random subsample and evaluated in the remaining participants. The validity of models that included BMI constructed from previously measured height and weight (BMIPM) was compared to the validity of models that used BMI calculated from concurrently self-reported height and weight (BMISR). The usefulness of including demographics and perceived weight category in those models was also examined. RESULTS: The model that used BMISR, compared to BMIPM, as the only variable produced a larger R2 (0.913 vs. 0.693), a smaller root mean square error (2.07 vs. 3.90 kg/m2) and a lower bias between normal-weight participants and those with obesity (0.98 vs. 4.24 kg/m2). The performance of the model containing BMISR alone was not substantially improved by the addition of demographics, perceived weight category or BMIPM. CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first to show that concurrent self-reports of height and weight may be more useful than previously measured height and weight for imputation of missing BMIM when the time interval between measures is relatively long. Other time frames and alternatives to in-person collection of self-reported data need to be examined.",,,3,,,
2520,"Evaluation of anthropometric equations to assess body fat in adults: NHANES 1999-2004 PURPOSE: Equations that estimate percentage body fat (PBF) from anthropometrics are widely used, although most were developed in small nonrepresentative samples. No study has examined the generalizability of these equations in a nationally representative population. This study evaluated the validity of 26 sets (2 for males and 3 for females only) of published equations for PBF estimation in American adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. METHODS: Data were from 9934 adults ages _20 yr. Stratified by sex, equations were evaluated against dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry using R, root mean square error, and mean signed difference. Differential bias was evaluated by the absolute value of the discrepancy between the mean signed difference values in normal weight and obese adults. RESULTS: In subgroups matched to the range of age and race/ethnicity in which equations were derived, most equations had R values between 0.5 and 0.7 and root mean square error estimates between 3.0 and 4.0 percentage points for males and between 3.5 and 4.5 percentage points for females. Analyses in sample stratified by age, obesity status, or race/ethnicity showed that 15 of the 23 equations for males and 20 of the 24 equations for females had important differential bias of more than two percentage points. Equations that included WC performed the best in males, and those that included body mass index performed best in females. Equations using skinfold thickness performed less well in older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Published PBF equations had moderately strong R values in a representative sample of American men and women, but both nondifferential and differential biases were substantial for most equations.",,,9,,,
2521,"Recruitment strategies for predominantly low-income, multi-racial/ethnic children and parents to 3-year community-based intervention trials: Childhood Obesity Prevention and Treatment Research (COPTR) Consortium BACKGROUND: The recruitment of participants into community-based randomized controlled trials studying childhood obesity is often challenging, especially from low-income racial/ethnical minorities and when long-term participant commitments are required. This paper describes strategies used to recruit and enroll predominately low-income racial/ethnic minority parents and children into the Childhood Obesity Prevention and Treatment Research (COPTR) consortium. METHODS: The COPTR consortium has run four independent 3-year, multi-level (individual, family, school, clinic, and community) community-based randomized controlled trials. Two were prevention trials in preschool children and the other two were treatment trials in pre-adolescents and adolescent youth. All trials reported monthly participant recruitment numbers using a standardized method over the projected 18-24__onths of recruitment. After randomization of participants was completed, recruitment staff and investigators from each trial retrospectively completed a survey of recruitment strategies and their perceived top three recruitment strategies and barriers. RESULTS: Recruitment was completed in 15-21__onths across trials, enrolling a total of 1745 parent-child dyads- out of 6314 screened. The number of children screened per randomized child was 4.6 and 3.5 in the two prevention trials, and 3.1 and 2.5 in the two treatment trials. Recruitment strategies reported included: (1) careful planning, (2) working with trusting community partners, (3) hiring recruitment staff who were culturally sensitive, personality appropriate, and willing to work flexible hours, (4) contacting potential participants actively and repeatedly, (5) recruiting at times and locations convenient for participants, (6) providing incentives to participants to complete baseline measures, (7) using a tracking database, (8) evaluating whether participants understand the activities and expectations of the study, and (9) assessing participants' motivation for participating. Working with community partners, hiring culturally sensitive staff, and contacting potential participants repeatedly were cited by two trials among their top three strategies. The requirement of a 3-year commitment to the trial was cited by two trials to be among the top three recruitment barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive strategies that include community partnership support, culturally sensitive recruitment staff, and repeated contacts with potential participants can result in successful recruitment of low-income racial/ethnic minority families into obesity prevention and treatment trials.

2522,"Race-Specific Patterns of Treatment Intensification Among Hypertensive Patients Using Home Blood Pressure Monitoring: Analysis Using Defined Daily Doses in the Heart Healthy Lenoir Study BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in blood pressure (BP) control persist, but whether differences by race in antihypertensive medication intensification (AMI) contribute is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare AMI by race for patients with elevated home BP readings. METHODS: This prospective cohort study followed adult patients from 6 rural primary care practices who used home BP monitoring (HBPM) and recorded/reported values. For providers, AMI was encouraged when mean HBPM systolic blood pressure (SBP) values were _135 mm Hg; patients received phone-based coaching on HBPM technique and sharing HBPM findings. AMI was assessed between baseline and 12 months using defined daily dose (DDD) and summed to create a total antihypertensive DDD value. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients (mean age = 61.4 _ 10.2 years; 66% female; 57% black) provided usable HBPM data. Among 90 (41%) intensification-eligible hypertensive patients (ie, mean HBPM SBP values for 6-months _135 mm Hg), mean total antihypertensive DDD was increased in 61% at 12 months. Blacks had significantly higher mean DDD at baseline and 12 months, but intensification (+0.72 vs +0.65; P = 0.83) was similar by race. However, intensification was greater in males than females (+1.1 vs +0.39; P = 0.031). Reduction in mean SBP following intensification was greater in white versus black patients (-8.2 vs -3.9 mm Hg; P = 0.14). Conclusion/Relevance: Treatment intensification in HBPM users was similar by race, differed significantly by gender, and may produce a greater response in white patients. Differential AMI in HBPM users does not appear to contribute to persistent racial disparities in BP control.",,,5,,,
2523,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms at five loci are associated with C-reactive protein levels in a cohort of Filipino young adults C-reactive protein (CRP) is a component of nonspecific immune defense and is a reliable marker of low-grade inflammation involved in obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Genome-wide association studies in middle-aged and elderly populations, predominantly of European descent, demonstrated associations of CRP levels with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at several loci. To examine whether the variants identified are replicated in Filipino young adults, we applied Tobit regression models to study the association of plasma CRP with 12 SNPs at seven loci in a cohort of 1691 Filipino young adults (aged 21.5_0.3 years) from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. SNPs in or near CRP (P=3.2 _ 10(-11)), HNF1A, IL6R, APOE-APOC1 and LEPR showed significant associations (P< 0.05) and together explained 4.8% of the total variation in CRP. Modest interactions were observed between LEPR-rs1892534 and waist circumference (uncorrected P(interaction)=0.020) and between APOE-rs769449 and pathogen exposure (uncorrected P(interaction)=0.0073) in models predicting CRP.

2525,"Associations between arsenic species in exfoliated urothelial cells and prevalence of diabetes among residents of Chihuahua, Mexico BACKGROUND: A growing number of studies link chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) with the risk of diabetes. Many of these studies assessed iAs exposure by measuring arsenic (As) species in urine. However, this approach has been criticized because of uncertainties associated with renal function and urine dilution in diabetic individuals. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to examine associations between the prevalence of diabetes and concentrations of As species in exfoliated urothelial cells (EUC) as an alternative to the measures of As in urine. METHODS: We measured concentrations of trivalent and pentavalent iAs methyl-As (MAs) and dimethyl-As (DMAs) species in EUC from 374 residents of Chihuahua, Mexico, who were exposed to iAs in drinking water. We used fasting plasma glucose, glucose tolerance tests, and self-reported diabetes diagnoses or medication to identify diabetic participants. Associations between As species in EUC and diabetes were estimated using logistic and linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. RESULTS: Interquartile-range increases in trivalent, but not pentavalent, As species in EUC were positively and significantly associated with diabetes, with ORs of 1.57 (95% CI: 1.19, 2.07) for iAsIII, 1.63 (1.24, 2.15) for MAsIII, and 1.31 (0.96, 1.84) for DMAsIII. DMAs/MAs and DMAs/iAs ratios were negatively associated with diabetes (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.83 and OR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.96, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that uncertainties associated with measures of As species in urine may be avoided by using As species in EUC as markers of iAs exposure and metabolism. Our results provide additional support to previous findings suggesting that trivalent As species may be responsible for associations between diabetes and chronic iAs exposure.",,,4,,,
2526,"Adaptation of the World Health Organization's medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use for use in the United States BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently adapted global guidance on contraceptive use from the World Health Organization (WHO) to create the United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (MEC). This guidance includes recommendations for use of specific contraceptive methods by people with certain characteristics or medical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: CDC determined the need and scope for the adaptation, conducted 12 systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and convened a meeting of health professionals to discuss recommendations based on the evidence. RESULTS: The vast majority of the US guidance is the same as the WHO guidance and addresses over 160 characteristics or medical conditions. Modifications were made to WHO recommendations for six medical conditions, and recommendations were developed for six new medical conditions. CONCLUSION: The US MEC is intended to serve as a source of clinical guidance for providers as they counsel clients about contraceptive method choices. Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,5,,,

METHODS: We used Poisson models to examine the association of area-level indicators of educational attainment, poverty, living situation, and density of primary care physicians with incident HF diagnosed in the inpatient (IP) and OP settings among a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries (n_= 109,756; 2001-2013). RESULTS: The age-standardized rate of HF incidence was 35.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.1-36.5) and 13.9 (95% CI, 13.5-14.4) cases per 1000 person-years in IP and OP settings, respectively. The incidence rate differences (IRDs) per 1000 person-years in both settings suggested greater incidence of HF in high- compared to low-poverty areas (IP IRD_= 4.47 [95% CI, 3.29-5.65], OP IRD_= 1.41 [95% CI, 0.61-2.22]) and_in low- compared to high-education areas (IP IRD_= 3.73 [95% CI, 2.63-4.82], OP IRD_= 1.72 [95% CI, 0.97-2.47]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the role of area-level social determinants of health in the incidence of HF in both the IP and OP settings. These findings may have implications for HF prevention policies. Copyright _ 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,9,,,
2528,"A population approach using cholesterol imputation to identify adults with high cardiovascular risk: a report from AHRQ's EvidenceNow initiative Objective: Large practice networks have access to EHR data that can be used to drive important improvements in population health. However, missing data often limit improvement efforts. Our goal was to determine the proportion of patients in a cohort of small primary care practices who lacked cholesterol data to calculate ASCVD risk scores and then gauge the extent that imputation can accurately identify individuals already at high risk. 219 practices enrolled. Patients between the ages of 40 and 79 years qualified for risk calculation. For patients who lacked cholesterol data, we measured the effect of employing a conservative estimation strategy using a total cholesterol of 170 mg/dl and HDL-cholesterol of 50 mg/dl in the ASCVD risk equation to identify patients with _ 10%, 10-year ASCVD risk who were eligible for risk reduction interventions then compared this to a rigorous formal imputation methodology. 345 440 patients, average age 58 years, qualified for risk scores. 108 515 patients were missing cholesterol information. Using the ""good value"" estimation methodology, 40 565 had risk scores _ 10% compared to 43 205 using formal imputation. However, the latter strategy yielded a lower specificity and higher false positive rate. Estimates using either strategy achieved ASCVD risk stratification quickly and accurately identified high risk patients who could benefit from intervention.",,,1,,,
2529,"Factors associated with decisions to undergo surgery among patients with newly diagnosed early-stage lung cancer CONTEXT: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Surgical resection for stage I or II non-small cell cancer remains the only reliable treatment for cure. Patients who do not undergo surgery have a median survival of less than 1 year. Despite the survival disadvantage, many patients with early-stage disease do not receive surgical care and rates are even lower for black patients. OBJECTIVES: To identify potentially modifiable factors regarding surgery in patients newly diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer and to explore why blacks undergo surgery less often than whites. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective cohort study with patients identified by pulmonary, oncology, thoracic surgery, and generalist practices in 5 communities through study referral or computerized tomography review protocol. A total of 437 patients with biopsy-proven or probable early-stage lung cancer were enrolled between December 2005 and December 2008. Before establishment of treatment plans, patients were administered a survey including questions about trust, patient-physician communication, attitudes toward cancer, and functional status. Information about comorbid illnesses was obtained through chart audits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Lung cancer surgery within 4 months of diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 386 patients met full eligibility criteria for lung resection surgery. The median age was 66 years (range, 26-90 years) and 29% of patients were black. The surgical rate was 66% for white patients (n = 179/273) compared with 55% for black patients (n = 62/113; P = .05). Negative perceptions of patient-physician communication manifested by a 5-point decrement on a 25-point communication scale (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.74) and negative perception of 1-year prognosis postsurgery (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.50; absolute risk, 34%) were associated with decisions against surgery. Surgical rates for blacks were particularly low when they had 2 or more comorbid illnesses (13% vs 62% for < 2 comorbidities; OR, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.25]; absolute risk, 49%) and when blacks lacked a regular source of care (42% with no regular care vs 57% with regular care; OR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.10-0.43]; absolute risk, 15%). CONCLUSIONS: A decision not to undergo surgery by patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer was independently associated with perceptions of communication and prognosis, older age, multiple comorbidities, and black race. Interventions to optimize surgery should consider these factors.",,,3,,,
2530,"A Multi-faceted Intervention Aimed at Black-White Disparities in the Treatment of Early Stage Cancers: The ACCURE Pragmatic Quality Improvement trial BACKGROUND: Reports continue to show that Blacks with curable lung or breast cancer complete treatment less often than similar Whites contributing to worse survival. ACCURE is an intervention trial designed to address this problem. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A pragmatic, quality improvement trial comparing an intervention group to retrospective and concurrent controls. Patients with early stage breast or lung cancer aged 18 to 85 were enrolled (N_=_302) at 2 cancer centers between April 2013 and March 2015 for the intervention component. Data from patients seen between January 2007 and December 2012 with these diagnoses were obtained to establish control completion rates. Concurrent data for non-study patients were used to identify secular trends. The intervention included: a real time registry derived from electronic health records of participants to signal missed appointments or unmet care milestones, a navigator, and clinical feedback. The primary outcome was ""Treatment Complete"", a composite variable representing completion of surgery, recommended radiation and chemotherapy for each patient. RESULTS: The mean age in the intervention group was 63.1 years; 37.1% of patients were Black. Treatment completion in retrospective and concurrent controls showed significant Black-White differences (Blacks (B) 79.8% vs. Whites (W) 87.3%, p_< _0.001; 83.1% B vs. 90.1% W, p_< _0.001, respectively). The disparity lessened within the intervention (B 88.4% and W 89.5%, p_=_0.77). Multivariate analyses confirmed disparities reduction. OR for Black-White disparity within the intervention was 0.98 (95% CI 0.46-2.1); Black completion in the intervention compared favorably to Whites in retrospective (OR 1.6; 95% CI 0.90-2.9) and concurrent (OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.59-2.0) controls. CONCLUSION: A real time registry combined with feedback and navigation improved completion of treatment for all breast and lung cancer patients and narrowed disparities. Similar multi-faceted interventions could mitigate disparities in the treatment of other cancers and chronic conditions. Copyright _ 2019 National Medical Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

2531,"A system-based intervention to reduce Black-White disparities in the treatment of early stage lung cancer: A pragmatic trial at five cancer centers BACKGROUND: Advances in early diagnosis and curative treatment have reduced high mortality rates associated with non-small cell lung cancer. However, racial disparity in survival persists partly because Black patients receive less curative treatment than White patients. METHODS: We performed a 5-year pragmatic, trial at five cancer centers using a system-based intervention. Patients diagnosed with early stage lung cancer, aged 18-85 were eligible. Intervention components included: (1) a real-time warning system derived from electronic health records, (2) race-specific feedback to clinical teams on treatment completion rates, and (3) a nurse navigator. Consented patients were compared to retrospective and concurrent controls. The primary outcome was receipt of curative treatment. RESULTS: There were 2841 early stage lung cancer patients (16% Black) in the retrospective group and 360 (32% Black) in the intervention group. For the retrospective baseline, crude treatment rates were 78% for White patients vs 69% for Black patients (P_< _0.001); difference by race was confirmed by a model adjusted for age, treatment site, cancer stage, gender, comorbid illness, and income-odds ratio (OR) 0.66 for Black patients (95% CI 0.51-0.85, P_=_0.001). Within the intervention cohort, the crude rate was 96.5% for Black vs 95% for White patients (P_=_0.56). Odds ratio for the adjusted analysis was 2.1 (95% CI 0.41-10.4, P_=_0.39) for Black vs White patients. Between group analyses confirmed treatment parity for the intervention. CONCLUSION: A system-based intervention tested in five cancer centers reduced racial gaps and improved care for all. _ 2019 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,3,,,
2532,"Weighing projections of physical decline in lung cancer surgery decisions BACKGROUND: Patients with early-stage lung cancer often have comorbid illnesses and fear debility and death when contemplating surgery. However, data that compare physical function of patients who receive surgery with similar patients who do not are sparse. The authors report 1-year outcome results for surgical and nonsurgical patients in a prospective lung cancer cohort to address this gap. METHODS: The authors enrolled 386 patients with early-stage lung cancer. A 106-item survey was completed at the time of enrollment including the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) Health Survey to assess functional status. Patients were followed for a year. Chart abstractions were obtained to determine comorbid illnesses and surgical status. Death was ascertained through vital records. The SF-12 was repeated 1 year after the enrollment. Regression models were constructed to identify predictors of 1-year mortality and decline in physical function. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (15.3%) died before 1-year follow-up. Mortality in the surgical group was 10.8% compared with 22.8% in the nonsurgical group (P < 0.001). In regression analysis controlling for age and comorbidities, surgical treatment was associated with a reduction in 1-year mortality (odds ratio: 0.5 and 95% confidence interval: 0.3-1.0) but did not worsen physical function relative to the untreated group (average decrease in physical component score of SF-12 = 1.9 for surgery group and 2.5 for no surgery group, P = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Functional decline between surgically treated and untreated patients did not differ. This result casts doubt on its value as a treatment determinant. Cancer mortality seems to be a more essential issue in treatment decisions.",,,5,,,
2533,"Identification of new genetic polymorphisms that alter the dietary requirement for choline and vary in their distribution across ethnic and racial groups Effect alleles (alleles with a polymorphism that is associated with the effect being measured) in a small number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to influence the dietary requirement for choline. In this study, we examined a much larger number of SNPs (n=200) in 10 genes related to choline metabolism for associations with development of organ dysfunction (liver or muscle) when 79 humans were fed a low-choline diet. We confirmed that effect alleles in SNPs such as the C allele of PEMT rs12325817 increase the risk of developing organ dysfunction in women when they consume a diet low in choline, and we identified novel effect alleles, such as the C allele of CHKA SNP rs7928739, that alter dietary choline requirements. When fed a low-choline diet, some people presented with muscle damage rather than liver damage; several effect alleles in SLC44A1 (rs7873937, G allele; rs2771040, G; rs6479313, G; rs16924529, A; and rs3199966, C) and one in CHKB (rs1557502, A) were more common in these individuals. This suggests that pathways related to choline metabolism are more important for normal muscle function than previously thought. In European, Mexican, and Asian Americans, and in individuals of African descent, we examined the prevalence of the effect alleles in SNPs that alter choline requirement and found that they are differentially distributed among people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds. Overall, our study has identified novel genetic variants that modulate choline requirements and suggests that the dietary requirement for choline may be different across racial and ethnic groups.-Da Costa, K.-A., Corbin, K.

2534,"Dietary docosahexaenoic acid supplementation modulates hippocampal development in the Pemt-/- mouse The development of fetal brain is influenced by nutrients such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) and choline. Phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine enriched in DHA and many humans have functional genetic polymorphisms in the PEMT gene. Previously, it was reported that Pemt(-/-) mice have altered hippocampal development. The present study explores whether abnormal phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis causes altered incorporation of DHA into membranes, thereby influencing brain development, and determines whether supplemental dietary DHA can reverse some of these changes. Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and Pemt(-/-) mice were fed a control diet, or a diet supplemented with 3 g/kg of DHA, from gestational day 11 to 17. Brains from embryonic day 17 fetuses derived from Pemt(-/-) dams fed the control diet had 25-50% less phospholipid-DHA as compared with WT (p < 0.05). Also, they had 60% more neural progenitor cell proliferation (p < 0.05), 60% more neuronal apoptosis (p < 0.01), and 30% less calretinin expression (p < 0.05; a marker of neuronal differentiation) in the hippocampus compared with WT. The DHA-supplemented diet increased fetal brain Pemt(-/-) phospholipid-DHA to WT levels, and abrogated the neural progenitor cell proliferation and apoptosis differences. Although this diet did not change proliferation in the WT group, it halved the rate of apoptosis (p < 0.05). In both genotypes, the DHA-supplemented diet increased calretinin expression 2-fold (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the changes in hippocampal development in the Pemt(-/-) mouse could be mediated by altered DHA incorporation into membrane phospholipids, and that maternal dietary DHA can influence fetal brain development.",,,4,,,
2535,"Docosahexaenoic acid in plasma phosphatidylcholine may be a potential marker for in vivo phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity in humans BACKGROUND: Choline is an essential nutrient for humans, and part of this requirement is met by endogenous synthesis catalyzed by hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). PEMT activity is difficult to estimate in humans because it requires a liver biopsy. Previously, we showed that mice that lack functional PEMT have dramatically reduced concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) in plasma and of liver phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)-a phospholipid formed by PEMT. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate plasma PtdCho-DHA concentrations as a noninvasive marker of liver PEMT activity in humans. DESIGN: Plasma PtdCho-DHA concentrations were measured in 72 humans before and after they consumed a low-choline diet, and correlations were analyzed in relation to estrogen status, PEMT polymorphism rs12325817, the ratio of plasma S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), and dietary choline intake; all of these factors are associated with changes in liver PEMT activity. PtdCho-DHA and PEMT activity were also measured in human liver specimens. RESULTS: At baseline, the portion of PtdCho species containing DHA (pmol PtdCho-DHA/nmol PtdCho) was higher in premenopausal women than in men and postmenopausal women (P < 0.01). This ratio was lower in premenopausal women with the rs12325817 polymorphism in the PEMT gene (P < 0.05), and PtdCho-DHA concentration and PEMT activity were lower in human liver samples from women who were homozygous for PEMT rs12325817 (P < 0.05). The ratio of DHA-PtdCho to PtdCho in plasma was directly correlated with the ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy (P = 0.0001). The portion of PtdCho species containing DHA in plasma was altered in subjects who consumed a low-choline diet. CONCLUSION: PtdCho-DHA may be useful as a surrogate marker for in vivo hepatic PEMT activity in humans. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00065546.",,,4,,,
2536,"Correlates of accelerometer-assessed physical activity in pregnancy-The 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study Objective methods to measure physical activity (PA) have become available and widely used given the high degree of precision to evaluate PA. However, few studies have used accelerometers to measure PA during pregnancy, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We assessed overall PA, moderate, vigorous, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) objectively measured among pregnant women and their correlates in a population-based study. PA was assessed for seven consecutive days using a raw triaxial wrist-worn accelerometer in women interviewed around 16 and 24_weeks of gestation in the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. The average acceleration, which expresses overall PA, was presented in milli-g (1_mg_=_0.001_g), and average time (min/day) spent in MVPA (>100_mg) was also analyzed in 5- and 10-min bouts. Analyses were performed using linear regression. In total, 2317 women were included in the analyses. Overall PA was 27.6_mg. Pregnant women spent on average 14_min/day in MVPA and 0.4_min in vigorous PA. Time spent in MVPA and total PA were inversely associated with years in school and income, and were lower among women receiving advice to not exercise. MVPA was also inversely associated with age, lower among women living with a partner, and higher among non-white women. The study indicated low levels of PA among pregnant women. The identified correlates may provide a framework to better understand factors influencing PA during pregnancy and thus inform future interventions. _ 2018 The Authors.

2537,"Enriching Patient-Centered Medical Homes Through Peer Support Peer supporters are recognized by various designations-community health workers, promotores de salud, lay health advisers-and are community members who work for pay or as volunteers in association with health care systems or nonprofit community organizations and often share ethnicity, language, and socioeconomic status with the mentees that they serve. Although emerging evidence demonstrates the efficacy of peer support at the community level, the adoption and implementation of this resource into patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) is still under development. To accelerate that integration, this article addresses three major elements of peer support interventions: the functions and features of peer support, a framework and programmatic strategies for implementation, and fiscal models that would support the sustained viability of peer support programs within PCMHs. Key functions of peer support include assistance in daily management of health-related behaviors, social and emotional support, linkage to clinical care, and longitudinal or ongoing support. An organizational model of innovation implementation provides a useful framework for determining how to implement and evaluate peer support programs in PCMHs. Programmatic strategies that can be useful in developing peer support programs within PCMHs include peer coaching or mentoring, group self-management training, and programs designed around the telephone and information technology. Fiscal models for peer support programs include linkages with hospital or health care systems, service- or community-based nonprofit organizations, and partnerships between health care systems and community groups. Peer support promises to enrich PCMHs by activating patients in their self-care, providing culturally sensitive outreach, and opening the way for partnerships with community-based organizations. _ 2015 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.",,,2,,,
2538,"A method to determine the impact of patient-centered care interventions in primary care OBJECTIVE: The implementation of patient-centered care (PCC) innovations continues to be poorly understood. We used the implementation effectiveness framework to pilot a method for measuring the impact of a PCC innovation in primary care practices. METHODS: We analyzed data from a prior study that assessed the implementation of an electronic geriatric quality-of-life (QOL) module in 3 primary care practices in central North Carolina in 2011-2012. Patients responded to the items and the subsequent patient-provider encounter was coded using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) system. We developed an implementation effectiveness measure specific to the QOL module (i.e., frequency of usage during the encounter) using RIAS and then tested if there were differences with RIAS codes using analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 60 patient-provider encounters examined differences in the uptake of the QOL module (i.e., implementation-effectiveness measure) with the frequency of RIAS codes during the encounter (i.e., patient-centeredness measure). There was a significant association between the effectiveness measure and patient-centered RIAS codes. CONCLUSION: The concept of implementation effectiveness provided a useful framework determine the impact of a PCC innovation. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A method that captures real-time interactions between patients and care staff over time can meaningfully evaluate PCC innovations. Copyright _ 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2540,"Development, validation and use of an insulin sensitivity score in youths with diabetes: the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The ability to measure insulin sensitivity across the phenotypic spectrum of diabetes may contribute to a more accurate characterisation of diabetes type. Our goal was to develop and validate an insulin sensitivity (IS) score using the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp in a subset (n_=_85) of 12- to 19-year-old youths with diabetes participating in the SEARCH study in Colorado, USA. METHODS: Youths with a diagnosis of type 1 (n_=_60) or type 2 diabetes (n_=_25) underwent a 3 h clamp to measure glucose disposal rate (GDR, mg kg__ min__). Demographic (age, sex, race), clinical (BMI, waist, Tanner stage) and metabolic characteristics (HbA_(c), lipids, blood pressure, urine albumin:creatinine) were used to estimate log(e)IS score via stepwise linear regression on a model-development set (n_=_53). Estimated IS score was evaluated for reproducibility on two validation sets: youths with diabetes (n_=_33) and healthy control youths (n_=_22). RESULTS: The best model included waist, triacylglycerol (TG) and HbA_(c) levels (R__=_0.74). Diabetes type did not enter the model and there were no significant interactions between diabetes type and other predictors. Estimated IS score correlated well (r_=_0.65, p_< _0.0001; r_=_0.62, p_=_0.002) with GDR on the two validation sets. Based on this analysis, we propose the following formula to estimate insulin sensitivity in youths with diabetes: [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin sensitivity can be estimated in adolescents with diabetes using routinely collected measures. This score can be applied to epidemiological studies of youths with diabetes to characterise relationships between dimensions of diabetes type.",,,4,,,
2541,"Association testing of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes in multi-ethnic youth AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Common variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. However, it is not known whether TCF7L2 variation increases the risk of early onset type 2 diabetes. Using a case-control design, we examined whether the reported variants [rs12255372 (T/G) and rs7903146 (T/C)] are associated with type 2 diabetes in SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study participants. METHODS: Variants were genotyped in 694 non-Hispanic white (NHW) youth (86 cases, mean age 15.5_years, mean BMI 34.8; and 608 controls, mean age 14.4_years, mean BMI 22.3) and 545 African-American (AA) youth (154 cases, mean age 15.9, mean BMI 37; and 391 controls, mean age 14.8, mean BMI 23.8). Logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI and West African ancestry. RESULTS: The association of the risk T allele with case/control status was different in AA and NHW youth (p_=_0.025). Among AA youth, each copy of the T allele (rs7903146) was associated with a 1.97-fold (1.37, 2.82) increased odds for type 2 diabetes (p_< _0.0001), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and African ancestry. No significant association was detected in NHW youth (adjusted OR, 1.14; 0.73, 1.79). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: TCF7L2 variation is associated with an increased risk of early-onset type 2 diabetes among AA youth, and the association appears to be stronger in AA than NHW youth. This suggests potential different contributions of genetic and environmental factors to early-onset type 2 diabetes by race.",,,4,,,

2544,"Clinical evolution of beta cell function in youth with diabetes: the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Few studies have explored the epidemiology of beta cell loss in youth with diabetes. This report describes the evolution and major determinants of beta cell function, assessed by fasting C-peptide (FCP), in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study. METHODS: Participants were 1,277 youth with diabetes (948 positive for diabetes autoantibodies [DAs] and 329 negative for DAs), diagnosed when aged < 20_years, who were followed from a median of 8_months post diagnosis, for approximately 30_months. We modelled the relationship between rate of change in log FCP and determinants of interest using repeated measures general linear models. RESULTS: Among DA-positive youth, there was a progressive decline in beta cell function of 4% per month, independent of demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity (HLA risk), HbA(1c) and BMI z score, or presence of insulin resistance. Among DA-negative youth, there was marked heterogeneity in beta cell loss, reflecting an aetiologically mixed group. This group likely includes youths with undetected autoimmunity (whose decline is similar to that of DA-positive youth) and youth with non-autoimmune, insulin-resistant diabetes, with limited decline (~0.7% per month). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: SEARCH provides unique estimates of beta cell function decline in a large sample of youth with diabetes, indicating that autoimmunity is the major contributor. These data contribute to a better understanding of clinical evolution of beta cell function in youth with diabetes, provide strong support for the aetiological classification of diabetes type and may inform tertiary prevention efforts targeted at high-risk groups.",,,4,,,
2545,"The value of national diabetes registries: SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common severe chronic diseases of childhood. Much of our knowledge of the epidemiology of diabetes in young people has been generated by large collaborative efforts based on standardized registry data, such as the DIAMOND Project worldwide and the EURODIAB study in Europe. These registries showed that although at the start of the 20th century childhood diabetes was rare, by the end of the century a steady increase in incidence had been reported in many parts of the world. However, epidemiologic data for temporal trends in pediatric diabetes are still lacking or are minimal for most of the global population of youth, including in the United States. In addition, the epidemiology of diabetes in youth is changing. As youth are becoming increasingly overweight, we are seeing more obese children with a clinical phenotype of type 2 diabetes or ""adult-onset"" diabetes. It is imperative that efforts directed at surveillance of diabetes in young people continue and expand, not only to understand its complex etiology, but also because of its increasing public health importance.",,,4,,,

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence (per 1000) of physician-diagnosed type 1 diabetes in youth aged 0 through 19 years and type 2 diabetes in youth aged 10 through 19 years. RESULTS: In 2001, 4958 of 3.3 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.48 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.44-1.52). In 2009, 6666 of 3.4 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.93 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.88-1.97). In 2009, the highest prevalence of type 1 diabetes was 2.55 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 2.48-2.62) and the lowest was 0.35 per 1000 in American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.26-0.47) and type 1 diabetes increased between 2001 and 2009 in all sex, age, and race/ethnic subgroups except for those with the lowest prevalence (age 0-4 years and American Indians). Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 21.1% (95% CI, 15.6%-27.0%) increase in type 1 diabetes over 8 years. In 2001, 588 of 1.7 million youth were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.34 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.31-0.37). In 2009, 819 of 1.8 million were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.46 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.43-0.49). In 2009, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 1.20 per 1000 among American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.96-1.51); 1.06 per 1000 among black youth (95% CI, 0.93-1.22); 0.79 per 1000 among Hispanic youth (95% CI, 0.70-0.88); and 0.17 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 0.15-0.20). Significant increases occurred between 2001 and 2009 in both sexes, all age-groups, and in white, Hispanic, and black youth, with no significant changes for Asian Pacific Islanders and American Indians. Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 30.5% (95% CI, 17.3%-45.1%) overall increase in type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 2001 and 2009 in 5 areas of the United States, the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents increased. Further studies are required to determine the causes of these increases.",,,4,,,
2547,"Etiological approach to characterization of diabetes type: the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study OBJECTIVE: To describe an etiologic approach to classification of diabetes types in youth based on the 1997 American Diabetes Association (ADA) framework, using data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SEARCH conducted a comprehensive assessment of 2,291 subjects aged < 20 years with recently diagnosed diabetes. Using autoimmunity (at least one of two diabetes autoantibodies) and insulin sensitivity (equation validated against hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps) as the main etiologic markers, we described four categories along a bidimensional spectrum: autoimmune plus insulin-sensitive (IS), autoimmune plus insulin-resistant (IR), nonautoimmune plus IS, and nonautoimmune plus IR. We then explored how characteristics, including genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity (HLA genotypes), insulin deficiency, and clinical factors varied across these four categories. RESULTS: Most subjects fell into either the autoimmune plus IS (54.5%) or nonautoimmune plus IR categories (15.9%) and had characteristics that align with traditional descriptions of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The group classified as autoimmune plus IR (19.5%) had similar prevalence and titers of diabetes autoantibodies and similar distribution of HLA risk genotypes to those in the autoimmune plus IS group, suggesting that it includes individuals with type 1 diabetes who are obese. The group classified as nonautoimmune plus IS (10.1%) likely includes individuals with undetected autoimmunity but may also include those with monogenic diabetes and thus requires further testing. CONCLUSIONS: The SEARCH study offers researchers and clinicians a practical application for the etiologic classification of diabetes type and at the same time identifies a group of youths who would benefit from further testing.",,,4,,,
2548,"Trends in the prevalence of ketoacidosis at diabetes diagnosis: the SEARCH for diabetes in youth study OBJECTIVE: To estimate temporal changes in the prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in youth and to explore factors associated with its occurrence. METHODS: Five centers identified incident cases of diabetes among youth aged 0 to 19 years starting in 2002. DKA presence was defined as a bicarbonate level < 15 mmol/L and/or a pH < 7.25 (venous) or < 7.30 (arterial or capillary) or mention of DKA in the medical records. We assessed trends in the prevalence of DKA over 3 time periods (2002-2003, 2004-2005, and 2008-2010). Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with DKA. RESULTS: In youth with type 1 diabetes (n = 5615), the prevalence of DKA was high and stable over time (30.2% in 2002-2003, 29.1% in 2004-2005, and 31.1% in 2008-2010; P for trend = .42). Higher prevalence was associated with younger age at diagnosis (P < .0001), minority race/ethnicity (P = .019), income (P = .019), and lack of private health insurance (P = 008). Among youth with type 2 diabetes (n = 1425), DKA prevalence decreased from 11.7% in 2002-2003 to 5.7% in 2008-2010 (P for trend = .005). Higher prevalence was associated with younger age at diagnosis (P = .001), minority race/ethnicity (P = .013), and male gender (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of DKA in youth with type 1 diabetes, although stable, remains high, indicating a persistent need for increased awareness of signs and symptoms of diabetes and better access to health care. In youth with type 2 diabetes, DKA at onset is less common and is decreasing over time.",,,4,,,
2549,"Association of type 1 diabetes vs type 2 diabetes diagnosed during childhood and adolescence with complications during teenage years and young adulthood Importance: The burden and determinants of complications and comorbidities in contemporary youth-onset diabetes are unknown. Objective: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for complications related to type 1 diabetes vs type 2 diabetes among teenagers and young adults who had been diagnosed with diabetes during childhood and adolescence. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational study from 2002 to 2015 in 5 US locations, including 2018 participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes diagnosed at younger than 20 years, with single outcome measures between 2011 and 2015. Exposures: Type 1 and type 2 diabetes and established risk factors (hemoglobin A1c level, body mass index, waist-height ratio, and mean arterial blood pressure). Main Outcomes and Measures: Diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, arterial stiffness, and hypertension. Results: Of 2018 participants, 1746 had type 1 diabetes (mean age, 17.9 years [SD, 4.1]; 1327 non-Hispanic white [76.0%]; 867 female patients [49.7%]), and 272 had type 2 (mean age, 22.1 years [SD, 3.5]; 72 non-Hispanic white [26.5%]; 181 female patients [66.5%]). Mean diabetes duration was 7.9 years (both groups). Patients with type 2 diabetes vs those with type 1 had higher age-adjusted prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (19.9% vs 5.8%; absolute difference [AD], 14.0%; 95% CI, 9.1%-19.9%; P_< _.001), retinopathy (9.1% vs 5.6%; AD, 3.5%; 95% CI, 0.4%-7.7%; P_=_.02), peripheral neuropathy (17.7% vs 8.5%; AD, 9.2%; 95% CI, 4.8%-14.4%; P_< _.001), arterial stiffness (47.4% vs 11.6%; AD, 35.9%; 95% CI, 29%-42.9%; P_< _.001), and hypertension (21.6% vs 10.1%; AD, 11.5%; 95% CI, 6.8%-16.9%; P_< _.001), but not cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (15.7% vs 14.4%; AD, 1.2%; 95% CI, -3.1% to 6.5; P_=_.62). After adjustment for established risk factors measured over time, participants with type 2 diabetes vs those with type 1 had significantly higher odds of diabetic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% CI, 1.39-4.81; P=.003), retinopathy (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.11-4.50; P_=_.02), and peripheral neuropathy (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.43-4.43; P_=_.001), but no significant difference in the odds of arterial stiffness (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.63-1.84; P_=_.80) and hypertension (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.50-1.45; P_=_.55). Conclusions and Relevance: Among teenagers and young adults who had been diagnosed with diabetes during childhood or adolescence, the prevalence of complications and comorbidities was higher among those with type 2 diabetes compared with type 1, but frequent in both groups. These findings support early monitoring of youth with diabetes for development of complications.",,,4,,,

2551,"Serum N-propeptide of collagen IIA (PIIANP) as a marker of radiographic osteoarthritis burden OBJECTIVE: Cartilage homeostasis relies on a balance of catabolism and anabolism of cartilage matrix. Our goal was to evaluate the burden of radiographic osteoarthritis and serum levels of type IIA procollagen amino terminal propeptide (sPIIANP), a biomarker representing type II collagen synthesis, in osteoarthritis. METHODS: OA burden was quantified on the basis of radiographic features as total joint faces with an osteophyte, joint space narrowing, or in the spine, disc space narrowing. sPIIANP was measured in 1,235 participants from the Genetics of Generalized Osteoarthritis study using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Separate multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index and additionally for ipsilateral osteophytes or joint/disc space narrowing, were used to assess the independent association of sPIIANP with osteophytes and with joint/disc space narrowing burden in knees, hips, hands and spine, individually and together. RESULTS: After full adjustment, sPIIANP was significantly associated with a lesser burden of hip joint space narrowing and knee osteophytes. sPIIANP was associated with a lesser burden of hand joint space narrowing but a greater burden of hand osteophytes; these results were only evident upon adjustment for osteoarthritic features in all other joints. There were no associations of sPIIANP and features of spine osteoarthritis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher cartilage collagen synthesis, as reflected in systemic PIIANP concentrations, was associated with lesser burden of osteoarthritic features in lower extremity joints (knees and hips), even accounting for osteoarthritis burden in hands and spine, age, sex and body mass index. These results suggest that pro-anabolic agents may be appropriate for early treatment to prevent severe lower extremity large joint osteoarthritis.",,,9,,,
2552,"Connexin-related (DFNB1) hearing loss: is routine computed tomography imaging necessary? OBJECTIVES: Determine if routine computed tomography (CT) imaging is necessary in the workup for children with connexin-related (DFNB1) sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). STUDY DESIGN: Case-control retrospective chart and imaging review. SETTING: Tertiary care otolaryngology practice. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: High-resolution temporal bone CT scans of children (n = 21) with DFNB1 SNHL were compared to age-matched controls with either conductive hearing loss (CHL, n = 33) or a nonsyndromic, non-DFNB1 SNHL (n = 33). Sixteen measurements of cochleo-vestibular structures were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated analysis of variance model that controlled for both age and gender. Area under the curve (AUC) and multidimensional AUC (MAUC) analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Overall, no statistically significant differences were found between the 3 experimental groups. In addition, comparisons between the DFNB1 and CHL groups, DFNB1 and non-DFNB1 SNHL groups, and CHL and non-DFNB1 SNHL groups failed to demonstrate any statistically significant differences. AUC and MAUC analyses also failed to detect any significant differences between the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DFNB1 SNHL do not have significant anatomic differences on temporal bone CT scans when compared to non-DFNB1 SNHL and CHL control groups. Based on the above analysis, it is reasonable to avoid routine CT imaging of the temporal bones in children with known DFNB1 SNHL unless otherwise clinically indicated. _ American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2015.",,,1,,,
2553,"Does lower birth order amplify the association between high socioeconomic status and central adiposity in young adult Filipino males? OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that lower birth order amplifies the positive association between socioeconomic status and central adiposity in young adult males from a lower income, developing country context. DESIGN: The Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey is an ongoing community-based, observational study of a 1-year birth cohort (1983). SUBJECTS: 970 young adult males, mean age 21.5 years (2005). MEASUREMENTS: Central adiposity measured by waist circumference; birth order; perinatal maternal characteristics including height, arm fat area, age and smoking behavior; socioeconomic status at birth and in young adulthood. RESULTS: Lower birth order was associated with higher waist circumference and increased odds of high waist circumference, even after adjustment for socioeconomic status in young adulthood and maternal characteristics that could impact later offspring adiposity. Furthermore, the positive association between socioeconomic status and central adiposity was amplified in individuals characterized by lower birth order. CONCLUSIONS: This research has failed to reject the mismatch hypothesis, which posits that maternal constraint of fetal growth acts to program developing physiology in a manner that increases susceptibility to the obesogenic effects of modern environments.",,,4,,,
2554,"The spatial distribution of overweight and obesity among a birth cohort of young adult Filipinos (Cebu Philippines, 2005): an application of the Kulldorff spatial scan statistic OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to test for spatial clustering of obesity in a cohort of young adults in the Philippines, to estimate the locations of any clusters, and to relate these to neighborhood-level urbanicity and individual-level socioeconomic status (SES). SUBJECTS: Data are from a birth cohort of young adult (mean age 22 years) Filipino males (n=988) and females (n=820) enrolled in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. METHODS: We used the Kulldorff spatial scan statistic to detect clusters associated with unusually low or high prevalences of overweight or obesity (defined using body mass index, waist circumference and body fat percentage). Cluster locations were compared to neighborhood-level urbanicity, which was measured with a previously validated scale. Individual-level SES was adjusted for using a principal components analysis of household assets. RESULTS: High-prevalence clusters were typically centered in urban areas, but often extended into peri-urban and even rural areas. There were also differences in clustering by both sex and the measure of obesity used. Evidence of clustering in males, but not females, was much weaker after adjustment for SES.",,,9,,,
2555,"Associations between multiple indicators of socioeconomic status and obesity in young adult Filipinos vary by gender, urbanicity, and indicator used More research is needed on the socio-environmental determinants of obesity in lower- and middle-income countries. We used generalized estimating equations to evaluate the cross-sectional effect of urban residence and multiple individual-level indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) on the odds of overweight or central adiposity in a birth cohort of young adult (mean age 21.5 y) Filipino males (n = 987) and females (n = 819) enrolled in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. Overweight was defined as BMI >/=25 kg/m(2) and central adiposity was defined as a waist circumference >85 cm for males or >80 cm for females. Community-level urbanicity was measured on a continuous scale. Multiple indicators of SES included assets, income, education, and marital status. In the final multivariable models, assets and being married were positively related to overweight and central adiposity in males (P < 0.05), but being married was the only predictor of these outcomes in females. However, once the modifying effects of urban residence were accounted for, assets were positively related to overweight and central adiposity among the most rural women, but not in more urban women. Our results are consistent with a growing body of literature that suggests the relationship between SES and obesity is positive in lower-income contexts and inverse in higher-income contexts, particularly in females. The pattern of relationships we observed suggests that as the Philippines continues to develop economically, the public health impact of obesity will increase similarly to what has been observed in countries further along in their economic transition.",,,9,,,
2556,"Constrained Score Statistics Identify Genetic Variants Interacting with Multiple Risk Factors in Barrett's Esophagus Few gene-environment interactions (G _ E) have been discovered in cancer epidemiology thus far, in part due to the large number of possible G _ E to be investigated and inherent low statistical power of traditional analytic methods for discovering G _ E. We consider simultaneously testing for interactions between several related exposures and a genetic variant in a genome-wide study. To improve power, constrained testing strategies are proposed for multivariate gene-environment interactions at two levels: interactions that have the same direction (one-sided or bidirectional hypotheses) or are proportional to respective exposure main effects (a variant of Tukey's one-degree test). Score statistics were developed to expedite the genome-wide computation. We conducted extensive simulations to evaluate validity and power performance of the proposed statistics, applied them to the genetic and environmental exposure data for esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus from the Barretts Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON), and discovered three loci simultaneously interacting with gastresophageal reflux, obesity, and tobacco smoking with genome-wide significance. These findings deepen understanding of the genetic and environmental architecture of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Copyright _ 2016 American Society of Human Genetics.

2557,"Lifestyle change in Kerala, India: needs assessment and planning for a community-based diabetes prevention trial BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has become a major public health challenge in India. Factors relevant to the development and implementation of diabetes prevention programmes in resource-constrained countries, such as India, have been under-studied. The purpose of this study is to describe the findings from research aimed at informing the development and evaluation of a Diabetes Prevention Programme in Kerala, India (K-DPP). METHODS: Data were collected from three main sources: (1) a systematic review of key research literature; (2) a review of relevant policy documents; and (3) focus groups conducted among individuals with a high risk of progressing to diabetes. The key findings were then triangulated and synthesised. RESULTS: Prevalence of risk factors for diabetes is very high and increasing in Kerala. This situation is largely attributable to rapid changes in the lifestyle of people living in this state of India. The findings from the systematic review and focus groups identified many environmental and personal determinants of these unhealthy lifestyle changes, including: less than ideal accessibility to and availability of health services; cultural values and norms; optimistic bias and other misconceptions related to risk; and low expectations regarding one's ability to make lifestyle changes in order to influence health and disease outcomes. On the other hand, there are existing intervention trials conducted in India which suggests that risk reduction is possible. These programmes utilize multi-level strategies including mass media, as well as strategies to enhance community and individual empowerment. India's national programme for the prevention and control of major non-communicable diseases (NCD) also provide a supportive environment for further community-based efforts to prevent diabetes. CONCLUSION: These findings provide strong support for undertaking more research into the conduct of community-based diabetes prevention in the rural areas of Kerala. We aim to develop, implement and evaluate a group-based peer support programme that will address cultural and family determinants of lifestyle risks, including family decision-making regarding adoption of healthy dietary and physical activity patterns. Furthermore, we believe that this approach will be feasible, acceptable and effective in these communities; with the potential for scale-up in other parts of India.",,,4,,,
2558,"Cash transfers, early marriage, and fertility in malawi and zambia There is increasing interest in the ability of cash transfers to facilitate safe transitions to adulthood in low-income settings; however, evidence from scaled-up government programming demonstrating this potential is scarce. Using two experimental evaluations of unconditional cash transfers targeted to ultra-poor and labor-constrained households over approximately three years in Malawi and Zambia, we examine whether cash transfers delayed early marriage and pregnancy among youth aged 14 to 21_years at baseline. Although we find strong impacts on poverty and schooling, two main pathways hypothesized in the literature, we find limited impacts on safe transition outcomes for both males and females. In addition, despite hypotheses that social norms may constrain potential impacts of cash transfer programs, we show suggestive evidence that pre-program variation in social norms across communities does not significantly affect program impact. We conclude with policy implications and suggestions for future research. _ 2018 The Population Council, Inc.",,,2,,,
2559,"The Local Food Environment and Body Mass Index among the Urban Poor in Accra, Ghana Obesity in the sub-Saharan Africa region has been portrayed as a problem of affluence, partly because obesity has been found to be more common in urban areas and among the rich. Recent findings, however, reveal rising prevalence among the poor particularly the urban poor. A growing body of literature mostly in Western countries shows that obesity among the poor is partly the result of an obesogenic-built environment. Such studies are lacking in the African context. This study examines the characteristics of the local food environment in an urban poor setting in Accra, Ghana and further investigates the associated risk of obesity for residents. Data on the local food environment was collected using geographic positioning system (GPS) technology. The body mass indices (BMI) of females (15-49_years) and males (15-59_years) were calculated from measured weight and height. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviors of respondents was also collected through a household survey. Spatial analysis tools were used to examine the characteristics of the local food environment while the influence of the food environment on BMI was examined using a two-level multilevel model. The measures of the food environment constituted the level 2 factors while individual socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviors constituted the level 1 factors. The local food environment in the study communities is suggestive of an obesogenic food environment characterized by an abundance of out-of-home cooked foods, convenience stores, and limited fruits and vegetables options. The results of the multilevel analysis reveal a 0.2 kg/m(2) increase in BMI for every additional convenience store and a 0.1 kg/m(2) reduction in BMI for every out-of-home cooked food place available in the study area after controlling for individual socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and community characteristics. The findings of this study indicate that the local food environment in urban poor Accra is associated with increased risk of obesity through providing access to convenience stores. In order to reduce the risk of obesity in these urban poor communities, there is the need to regulate the availability of and access to convenience stores while also encouraging healthier offerings in convenience stores.",,,1,,,
2560,"Validity of self-reported breast cancer characteristics in a nationwide cohort of women with a family history of breast cancer BACKGROUND: Women may have incomplete understanding of a breast cancer diagnosis, leading to inaccurate reporting in epidemiological studies. However, it is not feasible to obtain consent for medical records from all women participating in a study. Therefore, it is important to determine how well self-reported breast cancer characteristics correspond with what is found in medical records, but few studies have evaluated agreement of self-reported breast cancer characteristics with abstracted medical records. METHODS: We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) of self-reports compared to medical records and explored whether participant characteristics may have influenced reporting accuracy. We analyzed data from 2518 reported breast cancer cases from the Sister Study, a large nationwide cohort of women with a family history of breast cancer. RESULTS: Medical records or pathology reports were obtained for 2066 of 2518 (82%) women who reported incident breast cancer. Breast cancer was confirmed for over 99% (n_=_2054) of women with medical records. Confirmation rates were high for invasive, ductal, hormone receptor positive, and HER2 negative breast cancers, with little variation by race/ethnicity or age. Self-reported in situ breast cancer had a lower PPV (64.2%), with medical records showing invasive breast cancer instead, especially for older and Hispanic women. Hormone receptor (ER and PR) negative and HER2 positive self-reports had lower PPVs (83.0%, 71.6%, and 66.1% respectively). Hispanic women and women ages 65 or older at diagnosis were less able to accurately report breast cancer stage, excluding stage I. CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy of reporting overall breast cancer and common subtypes is high. Despite having a family history of breast cancer and voluntarily enrolling in a study evaluating breast cancer risk factors, participants may have greater difficulty distinguishing between in situ and invasive breast cancer and may less accurately report other less common subtypes. Discrepancies may reflect women's poor understanding of information conveyed by health care providers or lack of consistent terminology used to describe subtypes.",,,3,,,
2561,"Patient characteristics associated with favorable perceptions of patient-provider communication in early-stage lung cancer treatment Perceived quality of lung cancer communication is strongly associated with receiving potentially curative surgery for early-stage disease. The patient characteristics associated with poor quality communication in the setting of new lung cancer diagnosis are not known, although race may be a contributing factor. Using data from a prospective study of decision making in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients in five academic and community medical centers (N_=_386), the authors used logistic regression techniques to identify patient-level characteristics correlated with scoring in the lowest quartile of a communication scale and a single-item communication variable describing shared communication. Income, lung cancer diagnostic status, and trust score were significantly associated with the overall communication scale. Lung cancer diagnostic status and trust score were also associated with patient perceptions of the single shared communication item, in addition to participation in a religious organization. Improving patient perceptions of communication with their provider is an important next step in ensuring that eligible patients receive optimal care for this deadly disease. This analysis identifies several modifiable factors that could improve patient perceptions of patient-provider communication. The fact that patient perception of communication is a predictor of the decision to undergo surgery independent of race highlights the need for broad communication interventions to ensure that as many eligible patients as possible are receiving surgery.",,,3,,,
2562,"Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 306 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 188 countries, 1990-2013: quantifying the epidemiological transition BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes, age-sex groups, and countries. The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. METHODS: We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. FINDINGS: Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6_2 years (95% UI 5_6-6_6), from 65_3 years (65_0-65_6) in 1990 to 71_5 years (71_0-71_9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5_4 years (4_9-5_8), from 56_9 years (54_5-59_1) to 62_3 years (59_7-64_8), total DALYs fell by 3_6% (0_3-7_4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100_000 people fell by 26_7% (24_6-29_1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. INTERPRETATION: Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relativel constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition--in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden--is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

2563,"Comparative patient-centered outcomes (health state and adverse sexual symptoms) between adjuvant brachytherapy versus no adjuvant brachytherapy in early stage endometrial cancer PURPOSE: To determine a relationship between sexual functioning and health state among survivors of stage I endometrial cancer, and to examine whether adjuvant intravaginal radiotherapy (IVRT) affects these measures compared to hysterectomy alone. METHODS: Two hundred five survivors (>1_year from surgery) completed questionnaires containing the EuroQol (EQ5D) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). A total of 136 (66.3_%) underwent surgery alone, and 69 (33.7_%) received IVRT. Pearson correlation was used to correlate FSFI and EQ5D-Health State scores. Multivariable regression was performed to measure the impact of IVRT on sexual functioning and health state.

A significant correlation was detected between FSFI and EQ5D scores (Pearson correlation_=_0.21, p_=_0.003). Compared to the IVRT group, the surgery group was younger (p_=_0.001) and trended toward more frequent use of minimally invasive surgery versus laparotomy (p_=_0.08). Otherwise, the two groups were well balanced with respect to demographics, comorbidities, and baseline sexual activity. Controlling for age and surgery type, IVRT was not associated with poorer health state or sexual function. Receipt of laparotomy was associated with both poorer health state and sexual function (p_=_0.0156 and p_=_0.0247, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual functioning was generally poor among endometrial cancer survivors; however, those with improved FSFI scores tended to have superior health states. IVRT was not a significant risk factor; however, receipt of laparotomy appeared to be associated with poorer sexual functioning and health state.",,,1,,,
2564,"Sociodemographic Disparities in Proximity of Schools to Tobacco Outlets and Fast-Food Restaurants OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of school sociodemographic characteristics with tobacco outlet and fast-food restaurant availability near schools in a national study. METHODS: Business lists and data from the National Center for Education Statistics were used to calculate the numbers of tobacco outlets and fast-food restaurants within 800 meters of public schools in 97 US counties. RESULTS: More than 50% of schools with a majority of Hispanic students had both a fast-food restaurant and tobacco outlet nearby, compared with 21% of schools with a majority of White students. In adjusted models, each 10% increase in the number of low-income and Hispanic students enrolled in a school led to a 3% to 5% increase in the odds of the school having both a fast-food restaurant and a tobacco outlet nearby. CONCLUSIONS: Low-income and Hispanic students are disproportionately exposed to both tobacco outlets and fast-food restaurants near their schools. Easy access to tobacco products and fast food may influence youth smoking initiation and contribute to poor dietary intake.",,,4,,,
2565,"Small food store retailers' willingness to implement healthy store strategies in rural north carolina Access to supermarkets is lacking in many rural areas. Small food stores are often available, but typically lack healthy food items such as fresh produce. We assessed small food store retailer willingness to implement 11 healthy store strategies to increase the availability, display, and promotion of healthy foods and decrease the availability, display, and promotion of tobacco products. Interviews were conducted with 55 small food store retailers in three rural North Carolina counties concurrently with store observations assessing current practices related to the strategies. All stores sold low-calorie beverages, sugar-sweetened beverages, candy and cigarettes. Nearly all sold smokeless tobacco and cigars/cigarillos, and 72_% sold e-cigarettes. Fresh fruits were sold at 30.2_% of stores; only 9.4_% sold fresh vegetables. Retailers reported being most willing to stock skim/low-fat milk, display healthy snacks near the register, and stock whole wheat bread. About 50_% were willing to stock at least three fresh fruits and three fresh vegetables, however only 2_% of stores currently stocked these foods. Nearly all retailers expressed unwillingness to reduce the availability of tobacco products or marketing. Our results show promise for working with retailers in rural settings to increase healthy food availability in small food stores. However, restrictions on retail tobacco sales and marketing may be more feasible through local tobacco control ordinances, or could be included with healthy foods ordinances that require stores to stock a minimum amount of healthy foods.",,,4,,,

2567,"E-cigarette availability, price promotions and marketing at the point-of sale in the contiguous United States (2014-2015): National estimates and multilevel correlates Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) sales and use have increased rapidly, yet point-of-sale e-cigarette availability and marketing is understudied. We estimated changes in e-cigarette availability and marketing among tobacco retailers in the U.S., and associations with neighborhood characteristics. A national sample of tobacco retailers in the Contiguous U.S. was audited in 2014 and 2015 (n_=_1,905 and n_=_2,126, respectively) to observe e-cigarette availability and marketing (signs, ads, displays and promotions) and generate national prevalence estimates. Store, neighborhood and state level correlates of 2015 e-cigarette availability, price promotions and exterior advertising were analyzed using multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models. E-cigarettes were sold at 72.0% of retailers in 2014 and at 79.2% in 2015. Price promotions increased from 11.9% to 20.2% of retailers. Among retailers that did not previously sell e-cigarettes in 2012, availability in 2015 was greater for retailers in neighborhoods with the highest proportion of Black residents (vs. lowest). E-cigarette price promotions were more prevalent in neighborhoods with more Hispanic residents, while exterior e-cigarette marketing was more prevalent in neighborhoods with more Black residents. State smoking prevalence was positively associated with e-cigarette availability, promotions and advertising. E-cigarette point-of-sale availability and marketing increased between 2014 and 2015 and expanded to neighborhoods with a higher proportion of Black residents between 2012 and 2015. Retailers located within states with high smoking prevalence appear to be targeted by e-cigarette marketing. As e-cigarettes become the target of more regulations, understanding changes in the e-cigarette retail environment is critical to inform potential policies regulating their sale and marketing. _ 2020 The Authors.",,,6,,,

2569,"Impact of water intake on energy intake and weight status: a systematic review The effects of consuming water with meals rather than drinking no beverage or various other beverages remain under-studied. This systematic review of studies reported in the English-language literature was performed to compare the effects of drinking water and various beverage alternatives on energy intake and/or weight status. Relevant clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, and intervention studies were identified and findings across the literature were summarized. From the clinical trials, average differences were calculated in total energy intake at test meals (DeltaTEI) for each of several beverage categories in comparison with water. The available literature for these comparisons is sparse and somewhat inconclusive. However, one of the most consistent sets of findings was related to adults drinking sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) versus water before a single meal. In these comparisons, total energy intakes were 7.8% higher (DeltaTEI range, -7.5 to 18.9) when SSBs were consumed. Studies comparing non-nutritive sweeteners with water were also relatively consistent and found no impact on energy intake among adults (DeltaTEI, -1.3; range, -9 to 13.8). Much less conclusive evidence was found in studies replacing water with milk and juice, with estimated increases in TEI of 14.9% (range, 10.9 to 23.9%). These findings from clinical trials, along with those from epidemiologic and intervention studies, suggest water has a potentially important role to play in reducing energy intake, and consequently in obesity prevention. A need for randomized-controlled trials to confirm this role exists.",,,7,,,
2570,"Standardization and validation of a novel and simple method to assess lumbar dural sac size AIM: To develop and validate a simple, reproducible method to assess dural sac size using standard imaging technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was institutional review board-approved. Two readers, blinded to the diagnoses, measured anterior-posterior (AP) and transverse (TR) dural sac diameter (DSD), and AP vertebral body diameter (VBD) of the lumbar vertebrae using MRI images from 53 control patients with pre-existing MRI examinations, 19 prospectively MRI-imaged healthy controls, and 24 patients with Marfan syndrome with prior MRI or CT lumbar spine imaging. Statistical analysis utilized linear and logistic regression, Pearson correlation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: AP-DSD and TR-DSD measurements were reproducible between two readers (r_=_0.91 and 0.87, respectively). DSD (L1-L5) was not different between male and female controls in the AP or TR plane (p_=_0.43; p_=_0.40, respectively), and did not vary by age (p_=_0.62; p_=_0.25) or height (p_=_0.64; p_=_0.32). AP-VBD was greater in males versus females (p_=_1.5___10(-8)), resulting in a smaller dural sac ratio (DSR) (DSD/VBD) in males (p_=_5.8___10(-6)). Marfan patients had larger AP-DSDs and TR-DSDs than controls (p_=_5.9___10(-9); p_=_6.5___10(-9), respectively). Compared to DSR, AP-DSD and TR-DSD better discriminate Marfan from control subjects based on area under the curve (AUC) values from unadjusted ROCs (AP-DSD p_< _0.01; TR-DSD p_=_0.04). CONCLUSION: Individual vertebrae and L1-L5 (average) AP-DSD and TR-DSD measurements are simple, reliable, and reproducible for quantitating dural sac size without needing to control for gender, age, or height.

2574,"The role of genetic variants in CRP in radiographic severity in African Americans with early and established rheumatoid arthritis This study investigates the association of CRP (C-reactive protein) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with plasma CRP levels and radiographic severity in African Americans with early and established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using a cross-sectional case-only design, CRP SNPs were genotyped in two independent sets of African Americans with RA: Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African Americans with RA (CLEAR 1) and CLEAR 2. Radiographic data and CRP measurements were available for 294 individuals from CLEAR 1 (median (interquartile range (IQR) 25-75) disease duration of 1 (0.6-1.6) year) and in 407 persons from CLEAR 2 (median (IQR 25-75) disease duration of 8.9 (3.5-17.7) years). In CLEAR 1, in adjusted models, the minor allele of rs2808630 was associated with total radiographic score (incident rate ratio 0.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.74), P-value=0.0051). In CLEAR 2, the minor allele of rs3093062 was associated with increased plasma CRP levels (P-value=0.002). For each rs3093062 minor allele, the plasma CRP increased by 1.51 (95% CI 1.15-1.95) mg__l(-1) when all the other covariates remained constant. These findings have important implications for assessment of the risk of joint damage in African Americans with RA.",,,3,,,
2575,"Do assistive devices, training, and workload affect injury incidence? Prevention efforts by nursing homes and back injuries among nursing assistants AIMS: This paper is a report of a study of association between workplace injuries experienced by nursing assistants in nursing homes in the United States and four factors that may affect injury rates: initial nursing assistant training, training at the current facility, lifting devices, and time to execute daily duties. BACKGROUND: High injury rates among nursing personnel have been reported in multiple settings across countries. The existing literature is divided on the effectiveness of training and assistive devices in reducing injury rates among nursing assistants. METHODS: We examined associations between whether or not the nursing assistant has experienced an injury and four key factors: quality of initial injury prevention training, injury prevention training at current facility, lift availability and whether or not the nursing assistant has sufficient time to complete resident activities of daily living. We estimated a survey-weighted logit model using 2004 National Nursing Assistant Survey data. RESULTS/FINDINGS: The odds of an injury in the past year were lower among nursing assistants who reported always having a lift available when needed (41% lower odds), available facility training to reduce workplace injuries (39%), and sufficient time to complete resident activities of daily living (35%). Quality of initial training to prevent work injuries was not significantly associated with injury status. CONCLUSION: Regions without widespread access to lifting devices may be able to reduce injury rates by increasing the availability of lifting devices. The potential for reductions in injury rates in the United States is greatest from improving training and ensuring adequate time for resident care, as most facilities currently have lifts available. _ 2011 The Authors.

2576,"Is geriatric care associated with less emergency department use? OBJECTIVES: To determine whether community-dwelling individuals and nursing home (NH) residents treated by a geriatrician were less likely to use the emergency department (ED) than individuals treated by other physicians. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using data from a national sample of older adults with a history of cardiovascular disease. SETTING: Ambulatory care or NH. PARTICIPANTS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 and older diagnosed with one or more geriatric conditions from 2004 to 2007 and followed for up to 3 years. MEASUREMENTS: Emergency department use was measured in Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims; geriatric care was measured as geriatrician visits in ambulatory or NH settings coded in physician claims. RESULTS: Multivariable analyses controlled for observed and unobserved subject characteristics that were constant during the study period. For community-dwelling participants, one or more nonhospital geriatrician visits in a 6-month period were associated with 11.3% lower ED use the following month (95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.5-15.0, N = 287,259). Participants who received primary care from geriatricians were less likely to have ED use than those who had traditional primary care. Results for participants who received consultative care from geriatricians were similar to those for participants who received primary care from geriatricians. Results for NH residents (N = 66,551) were similar to those for community-dwelling participants. CONCLUSION: Geriatric care was associated with an estimated 108 fewer ED visits per 1,000 community-dwelling residents and 133 fewer ED visits per 1,000 NH residents per year. Geriatric consultative care in collaboration with primary care providers may be as effective in reducing ED use as geriatric primary care. Increased provision of collaborative care could allow the existing supply of geriatricians to reach a larger number of individuals. _ 2012, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation _ 2012, The American Geriatrics Society.",,,3,,,
2577,"Race-associated biological differences among Luminal A breast tumors African-American (AA) women have higher breast cancer-specific mortality rates. A higher prevalence of the worse outcome Basal-like breast cancer subtype contributes to this, but AA women also have higher mortality even within the more favorable outcome Luminal A breast cancers. These differences may reflect treatment or health care access issues, inherent biological differences, or both. To identify potential biological differences by race among Luminal A breast cancers, gene expression data from 108 CAU and 57 AA breast tumors were analyzed. Race-associated genes were evaluated for associations with survival. Finally, expression of race- and survival-associated genes was evaluated in normal tissue of AA and CAU women. Six genes (ACOX2, MUC1, CRYBB2, PSPH, SQLE, TYMS) were differentially expressed by race among Luminal A breast cancers and were associated with survival (HR < 0.8, HR >1.25). For all six genes, tumors in AA had higher expression of poor prognosis genes (CRYBB2, PSPH, SQLE, TYMS) and lower expression of good prognosis genes (ACOX2, MUC1). A score based on all six genes predicted survival in a large independent dataset (HR = 1.9 top vs. bottom quartile, 95% CI: 1.4-2.5). For four genes, normal tissue of AA and CAU women showed similar expression (ACOX2, MUC1, SQLE, TYMS); however, the poor outcome-associated genes CRYBB2 and PSPH were more highly expressed in AA versus CAU women's normal tissue. This analysis identified gene expression differences that may contribute to mortality disparities and suggests that among Luminal A breast tumors there are biological differences between AA and CAU patients. Some of these differences (CRYBB2 and PSPH) may exist from the earliest stages of tumor development, or may even precede malignancy.",,,3,,,
2578,"A germline variant at 8q24 contributes to familial clustering of prostate cancer in men of african ancestry Although men of African ancestry have a high risk of prostate cancer (PCa), no genes or mutations have been identified that contribute to familial clustering of PCa in this population. We investigated whether the African ancestry-specific PCa risk variant at 8q24, rs72725854, is enriched in men with a PCa family history in 9052 cases, 143 cases from high-risk families, and 8595 controls of African ancestry. We found the risk allele to be significantly associated with earlier age at diagnosis, more aggressive disease, and enriched in men with a PCa family history (32% of high-risk familial cases carried the variant vs 23% of cases without a family history and 12% of controls). For cases with two or more first-degree relatives with PCa who had at least one family member diagnosed at age < 60__r, the odds ratios for TA heterozygotes and TT homozygotes were 3.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]_=_2.13-7.22) and 33.41 (95% CI_=_10.86-102.84), respectively. Among men with a PCa family history, the absolute risk by age 60__r reached 21% (95% CI_=_17-25%) for TA heterozygotes and 38% (95% CI_=_13-65%) for TT homozygotes. We estimate that in men of African ancestry, rs72725854 accounts for 32% of the total familial risk explained by all known PCa risk variants. PATIENT SUMMARY: We found that rs72725854, an African ancestry-specific risk variant, is more common in men with a family history of prostate cancer and in those diagnosed with prostate cancer at younger ages. Men of African ancestry may benefit from the knowledge of their carrier status for this genetic risk variant to guide decisions about prostate cancer screening. Copyright _ 2020 The Authors.

2579,"Biomass cooking fuels and health outcomes for women in malawi In sub-Saharan Africa, biomass fuels account for approximately 90% of household energy consumption. Limited evidence exists on the association between different biomass fuels and health outcomes. We report results from a cross-sectional sample of 655 households in Malawi. We calculated odds ratios between hypothesized determinants of household air pollution (HAP) exposure (fuel, stove type, and cooking location) and five categories of health outcomes (cardiopulmonary, respiratory, neurologic, eye health, and burns). Reliance on high- or low-quality firewood or crop residue (vs. charcoal) was associated with significantly higher odds of shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pains, night phlegm, forgetfulness, dizziness, and dry irritated eyes. Use of high-quality firewood was associated with significantly lower odds of persistent phlegm. Cooks in rural areas (vs. urban areas) had significantly higher odds of experiencing shortness of breath, persistent cough, and phlegm, but significantly lower odds of phlegm, forgetfulness, and burns. With deforestation and population pressures increasing reliance on low-quality biomass fuels, prevalence of HAP-related cardiopulmonary and neurologic symptoms will likely increase among cooks. Short- to medium-term strategies are needed to secure access to high-quality biomass fuels given limited potential for scalable transitions to modern energy.",,,2,,,
2580,"Alcohol consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer for mismatch repair gene mutation carriers Background: People with germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes have increased colorectal cancer risk. For these high-risk people, study findings of the relationship between alcohol consumption and colorectal cancer risk have been inconclusive.Methods: 1,925 MMR gene mutations carriers recruited into the Colon Cancer Family Registry who had completed a questionnaire on lifestyle factors were included. Weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between alcohol consumption and colorectal cancer.Results: Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 769 carriers (40%) at a mean (SD) age of 42.6 (10.3) years. Compared with abstention, ethanol consumption from any alcoholic beverage up to 14 g/day and >28 g/day was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.09-2.07 and 1.69; 95% CI, 1.07-2.65, respectively; Ptrend = 0.05), and colon cancer risk (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.27-2.49 and 1.94; 95% CI, 1.19-3.18, respectively; Ptrend = 0.02). However, there was no clear evidence for an association with rectal cancer risk. Also, there was no evidence for associations between consumption of individual alcoholic beverage types (beer, wine, spirits) and colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer risk.Conclusions: Our data suggest that alcohol consumption, particularly more than 28 g/day of ethanol (_2 standard drinks of alcohol in the United States), is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk for MMR gene mutation carriers.Impact: Although these data suggested that alcohol consumption in MMR carriers was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk, there was no evidence of a dose-response, and not all types of alcohol consumption were associated with increased risk.

2581,"Female hormonal factors and the risk of endometrial cancer in lynch syndrome IMPORTANCE: Apart from hysterectomy, there is no consensus recommendation for reducing endometrial cancer risk for women with a mismatch repair gene mutation (Lynch syndrome). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between hormonal factors and endometrial cancer risk in Lynch syndrome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study included 1128 women with a mismatch repair gene mutation identified from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Data were analyzed with a weighted cohort approach. Participants were recruited between 1997 and 2012 from centers across the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. EXPOSURES: Age at menarche, first and last live birth, and menopause; number of live births; hormonal contraceptive use; and postmenopausal hormone use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported diagnosis of endometrial cancer. RESULTS: Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 133 women (incidence rate per 100 person-years, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.34). Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 11% (n_=_70) of women with age at menarche greater than or equal to 13 years compared with 12.6% (n_=_57) of women with age at menarche less than 13 years (incidence rate per 100 person-years, 0.27 vs 0.31; rate difference, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.15 to 0.05]; hazard ratio per year, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73 to 0.99]; P_=_.04). Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 10.8% (n_=_88) of parous women compared with 14.4% (n_=_40) of nulliparous women (incidence rate per 100 person-years, 0.25 vs 0.43; rate difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.32 to -0.04]; hazard ratio, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.42]; P_< _.001). Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 8.7% (n_=_70) of women who used hormonal contraceptives greater than or equal to 1 year compared with 19.2% (n_=_57) of women who used contraceptives less than 1 year (incidence rate per 100 person-years, 0.22 vs 0.45; rate difference, -0.23 [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.11]; hazard ratio, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.64]; P_< _.001). There was no statistically significant association between endometrial cancer and age at first and last live birth, age at menopause, and postmenopausal hormone use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For women with a mismatch repair gene mutation, some endogenous and exogenous hormonal factors were associated with a lower risk of endometrial cancer. These directions and strengths of associations were similar to those for the general population. If replicated, these findings suggest that women with a mismatch repair gene mutation may be counseled like the general population in regard to hormonal influences on endometrial cancer risk.",,,3,,,
2582,"Novel loci for adiponectin levels and their influence on type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits: a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of 45,891 individuals Circulating levels of adiponectin, a hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are highly heritable and are inversely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and other metabolic traits. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in 39,883 individuals of European ancestry to identify genes associated with metabolic disease. We identified 8 novel loci associated with adiponectin levels and confirmed 2 previously reported loci (P_=_4.5_10(-8)-1.2_10(-43)). Using a novel method to combine data across ethnicities (N_=_4,232 African Americans, N_=_1,776 Asians, and N_=_29,347 Europeans), we identified two additional novel loci. Expression analyses of 436 human adipocyte samples revealed that mRNA levels of 18 genes at candidate regions were associated with adiponectin concentrations after accounting for multiple testing (p<3_10(-4)). We next developed a multi-SNP genotypic risk score to test the association of adiponectin decreasing risk alleles on metabolic traits and diseases using consortia-level meta-analytic data. This risk score was associated with increased risk of T2D (p_=_4.3_10(-3), n_=_22,044), increased triglycerides (p_=_2.6_10(-14), n_=_93,440), increased waist-to-hip ratio (p_=_1.8_10(-5), n_=_77,167), increased glucose two hours post oral glucose tolerance testing (p_=_4.4_10(-3), n_=_15,234), increased fasting insulin (p_=_0.015, n_=_48,238), but with lower in HDL-cholesterol concentrations (p_=_4.5_10(-13), n_=_96,748) and decreased BMI (p_=_1.4_10(-4), n_=_121,335). These findings identify novel genetic determinants of adiponectin levels, which, taken together, influence risk of T2D and markers of insulin resistance.",,,8,,,

Trust is critical in the development and maintaining of effective collaborations. The aim of this pilot study was to engage stakeholders in defining determinants of trust in community academic research partnerships and to develop a framework for measuring trust. METHODS: The study was conducted by five collaborating National Institute of Health' Clinical and Translational Sciences Awardees. We used concept mapping to engage three stakeholders: community members, healthcare providers and academicians. We conducted hierarchical cluster analysis to assess the determinants of trust in community-academic research partnerships. RESULTS: A total of 186 participants provided input generating 2,172 items that were consolidated into 125 unique items. A five cluster solution was defined: authentic, effective and transparent communication; mutually respectful and reciprocal relationships; sustainability; committed partnerships; and, communication, credibility and methodology to anticipate and resolve problems.

2584,"Genome-wide meta-analyses of smoking behaviors in African Americans The identification and exploration of genetic loci that influence smoking behaviors have been conducted primarily in populations of the European ancestry. Here we report results of the first genome-wide association study meta-analysis of smoking behavior in African Americans in the Study of Tobacco in Minority Populations Genetics Consortium (n = 32,389). We identified one non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2036527[A]) on chromosome 15q25.1 associated with smoking quantity (cigarettes per day), which exceeded genome-wide significance (_ = 0.040, s.e. = 0.007, P = 1.84 _ 10(-8)). This variant is present in the 5'-distal enhancer region of the CHRNA5 gene and defines the primary index signal reported in studies of the European ancestry. No other SNP reached genome-wide significance for smoking initiation (SI, ever vs never smoking), age of SI, or smoking cessation (SC, former vs current smoking). Informative associations that approached genome-wide significance included three modestly correlated variants, at 15q25.1 within PSMA4, CHRNA5 and CHRNA3 for smoking quantity, which are associated with a second signal previously reported in studies in European ancestry populations, and a signal represented by three SNPs in the SPOCK2 gene on chr10q22.1. The association at 15q25.1 confirms this region as an important susceptibility locus for smoking quantity in men and women of African ancestry. Larger studies will be needed to validate the suggestive loci that did not reach genome-wide significance and further elucidate the contribution of genetic variation to disparities in cigarette consumption, SC and smoking-attributable disease between African Americans and European Americans.",,,8,,,
2585,"Genetic contributions to variation in general cognitive function: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in the CHARGE consortium (N=53949) General cognitive function is substantially heritable across the human life course from adolescence to old age. We investigated the genetic contribution to variation in this important, health- and well-being-related trait in middle-aged and older adults. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of 31 cohorts (N=53,949) in which the participants had undertaken multiple, diverse cognitive tests. A general cognitive function phenotype was tested for, and created in each cohort by principal component analysis. We report 13 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in three genomic regions, 6q16.1, 14q12 and 19q13.32 (best SNP and closest gene, respectively: rs10457441, P=3.93 _ 10(-9), MIR2113; rs17522122, P=2.55 _ 10(-8), AKAP6; rs10119, P=5.67 _ 10(-9), APOE/TOMM40). We report one gene-based significant association with the HMGN1 gene located on chromosome 21 (P=1 _ 10(-6)). These genes have previously been associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Meta-analysis results are consistent with a polygenic model of inheritance. To estimate SNP-based heritability, the genome-wide complex trait analysis procedure was applied to two large cohorts, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (N=6617) and the Health and Retirement Study (N=5976). The proportion of phenotypic variation accounted for by all genotyped common SNPs was 29% (s.e.=5%) and 28% (s.e.=7%), respectively. Using polygenic prediction analysis, ~1.2% of the variance in general cognitive function was predicted in the Generation Scotland cohort (N=5487; P=1.5 _ 10(-17)). In hypothesis-driven tests, there was significant association between general cognitive function and four genes previously associated with Alzheimer's disease: TOMM40, APOE, ABCG1 and MEF2C.",,,8,,,
2586,"Study of 300,486 individuals identifies 148 independent genetic loci influencing general cognitive function General cognitive function is a prominent and relatively stable human trait that is associated with many important life outcomes.

Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function.",,,1,,,

2588,"Prevalence of low cardiovascular risk profile among diverse hispanic/latino adults in the united states by age, sex, and level of acculturation: the hispanic community health study/study of latinos BACKGROUND: Favorable levels of all readily measurable major cardiovascular disease risk factors (ie, low risk [LR]) are associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Data are not available on LR prevalence among Hispanic/Latino adults of diverse ethnic backgrounds. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of a low cardiovascular disease risk profile among Hispanic/Latino adults in the United States and to examine cross-sectional associations of LR with measures of acculturation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The multicenter, prospective, population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos examined 16_415 men and women aged 18 to 74_years at baseline (2008-2011) with diverse Hispanic/Latino backgrounds. Analyses involved 14_757 adults (mean age 41.3_years; 60.6% women). LR was defined using national guidelines for favorable levels of serum cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index and by not having diabetes mellitus and not currently smoking. Age-adjusted LR prevalence was low (8.4% overall; 5.1% for men, 11.2% for women) and varied by background (4.2% in men of Mexican heritage versus 15.0% in women of Cuban heritage). Lower acculturation (assessed using proxy measures) was significantly associated with higher odds of a LR profile among women only: Age-adjusted odds ratios of having LR were 1.64 (95% CI 1.24-2.17) for foreign-born versus US-born women and 1.96 (95% CI 1.49-2.58) for women residing in the United States < 10 versus _10_years. CONCLUSIONS: Among diverse US Hispanic/Latino adults, the prevalence of a LR profile is low. Lower acculturation is associated with higher odds of a LR profile among women but not men. Comprehensive public health strategies are needed to improve the cardiovascular health of US Hispanic/Latino adults. _ 2016 The Authors.

2589,"Prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases among Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse backgrounds in the United States CONTEXT: Major cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are leading causes of mortality among US Hispanic and Latino individuals. Comprehensive data are limited regarding the prevalence of CVD risk factors in this population and relations of these traits to socioeconomic status (SES) and acculturation. OBJECTIVES: To describe prevalence of major CVD risk factors and CVD (coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) among US Hispanic/Latino individuals of different backgrounds, examine relationships of SES and acculturation with CVD risk profiles and CVD, and assess cross-sectional associations of CVD risk factors with CVD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, prospective, population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos including individuals of Cuban (n = 2201), Dominican (n = 1400), Mexican (n = 6232), Puerto Rican (n = 2590), Central American (n = 1634), and South American backgrounds (n = 1022) aged 18 to 74 years. Analyses involved 15,079 participants with complete data enrolled between March 2008 and June 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adverse CVD risk factors defined using national guidelines for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking. Prevalence of CHD and stroke were ascertained from self-reported data. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of CVD risk factors varied by Hispanic/Latino background; obesity and current smoking rates were highest among Puerto Rican participants (for men, 40.9% and 34.7%; for women, 51.4% and 31.7%, respectively); hypercholesterolemia prevalence was highest among Central American men (54.9%) and Puerto Rican women (41.0%). Large proportions of participants (80% of men, 71% of women) had at least 1 risk factor. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of 3 or more risk factors was highest in Puerto Rican participants (25.0%) and significantly higher (P < .001) among participants with less education (16.1%), those who were US-born (18.5%), those who had lived in the United States 10 years or longer (15.7%), and those who preferred English (17.9%). Overall, self-reported CHD and stroke prevalence were low (4.2% and 2.0% in men; 2.4% and 1.2% in women, respectively). In multivariate-adjusted models, hypertension and smoking were directly associated with CHD in both sexes as were hypercholesterolemia and obesity in women and diabetes in men (odds ratios [ORs], 1.5-2.2). For stroke, associations were positive with hypertension in both sexes, diabetes in men, and smoking in women (ORs, 1.7-2.6). CONCLUSION: Among US Hispanic/Latino adults of diverse backgrounds, a sizeable proportion of men and women had adverse major risk factors; prevalence of adverse CVD risk profiles was higher among participants with Puerto Rican background, lower SES, and higher levels of acculturation.",,,3,,,
2590,"Barriers to health service access among female migrant Ugandan sex workers in Guangzhou, China BACKGROUND: Increased trade between China and Uganda has fueled trafficking of female Ugandans into China. These women may face challenges accessing health services. This study focused on examining barriers to health care access among female Ugandan sex workers in China. METHODS: In 2014, we undertook in-depth interviews with 19 female Ugandan sex workers in Guangzhou, China. Interviews focused on barriers to health service access and were analyzed using an a priori coding framework followed by open-coding to capture emergent themes. RESULTS: Out of 19 women, 12 women reported a history of being trafficked into China. None of the women had a valid Chinese visa. Fear of being arrested for lack of documentation discouraged women in this sample from accessing hospital services. Low pay, housing exploitation, and remittances contributed to participants' lack of financial resources, which further inhibited their ability to access health services. Participants expressed feeling social isolation from the local community and reported mistrust of local individuals and organizations, including hospitals. CONCLUSION: Ugandan sex workers in China faced substantial structural barriers that limited health service access. Policy changes and the development of new programs are urgently needed to ensure these women have improved access to health services.",,,6,,,
2591,"Leukemia: an overview for primary care Leukemia is a clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. The four broad subtypes most likely to be encountered by primary care physicians are acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous, chronic lymphocytic, and chronic myelogenous. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurs more often in children, whereas the other subtypes are more common in adults. Risk factors include a genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors, such as exposure to ionizing radiation. Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, bruising, or bleeding. A complete blood count usually reveals leukocytosis and other abnormally elevated or depressed cell lines. Patients with suspected leukemia should be referred promptly to a hematologist-oncologist. The diagnosis is confirmed by further examination of the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation, monoclonal antibodies, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Complications of treatment include tumor lysis syndrome and serious infections from immunosuppression. Leukemia survivors should be monitored closely for secondary malignancies, cardiac complications, and endocrine disturbances such as metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism. Five-year survival rates are highest in younger patients and in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",,,5,,,
2592,"""Oh, I'm Not Alone"": Experiences of HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex With Men in a Health Navigation Program to Promote Timely Linkage to Care in Guatemala City Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV in Guatemala and may benefit from health navigation programs designed to support timely linkage to HIV care. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with MSM (n = 19) linked to care within days of their diagnosis with the support of a health navigator. We used narrative analysis and systematic coding to identify themes related to HIV diagnosis and experiences with navigators. Participants experienced strong feelings of fear upon receiving a positive HIV test result. This fear led to social isolation and limited reliance on family and friend networks for support. Health navigators developed strong relationships with participants by providing the emotional support they were lacking and supporting them to overcome their fear and other structural barriers to HIV care, including stigma. Findings support the important role of navigation for MSM in Guatemala and could be transferable to other settings in Latin America.",,,6,,,
2593,"Intimate partner violence victimization and mental health among men who have sex with men living with HIV in guatemala Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by poor mental health compared to their heterosexual counterparts. One factor that may increase mental health problems among MSM is intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization. The objectives of this study are to (a) describe the prevalence of different forms of IPV victimization experienced by MSM living with HIV in Guatemala City and (b) examine the relationship between IPV victimization and mental health. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from a cohort of MSM living with HIV in Guatemala City (n_=_374) to describe the burden of IPV, including physical, sexual, and emotional IPV. We then examined relationships between lifetime IPV and each form of recent IPV (past 12 months) with self-reported anxiety and depression using multivariable logistic regression. Over a quarter (27.3%) of the participants screened positive for anxiety and nearly one fifth (17.9%) screened positive for depression. Over a quarter of the participants (28.6%) reported ever having experienced any IPV victimization and 8.8% reported having experienced any form of recent IPV. In multivariable analyses, participants who experienced any form of lifetime IPV had roughly twice the odds of experiencing anxiety (OR: 1.86; 95% CI_=__1.03, 3.38]) and depression (OR: 2.02; 95% CI_=__1.02, 3.99]) compared to those who had not. Participants who experienced recent emotional IPV had over seven times the odds of experiencing anxiety (OR: 7.23; 95% CI_=__1.46, 38.85]) compared to those who had not. MSM living with HIV in Guatemala experience a high burden of anxiety, depression, and IPV victimization. Those participants who had experienced lifetime IPV and recent emotional IPV were significantly more likely to screen for anxiety and depression. To improve their mental health, HIV clinics and other health services should provide support for MSM who have experienced IPV victimization.",,,2,,,

2595,"Association of infant feeding and dietary intake on obesity prevalence in low-income toddlers OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study assesses the independent and combined effects of breastfeeding (BF) and dietary intake, specifically sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), on obesity prevalence in low-income, primarily Hispanic toddlers. METHODS: The following data were collected in 2011 via phone surveys with caregivers of 2295 low-income children (2-4 years) from Los Angeles County Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs: infant feeding, dietary intake, gestational diabetes status, birth weight, gestational age, and mother's BMI. WIC staff measured children's height and weight. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regressions assessed the independent and combined effects of BF and dietary intake on obesity prevalence. RESULTS: Compared to no BF, BF _ 12 mos was associated with a 47% reduction in obesity prevalence (AOR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = 0.004). Compared to 2 + SSB/d, no SSB/d intake was associated with a 28% reduction in obesity prevalence (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.5-1.0, P = 0.03). High intake of soda, diet soda, and fruit drinks were linked to increases in obesity prevalence. There was no effect of 100% juice, milk (plain or flavored) fruit, vegetable, fast food, or sweetened grain intake on obesity prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support encouragement of BF _ 12 mos and no SSB intake to prevent obesity in low-income, primarily Hispanic, toddlers. Copyright _ 2013 The Obesity Society.",,,4,,,
2596,"Dietary variables associated with substantial postpartum weight retention at 1-year among women with GDM pregnancy BACKGROUND: An understanding of the dietary behaviors linked to substantial postpartum weight retention, particularly in women diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM), is warranted to focus intervention efforts to prevent future type 2 diabetes. This study evaluates the relationship between dietary food intake at 6-9_weeks postpartum (baseline) and odds of substantial postpartum weight retention (_ 5_kg) at 1-year in women with GDM. METHODS: The Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM pregnancy (SWIFT) is a prospective multi-ethnic cohort (75% minority) of 1035 women (aged 20-45_years) with recent GDM who delivered a singleton, live birth (_35_weeks gestation) and underwent 2-h 75_g OGTTs, anthropometric measurements and other assessments at 6-9_weeks postpartum (baseline) and annually thereafter. Eight hundred and eighty-eight women without diabetes at baseline completed the 18-item PrimeScreen to assess dietary intake and the 13-item Caffeine Survey to assess beverage intake, and completed 1-year follow-up. Average postpartum weight retention was calculated (1-year postpartum weight minus pre-pregnancy weight). Multivariable logistic regression models that estimated baseline dietary intake and odds of substantial postpartum weight retention (SPPWR _5_kg above pre-pregnancy weight) versus not SPPWR adjusted for numerous clinical, sociodemographic and behavioral covariates. RESULTS: Compared to eating no fried foods, women who reported eating fried foods _5 servings/wk. (n_=_32) and 2-4 serv/wk. (n_=_208), respectively, had a three-fold and two-fold higher odds of SPPWR (OR_=_3.38, 95% CI:1.36-8.38, P_=_0.009; OR_=_1.99, 95% CI:1.30-3.03, P_=_0.02), after adjustment for covariates and other foods and soda intake. Soda intake _2 serv/wk. versus none was associated with higher odds of SPPWR (OR_=_1.95, 95% CI:1.22-3.11, P_=_0.005) adjusted for fried foods and covariates, but was attenuated (OR_=_1.61,95% CI:0.98-2.66, p_=_0.06) after addition of whole eggs and processed meats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that interventions should focus on reducing fried foods and soda intake during early postpartum periods to reduce substantial postpartum weight retention in high-risk women with GDM.

2597,"Racial differences in weight loss among adults in a behavioral weight loss intervention: role of diet and physical activity BACKGROUND: African-Americans lose less weight during a behavioral intervention compared with Whites, which may be from differences in dietary intake or physical activity. METHODS: Subjects (30% African American, 70% White; n = 346; 42.4 _ 9.0 yrs.; BMI = 33.0 _ 3.7 kg/m2) in an 18-month weight loss intervention were randomized to a standard behavioral (SBWI) or a stepped-care (STEP) intervention. Weight, dietary intake, self-report and objective physical activity, and fitness were assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULTS: Weight loss at 18 months was greater in Whites (-8.74 kg with 95% CI [-10.10, -7.35]) compared with African Americans (-5.62 kg with 95% CI [-7.86, -3.37]) (P = .03) in the SBWI group and the STEP group (White: -7.48 kg with 95% CI [-8.80, -6.17] vs. African American: -4.41kg with 95% CI [-6.41, -2.42]) (P = .01). Patterns of change in dietary intake were not different between groups. Objective physical activity (PA) changed over time (P < .0001) and was higher in Whites when compared with African Americans (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Whites lost more weight (3.10 kg) than African American adults. Although there were no differences in dietary intake, Whites had higher levels of objective PA and fitness. Thus, the discrepancy in weight loss may be due to differences in PA rather than dietary intake. However, the precise role of these factors warrants further investigation.",,,4,,,
2598,"A systematic review of clinic and community intervention to increase fecal testing for colorectal cancer in rural and low-income populations in the United States - How, what and when? BACKGROUND: Interventions to improve fecal testing for colorectal cancer (CRC) exist, but are not yet routine practice. We conducted this systematic review to determine how implementation strategies and contextual factors influenced the uptake of interventions to increase Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) and Fecal Occult Blood Testing (FOBT) for CRC in rural and low-income populations in the United States. METHODS: We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library from January 1998 through July 2016, and Scopus and clinicaltrials.gov through March 2015, for original articles of interventions to increase fecal testing for CRC. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, extracted data and performed quality assessments. A qualitative synthesis described the relationship between changes in fecal testing rates for CRC, intervention components, implementation strategies, and contextual factors. A technical expert panel of primary care professionals, health system leaders, and academicians guided this work. RESULTS: Of 4218 citations initially identified, 27 unique studies reported in 29 publications met inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in primary care (n_=_20, 74.1%), community (n_=_5, 18.5%), or both (n_=_2, 7.4%) settings. All studies (n_=_27, 100.0%) described multicomponent interventions. In clinic based studies, components that occurred most frequently among the highly effective/effective study arms were provision of kits by direct mail, use of a pre-addressed stamped envelope, client reminders, and provider ordered in-clinic distribution. Interventions were delivered by clinic staff/community members (n_=_10, 37.0%), research staff (n_=_6, 22.2%), both (n_=_10, 37.0%), or it was unclear (n_=_1, 3.7%). Over half of the studies lacked information on training or monitoring intervention fidelity (n_=_15, 55.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Studies to improve FIT/FOBT in rural and low-income populations utilized multicomponent interventions. The provision of kits through the mail, use of pre-addressed stamped envelopes, client reminders and in-clinic distribution appeared most frequently in the highly effective/effective clinic-based study arms. Few studies described contextual factors or implementation strategies. More robust application of guidelines to support reporting on methods to select, adapt and implement interventions can help end users determine not just which interventions work to improve CRC screening, but which interventions would work best in their setting given specific patient populations, clinical settings, and community characteristics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, our systematic review protocol was registered with PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews, on April 16, 2015 (registration number CRD42015019557 ).",,,7,,,
2599,"Key collaborative factors when medicaid accountable care organizations work with primary care clinics to improve colorectal cancer screening: relationships, data, and quality improvement infrastructure PURPOSE: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are implementing interventions to achieve triple-aim objectives of improved quality and experience of care while maintaining costs. Partnering across organizational boundaries is perceived as critical to ACO success. METHODS: We conducted a comparative case study of 14 Medicaid ACOs in Oregon and their contracted primary care clinics using public performance data, key informant interviews, and consultation field notes. We focused on how ACOs work with clinics to improve colorectal cancer (CRC) screening - one incentivized performance metric. RESULTS: ACOs implemented a broad spectrum of multi-component interventions designed to increase CRC screening. The most common interventions focused on reducing structural barriers (n = 12 ACOs), delivering provider assessment and feedback (n = 11), and providing patient reminders (n = 7). ACOs developed their processes and infrastructure for working with clinics over time. Facilitators of successful collaboration included a history of and commitment to collaboration (partnership); the ability to provide accurate data to prioritize action and monitor improvement (performance data), and supporting clinics' reflective learning through facilitation, learning collaboratives; and support of ACO as well as clinic-based staffing (quality improvement infrastructure). Two unintended consequences of ACO-clinic partnership emerged: potential exclusion of smaller clinics and metric focus and fatigue. CONCLUSION: Our findings identified partnership, performance data, and quality improvement infrastructure as critical dimensions when Medicaid ACOs work with primary care to improve CRC screening. Findings may extend to other metric targets.",,,2,,,
2600,"Mailed FIT (fecal immunochemical test), navigation or patient reminders? Using microsimulation to inform selection of interventions to increase colorectal cancer screening in Medicaid enrollees Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be effectively prevented or detected with guideline concordant screening, yet Medicaid enrollees experience disparities. We used microsimulation to project CRC screening patterns, CRC cases averted, and life-years gained in the population of 68,077 Oregon Medicaid enrollees 50-64 over a five year period starting in January 2019. The simulation estimated the cost-effectiveness of five intervention scenarios - academic detailing plus provider audit and feedback (Detailing+), patient reminders (Reminders), mailing a Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) directly to the patient's home (Mailed FIT), patient navigation (Navigation), and mailed FIT with Navigation (Mailed FIT_+__avigation) - compared to usual care. Each intervention scenario raised CRC screening rates compared to usual care, with improvements as high as 11.6 percentage points (Mailed FIT_+__avigation) and as low as 2.5 percentage points (Reminders) after one year. Compared to usual care, Mailed FIT_+__avigation would raise CRC screening rates 20.2 percentage points after five years - averting nearly 77 cancer cases (a reduction of 113 per 100,000) and exceeding national screening targets. Over a five year period, Reminders, Mailed FIT and Mailed FIT_+__avigation were expected to be cost effective if stakeholders were willing to pay $230 or less per additional year up-to-date (at a cost of $22, $59, and $227 respectively), whereas Detailing+ and Navigation were more costly for the same benefits. To approach national CRC screening targets, health system stakeholders are encouraged to implement Mailed FIT with or without Navigation and Reminders. Copyright _ 2019 Elsevier Inc.

2601,"Geographic and population-level disparities in colorectal cancer testing: A multilevel analysis of Medicaid and commercial claims data Morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) can be attenuated through guideline concordant screening and intervention. This study used Medicaid and commercial claims data to examine individual and geographic factors associated with CRC testing rates in one state (Oregon). A total of 64,711 beneficiaries (4516 Medicaid; 60,195 Commercial) became newly age-eligible for CRC screening and met inclusion criteria (e.g., continuously enrolled, no prior history) during the study period (January 2010-December 2013). We estimated multilevel models to examine predictors for CRC testing, including individual (e.g., gender, insurance, rurality, access to care, distance to endoscopy facility) and geographic factors at the county level (e.g., poverty, uninsurance). Despite insurance coverage, only two out of five (42%) beneficiaries had evidence of CRC testing during the four year study window. CRC testing varied from 22.4% to 46.8% across Oregon's 36 counties; counties with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation had lower levels of testing. After controlling for age, beneficiaries had greater odds of receiving CRC testing if they were female (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08), commercially insured, or urban residents (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.21). Accessing primary care (OR 2.47, 95% CI 2.37-2.57), but not distance to endoscopy (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92-1.03) was associated with testing. CRC testing in newly age-eligible Medicaid and commercial members remains markedly low. Disparities exist by gender, geographic residence, insurance coverage, and access to primary care. Work remains to increase CRC testing to acceptable levels, and to select and implement interventions targeting the counties and populations in greatest need. Copyright _ 2017 Elsevier Inc.

2602,"Does a transition to accountable care in Medicaid shift the modality of colorectal cancer testing? BACKGROUND: Health care reform is changing preventive services delivery. This study explored trajectories in colorectal cancer (CRC) testing over a 5-year period that included implementation of 16 Medicaid Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs, 2012) and Medicaid expansion (2014) - two provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - within the state of Oregon, USA. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of Oregon's Medicaid claims for enrollee's eligible for CRC screening (50-64__ears) spanning January 2010 through December 2014. Our analysis was conducted and refined April 2016 through June 2018. The analysis assessed the annual probability of patients receiving CRC testing and the modality used (e.g., colonoscopy, fecal testing) relative to a baseline year (2010). We hypothesized that CRC testing would increase following Medicaid ACO formation - called Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). RESULTS: A total of 132,424 unique Medicaid enrollees (representing 255,192 person-years) met inclusion criteria over the 5-year study. Controlling for demographic and regional factors, the predicted probability of CRC testing was significantly higher in 2014 (+_1.4 percentage points, p_< _0.001) compared to the 2010 baseline but not in 2012 or 2013. Increased fecal testing using Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBT) or Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) played a prominent role in 2014. The uptick in statewide fecal testing appears driven primarily by a subset of CCOs. CONCLUSIONS: Observed CRC testing did not immediately increase following the transition to CCOs in 2012. However increased testing in 2014, may reflect a delay in implementation of interventions to increase CRC screening and/or a strong desire by newly insured Medicaid CCO members to receive preventive care.",,,7,,,
2603,"Declining trends in local health department preparedness capacities OBJECTIVES: We examined local health department (LHD) preparedness capacities in the context of participation in accreditation and other performance improvement efforts. MetHODS: We analyzed preparedness in 8 domains among LHDs responding to a preparedness capacity instrument from 2010 through 2012. Study groups included LHDs that (1) were exposed to a North Carolina state-based accreditation program, (2) participated in 1 or more performance improvement programs, and (3) had not participated in any performance improvement programs. We analyzed mean domain preparedness scores and applied a series of nonparametric Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon tests to determine whether preparedness domain scores differed significantly between study groups from 2010 to 2012. RESULTS: Preparedness capacity scores fluctuated and decreased significantly for all study groups for 2 domains: surveillance and investigation and legal preparedness. Significant decreases also occurred among participants for plans and protocols, communication, and incident command. Declines in capacity scores were not as great and less likely to be significant among North Carolina LHDs. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in preparedness capacities over the 3 survey years may reflect multiple years of funding cuts and job losses, specifically for preparedness. An accreditation program may have a protective effect against such contextual factors.",,,1,,,
2604,"Effects of performance improvement programs on preparedness capacities OBJECTIVE: In response to public health systems and services research priorities, we examined the extent to which participation in accreditation and performance improvement programs can be expected to enhance preparedness capacities. METHODS: Using data collected by the Local Health Department Preparedness Capacities Assessment Survey, we applied a series of weighted least-squares models to examine the effect of program participation on each of the eight preparedness domain scores. Participation was differentiated across four groups: North Carolina (NC) accredited local health departments (LHDs), NC non-accredited LHDs, national comparison LHDs that participated in performance or preparedness programs, and national comparison LHDs that did not participate in any program. RESULTS: Domain scores varied among the four groups. Statistically significant positive participation effects were observed on six of eight preparedness domains for NC accreditation programs, on seven domains for national comparison group LHDs that participated in performance programs, and on four domains for NC non-accredited LHDs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, accreditation and other performance improvement programs have a significant and positive effect on preparedness capacities. While we found no differences among accredited and non-accredited NC LHDs, this lack of significant difference in preparedness scores among NC LHDs is attributed to NC's robust statewide preparedness program, as well as a likely exposure effect among non-accredited NC LHDs to the accreditation program.",,,1,,,

2606,"Predictors of sustained reduction in energy and fat intake in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study intensive lifestyle intervention BACKGROUND: Few lifestyle intervention studies examine long-term sustainability of dietary changes. OBJECTIVE: To describe sustainability of dietary changes over 9 years in the Diabetes Prevention Program and its outcomes study, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, among participants receiving the intensive lifestyle intervention. DESIGN: One thousand seventy-nine participants were enrolled in the intensive lifestyle intervention arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program; 910 continued participation in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study. Fat and energy intake derived from food frequency questionnaires at baseline and post-randomization Years 1 and 9 were examined. Parsimonious models determined whether baseline characteristics and intensive lifestyle intervention session participation predicted sustainability. RESULTS: Self-reported energy intake was reduced from a median of 1,876 kcal/day (interquartile range [IQR]=1,452 to 2,549 kcal/day) at baseline to 1,520 kcal/day (IQR=1,192 to 1,986 kcal/day) at Year 1, and 1,560 kcal/day (IQR=1,223 to 2,026 kcal/day) at Year 9. Dietary fat was reduced from a median of 70.4 g (IQR=49.3 to 102.5 g) to 45 g (IQR=32.2 to 63.8 g) at Year 1 and increased to 61.0 g (IQR=44.6 to 82.7 g) at Year 9. Percent energy from fat was reduced from a median of 34.4% (IQR=29.6% to 38.5%) to 27.1% (IQR=23.1% to 31.5%) at Year 1 but increased to 35.3% (IQR=29.7% to 40.2%) at Year 9. Lower baseline energy intake and Year 1 dietary reduction predicted lower energy and fat gram intake at Year 9. Higher leisure physical activity predicted lower fat gram intake but not energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive lifestyle intervention can result in reductions in total energy intake for up to 9 years. Initial success in achieving reductions in fat and energy intake and success in attaining activity goals appear to predict long-term success at maintaining changes.

2607,"Impact of daily cotrimoxazole on clinical malaria and asymptomatic parasitemias in HIV-exposed, uninfected infants BACKGROUND: Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) is recommended for all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed infants to avoid opportunistic infections. Cotrimoxazole has antimalarial effects and appears to reduce clinical malaria infections, but the impact on asymptomatic malaria infections is unknown. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study using data and dried blood spots (DBSs) from the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals and Nutrition study to evaluate the impact of CPT on malaria infection during peak malaria season in Lilongwe, Malawi. We compared malaria incidence 1 year before and after CPT implementation (292 and 682 CPT-unexposed and CPT-exposed infants, respectively), including only infants who remained HIV negative by 36 weeks of age. Malaria was defined as clinical, asymptomatic (using DBSs at 12, 24, and 36 weeks), or a composite outcome of clinical or asymptomatic. Linear and binomial regression with generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the association between CPT and malaria. Differences in characteristics of parasitemias and drug resistance polymorphisms by CPT status were also assessed in the asymptomatic infections. RESULTS: CPT was associated with a 70% (95% confidence interval, 53%-81%) relative reduction in the risk of asymptomatic infection between 6 and 36 weeks of age. CPT appeared to provide temporary protection against clinical malaria and more sustained protection against asymptomatic infections, with no difference in parasitemia characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: CPT appears to reduce overall malaria infections, with more prolonged impacts on asymptomatic infections. Asymptomatic infections are potentially important reservoirs for malaria transmission. Therefore, CPT prophylaxis may have important individual and public health benefits. _ The Author 2015.

2608,"Antiretroviral drug concentrations in breastmilk, maternal HIV viral load, and HIV transmission to the infant: results from the BAN study BACKGROUND: Concentration of antiretroviral (ARV) drug found in plasma, and amounts of drug excreted into breastmilk, may affect HIV viral load and potentially perinatal HIV transmission. METHODS: In this cohort study with 2-phase sampling, we included mothers randomized to postpartum maternal ARVs or daily infant nevirapine during 28 weeks of breastfeeding in the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition study. Among these, we included all mothers who transmitted HIV to their infants between 2 and 28 weeks and 15% of mothers who did not (n = 27 and 227, respectively). Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were used to assess the correlation between maternal plasma and breastmilk ARV concentration. Associations between the median effective drug concentration (EC50) and detectable maternal viral load (plasma: >40 copies per milliliter, breastmilk: >56 copies per milliliter) were assessed using mixed-effects models. Cox models were used to estimate the association between maternal or infant plasma drug concentration and breastmilk HIV transmission from 2 to 28 weeks. RESULTS: All ARV compounds exhibited substantial correlations between maternal plasma and breastmilk concentrations (r: 0.85-0.98, P-value < 0.0001). Having plasma drug concentration above the EC50 was associated with lower odds of having detectable HIV RNA [maternal plasma odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45 to 0.91; breastmilk OR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.35] and a reduced rate of breastmilk HIV transmission (hazard ratio 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.93). Having breastmilk drug concentration above the EC50 was also associated with lower odds of having detectable maternal HIV RNA (plasma OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.85; breastmilk OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring adequate drug concentration is important for viral suppression and preventing breastmilk HIV transmission.",,,6,,,
2609,"TeleHealth improves diabetes self-management in an underserved community: diabetes TeleCare OBJECTIVE: To conduct a 1-year randomized clinical trial to evaluate a remote comprehensive diabetes self-management education (DSME) intervention, Diabetes TeleCare, administered by a dietitian and nurse/certified diabetes educator (CDE) in the setting of a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in rural South Carolina. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were recruited from three member health centers of an FQHC and were randomized to either Diabetes TeleCare, a 12-month, 13-session curriculum delivered using telehealth strategies, or usual care. RESULTS: Mixed linear regression model results for repeated measures showed a significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (GHb) in the Diabetes TeleCare group from baseline to 6 and 12 months (9.4 +/- 0.3, 8.3 +/- 0.3, and 8.2 +/- 0.4, respectively) compared with usual care (8.8 +/- 0.3, 8.6 +/- 0.3, and 8.6 +/- 0.3, respectively). LDL cholesterol was reduced at 12 months in the Diabetes TeleCare group compared with usual care. Although not part of the original study design, GHb was reduced from baseline to 12 and 24 months in the Diabetes TeleCare group (9.2 +/- 0.4, 7.4 +/- 0.5, and 7.6 +/- 0.5, respectively) compared with usual care (8.7 +/- 0.4, 8.1 +/- 0.4, and 8.1 +/- 0.5, respectively) in a post hoc analysis of a subset of the randomized sample who completed a 24-month follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth effectively created access to successfully conduct a 1-year remote DSME by a nurse CDE and dietitian that improved metabolic control and reduced cardiovascular risk in an ethnically diverse and rural population.",,,4,,,
2610,"Increased persistence of initial treatment for HIV infection with modern antiretroviral therapy BACKGROUND: Initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) early improves clinical outcomes and prevents transmission. Guidelines for first-line therapy have changed with the availability of newer ART agents. In this study, we compared persistence and virologic responses with initial ART according to the class of anchor agent used. SETTING: An observational clinical cohort study in the Southeastern United States. METHODS: All HIV-infected patients participating in the UNC Center for AIDS Research Clinical Cohort (UCHCC) and initiating ART between 1996 and 2014 were included. Separate time-to-event analyses with regimen discontinuation and virologic failure as outcomes were used, including Kaplan-Meier survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: One thousand six hundred twenty-four patients were included (median age of 37 years at baseline, 28% women, 60% African American, and 28% white). Eleven percent initiated integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), 33% non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), 20% boosted protease inhibitor, 27% other, and 9% NRTI only regimens. Compared with NNRTI-containing regimens, INSTI-containing regimens had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.69) for discontinuation and 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.06) for virologic failure. All other regimen types were associated with increased rates of discontinuation and failure compared with NNRTI. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating ART with an INSTI-containing regimen was associated with lower rates of regimen discontinuation and virologic failure.",,,5,,,
2611,"Acute HIV infection and CD4/CD8 ratio normalization after antiretroviral therapy initiation BACKGROUND: We estimated the effect of initiating virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute HIV infection versus chronic HIV infection (AHI vs. CHI) on CD4/CD8 ratio normalization. SETTING: A prospective clinical cohort study. METHODS: We included patients initiating ART with AHI and CHI between 2000 and 2015 and compared time from ART initiation to the first normal CD4/CD8 ratio (defined as CD4/CD8 _1) using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Patient time was censored at virologic failure, lost to follow-up, or death. We also characterized CD4, CD8, and CD4/CD8 trajectories over the first 3 years of ART. RESULTS: The 1198 patients were 27% female and 60% African American, with a median age of 37 years (interquartile range 28-47) at ART initiation. The 83 AHI patients were more likely male, younger, and of white race, than CHI patients. After 2 years of suppressive ART, 70% of AHI patients achieved a normal CD4/CD8 ratio, compared to 6%-38% of CHI patients, with greater likelihood of normalization at higher baseline CD4 counts. Time to normalization was shortest among AHI patients, followed by CHI patients with higher baseline CD4. The adjusted hazard ratio for time to normalization for AHI patients compared to CHI patients with baseline CD4 >350 was 4.33 (95% CI: 3.16 to 5.93). Higher baseline CD4/CD8 ratio was also associated with time to normalization (adjusted hazard ratio 1.54; 1.46, 1.63, per 0.1 increase in ratio). CONCLUSIONS: Initiating ART during AHI at higher baseline CD4 cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios was associated with shorter time to CD4/CD8 ratio normalization.",,,5,,,
2612,"Effectiveness of integrase strand transfer inhibitors among treatment-experienced patients in a clinical setting OBJECTIVE: Characterize virologic and immunologic outcomes of INSTI-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) in experienced patients with and without virologic failure. DESIGN: Prospective clinical cohort. METHODS: ART-experienced, INSTI-naive participants in the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV Clinical Cohort (UCHCC) initiating an INSTI-containing regimen 2007-2016 were followed from INSTI initiation (baseline) to the earliest of: outcome of interest, loss to follow-up (LTFU, 1 year without clinical visit), or death. Outcomes of interest were virologic failure (first of two consecutive viral loads at least 200__opies/ml more than 2 weeks apart, or one viral load _200 before LTFU) and immune recovery (first CD4 _500__ells/_l). Patients with baseline viral load at least 50 copies/ml were given 24 weeks before meeting virologic failure criteria. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models compared INSTI regimens and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of 773 patients, 32% were women, 59% African-American, and 42% had a viral load at least 50 copies/ml at INSTI initiation. After 2 years, 5% of patients with baseline viral load less than 50 copies/ml experienced virologic failure, compared with 35% of patients with baseline viral load at least 50 copies/ml (P_< _0.01). Among patients with baseline viral load less than 50 copies/ml, dolutegravir/NRTIs was associated with longer time to virologic failure [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.80], whereas among patients with baseline viral load at least 50 copies/ml, raltegravir/NRTIs was associated with longer time to virologic failure (aHR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.68), both compared with elvitegravir/NRTIs. After 5 years suppressed, irrespective of baseline viral load, 61% of patients experienced immune recovery. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, INSTI-containing regimens led to low virologic failure rates in patients switching ART while suppressed. Viremic patients initiating INSTIs were at high risk of virologic failure during follow-up.",,,5,,,
2613,"The interactive effect of neighborhood peer cigarette use and 5HTTLPR genotype on individual cigarette use BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional research has shown that adolescents' cigarette use is interactively associated with that of their school peers and their 5HTTLPR genotype, such that the cigarette use of persons with more copies of the 5HTTLPR*S' allele is more dependent on school peers' cigarette use behaviors than their counterparts. This analysis seeks to extend this novel finding by examining whether the same conclusion can be reached when substituting neighborhood peers for school peers and examining the timing of the initiation of any and regular smoking in adolescence. METHODS: This analysis employs an independent sample with longitudinal measures of cigarette use among 6th through 8th graders clustered in 82 neighborhoods, of whom 1098 contributed genetic data. The proportion of respondents who had ever smoked cigarettes by the first wave was calculated for each census block group in the study. 5HTTLPR genotype was assayed using the method of Whisman et al. (2011). The timing of any or regular smoking initiation and over four years were modeled as dependent variables using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The interaction of neighborhood peer smoking behavior in the first wave and 5HTTLPR genotype statistically significantly predicted any smoking initiation (hazard ratio: 3.532; p-value=0.002) and regular smoking initiation (hazard ratio: 5.686; p-value=0.000), net of controls for sex, race/ethnicity, grade in the first wave of data, and parental educational attainment. These findings reach the same conclusions as previous cross-sectional research. CONCLUSIONS: These results differ in the model of gene-environment interaction that they support. The findings for any smoking initiation are consistent with the diathesis-stress model of gene-environment interaction; the findings for regular smoking initiation are consistent with the differential susceptibility model.

2614,"Large-scale genomic analyses link reproductive aging to hypothalamic signaling, breast cancer susceptibility and BRCA1-mediated DNA repair Menopause timing has a substantial impact on infertility and risk of disease, including breast cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We report a dual strategy in _70,000 women to identify common and low-frequency protein-coding variation associated with age at natural menopause (ANM). We identified 44 regions with common variants, including two regions harboring additional rare missense alleles of large effect. We found enrichment of signals in or near genes involved in delayed puberty, highlighting the first molecular links between the onset and end of reproductive lifespan. Pathway analyses identified major association with DNA damage response (DDR) genes, including the first common coding variant in BRCA1 associated with any complex trait. Mendelian randomization analyses supported a causal effect of later ANM on breast cancer risk (_6% increase in risk per year; P = 3 _ 10(-14)), likely mediated by prolonged sex hormone exposure rather than DDR mechanisms.",,,3,,,

Using 1000 Genomes Project-imputed genotype data in up to _370,000 women, we identify 389 independent signals (P < 5 _ 10-8) for age at menarche, a milestone in female pubertal development. In Icelandic data, these signals explain _7.4% of the population variance in age at menarche, corresponding to _25% of the estimated heritability. We implicate _250 genes via coding variation or associated expression, demonstrating significant enrichment in neural tissues. Rare variants near the imprinted genes MKRN3 and DLK1 were identified, exhibiting large effects when paternally inherited. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest causal inverse associations, independent of body mass index (BMI), between puberty timing and risks for breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. In aggregate, our findings highlight the complexity of the genetic regulation of puberty timing and support causal links with cancer susceptibility.",,,3,,,
2617,"Expanding community engagement in HIV clinical trials: a pilot study using crowdsourcing OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential for crowdsourcing to complement and extend community advisory board (CAB) feedback on HIV clinical trials. Crowdsourcing involves community members attempting to solve a problem and then sharing solutions. METHODS: CAB and crowdsourced approaches were implemented in the context of a phase 1 HIV antibody trial to collect feedback on informed consent, participation experiences, and fairness. CAB engagement was conducted through group discussions with members of an HIV CAB. Crowdsourcing involved open events intended to engage the local community, including interactive video modules, animated vignettes, and a creative idea contest. Open coding and analysis of emergent themes were conducted to compare CAB and crowdsourced feedback. RESULTS: The crowdsourcing activities engaged 61 people across three events; nine people engaged in CAB feedback. Compared with CAB participants, crowdsourcing participants had lower levels of education and income, and higher levels of disability and unemployment. Overlap in CAB and crowdsourced feedback included recommendations for enhancing communication and additional support for trial participants. Crowdsourcing provided more detailed feedback on the impact of positive experiences and socio-economic factors on trial participation. CAB feedback included greater emphasis on institutional regulations and tailoring trial procedures. Crowdsourced feedback emphasized alternative methods for learning about trials and concerns with potential risks of trial participation. CONCLUSION: Conducting crowdsourcing in addition to CAB engagement can yield a broader range of stakeholder feedback to inform the design and conduct of HIV clinical trials. VIDEO ABSTRACT:.",,,6,,,
2618,"Self-regulatory processes mediate the intention-behavior relation for adherence and exercise behaviors OBJECTIVES: Understanding the gap between people's intentions and actual health behavior is an important issue in health psychology. Our aim in this study was to investigate whether self-regulatory processes (monitoring goal progress and responding to discrepancies) mediate the intention-behavior relation in relation to HIV medication adherence (Study 1) and intensive exercise behavior (Study 2). METHOD: In Study 1, questionnaire and electronically monitored adherence data were collected at baseline and 3 months later from patients in the control arm of an HIV-adherence intervention study. In Study 2, questionnaire data was collected at 3 time points 6-weeks apart in a cohort study of physical activity. RESULTS: Complete data at all time points were obtained from 51 HIV-infected patients and 499 intensive exercise participants. Intentions were good predictors of behavior and explained 25 to 30% of the variance. Self-regulatory processes explained an additional 11% (Study 1) and 6% (Study 2) of variance in behavior on top of intentions. Regression and bootstrap analyses revealed at least partial, and possibly full, mediation of the intention-behavior relation by self-regulatory processes. CONCLUSIONS: The present studies indicate that self-regulatory processes may explain how intentions drive behavior. Future tests, using different health behaviors and experimental designs, could firmly establish whether self-regulatory processes complement current health behavior theories and should become routine targets for intervention.

2619,"The effect of a kindergarten-based, family-involved intervention on objectively measured physical activity in Belgian preschool boys and girls of high and low SES: the ToyBox-study BACKGROUND: The ToyBox-study developed an evidence- and theory-based intervention to improve preschoolers' energy balance-related behaviours - including physical activity (PA) - by targeting the kindergarten environment and involving their parents/caregivers. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the ToyBox-intervention on increasing Belgian preschoolers' objectively measured PA levels. METHODS: A sample of 472 preschoolers (4.43 _ 0.55 years; 55.1% boys) from 27 kindergartens (15 intervention, 12 control kindergartens) in Flanders, Belgium were included in the data analyses. Preschoolers wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for six consecutive days and were included in the data analyses if they had a minimum of two weekdays and one weekend day, both at baseline and follow-up (one year later). Preschoolers' PA outcomes were estimated for an average day, weekday, weekend day, during school hours, and during after school hours. To assess intervention effects, multilevel repeated measures analyses were conducted for the total sample, and for sub-groups (according to sex, kindergarten levels of socio-economic status (SES) and risk groups (low levels of PA at baseline)) of preschoolers. RESULTS: Small intervention effects were found in the total sample. Most intervention effects were found in boys and in preschoolers from high SES kindergartens. Boys from the intervention group had an increase in vigorous PA (_=1.47, p=0.03) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (_=1.27, p=0.03) from baseline to follow-up, whereas PA levels in boys from the control group stagnated or decreased. In preschoolers from high SES kindergartens, the largest effects were found for PA outcomes during school hours and during after school hours. CONCLUSION: The results from the Belgian sample demonstrate that effects of the PA-component of the ToyBox-intervention on objectively measured PA were found in preschool boys and in preschoolers from high SES kindergartens, which means that the ToyBox-intervention was mainly effective in those sub-groups. Future interventions should search for alternative strategies to increase preschoolers' PA levels in preschool girls and preschoolers from low SES kindergartens, as these are the most important at-risk groups regarding PA.",,,9,,,
2620,"Child marriage and associated outcomes in northern Ghana: a cross-sectional study BACKGROUND: Child marriage is a human rights violation disproportionately affecting girls in lower- and middle-income countries and has serious public health implications. In Ghana, one in five girls marry before their 18th birthday and one in 20 girls is married before her 15th birthday. This paper uses a unique dataset from Northern Ghana to examine the association between child marriage and adverse outcomes for women among a uniquely vulnerable population. METHODS: Baseline data from on ongoing impact evaluation of a government-run cash transfer programme was used. The sample consisted of 1349 ever-married women aged 20-29_years from 2497 households in the Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana. We estimated a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression models to examine associations of child marriage with health, fertility, contraception, child mortality, social support, stress and agency outcomes among women, controlling for individual characteristics and household-level factors. RESULTS: Child marriage in this sample was associated with increased odds of poorer health, as measured by difficulties in daily activities (OR_=_2.08; CI 1.28-3.38 among women 20-24_years and OR_=_1.58; CI 1.19-2.12 among women 20-29_years), increased odds of child mortality among first-born children (OR_=_2.03; CI_1.09-3.77 among women 20-24_years) and lower odds of believing that one's life is determined by their own actions (OR_=_0.42; CI 0.25-0.72 among women 20-24_years and OR_=_0.54; CI 0.39-0.75 among women 20-29_years). Conversely, child marriage was associated with lower levels of reported stress (regression coefficient_=_-_1.18; CI -1.84--0.51 among women 20-29_years). CONCLUSIONS: Child marriage is common in Northern Ghana and is associated with poor health, increased child mortality, and low agency among women in this sample of extremely poor households. While not much is known about effective measures to combat child marriage in the context of Ghana, programmes that address key drivers of early marriage such as economic insecurity and school enrolment at the secondary level, should be examined with respect to their effectiveness at reducing early marriage.

2621,"Editor's Highlight: High-Throughput Functional Genomics Identifies Modulators of TCE Metabolite Genotoxicity and Candidate Susceptibility Genes Trichloroethylene (TCE), an industrial chemical and environmental contaminant, is a human carcinogen. Reactive metabolites are implicated in renal carcinogenesis associated with TCE exposure, yet the toxicity mechanisms of these metabolites and their contribution to cancer and other adverse effects remain unclear. We employed an integrated functional genomics approach that combined functional profiling studies in yeast and avian DT40 cell models to provide new insights into the specific mechanisms contributing to toxicity associated with TCE metabolites. Genome-wide profiling studies in yeast identified the error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway as an import mechanism in response to TCE metabolites. The role of TLS DNA repair was further confirmed by functional profiling in DT40 avian cell lines, but also revealed that TLS and homologous recombination DNA repair likely play competing roles in cellular susceptibility to TCE metabolites in higher eukaryotes. These DNA repair pathways are highly conserved between yeast, DT40, and humans. We propose that in humans, mutagenic TLS is favored over homologous recombination repair in response to TCE metabolites. The results of these studies contribute to the body of evidence supporting a mutagenic mode of action for TCE-induced renal carcinogenesis mediated by reactive metabolites in humans. Our approach illustrates the potential for high-throughput in vitro functional profiling in yeast to elucidate toxicity pathways (molecular initiating events, key events) and candidate susceptibility genes for focused study. _ The Author 2017.

2622,"Gene-educational attainment interactions in a multi-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis identify novel blood pressure loci Educational attainment is widely used as a surrogate for socioeconomic status (SES). Low SES is a risk factor for hypertension and high blood pressure (BP). To identify novel BP loci, we performed multi-ancestry meta-analyses accounting for gene-educational attainment interactions using two variables, ""Some College"" (yes/no) and ""Graduated College"" (yes/no). Interactions were evaluated using both a 1 degree of freedom (DF) interaction term and a 2DF joint test of genetic and interaction effects. Analyses were performed for systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure. We pursued genome-wide interrogation in Stage 1 studies (N_=_117 438) and follow-up on promising variants in Stage 2 studies (N_=_293 787) in five ancestry groups. Through combined meta-analyses of Stages 1 and 2, we identified 84 known and 18 novel BP loci at genome-wide significance level (P_< _5___10-8). Two novel loci were identified based on the 1DF test of interaction with educational attainment, while the remaining 16 loci were identified through the 2DF joint test of genetic and interaction effects. Ten novel loci were identified in individuals of African ancestry. Several novel loci show strong biological plausibility since they involve physiologic systems implicated in BP regulation. They include genes involved in the central nervous system-adrenal signaling axis (ZDHHC17, CADPS, PIK3C2G), vascular structure and function (GNB3, CDON), and renal function (HAS2 and HAS2-AS1, SLIT3). Collectively, these findings suggest a role of educational attainment or SES in further dissection of the genetic architecture of BP.",,,8,,,
2623,"Genome-wide meta-analysis of variant-by-diuretic interactions as modulators of lipid traits in persons of European and African ancestry Hypertension (HTN) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Metabolic abnormalities, including adverse cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) profiles, are frequent comorbid findings with HTN and contribute to cardiovascular disease. Diuretics, which are used to treat HTN and heart failure, have been associated with worsening of fasting lipid concentrations. Genome-wide meta-analyses with 39,710 European-ancestry (EA) individuals and 9925 African-ancestry (AA) individuals were performed to identify genetic variants that modify the effect of loop or thiazide diuretic use on blood lipid concentrations. Both longitudinal and cross sectional data were used to compute cohort-specific interaction results, which were then combined through meta-analysis in each ancestry. These ancestry-specific results were further combined through trans-ancestry meta-analysis. Analysis of EA data identified two genome-wide significant (p_< _5___10-8) loci with single nucleotide variant (SNV)-loop diuretic interaction on TG concentrations (including COL11A1). Analysis of AA data identified one genome-wide significant locus adjacent to BMP2 with SNV-loop diuretic interaction on TG concentrations. Trans-ancestry analysis strengthened evidence of association for SNV-loop diuretic interaction at two loci (KIAA1217 and BAALC). There were few significant SNV-thiazide diuretic interaction associations on TG concentrations and for either diuretic on cholesterol concentrations. Several promising loci were identified that may implicate biologic pathways that contribute to adverse metabolic side effects from diuretic therapy.",,,8,,,
2624,"Growing partners: building a community-academic partnership to address health disparities in rural North Carolina BACKGROUND: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds tremendous promise for addressing public health disparities. As such, there is a need for academic institutions to build lasting partnerships with community organizations. Herein we have described the process of establishing a relationship between a research university and a Black church in rural North Carolina. We then discuss Harvest of Hope, the church-based pilot garden project that emerged from that partnership. METHODS: The partnership began with a third-party effort to connect research universities with Black churches to address health disparities. Building this academic-community partnership included collaborating to determine research questions and programming priorities. Other aspects of the partnership included applying for funding together and building consensus on study budget and aims. The academic partners were responsible for administrative details and the community partners led programming and were largely responsible for participant recruitment. RESULTS: The community and academic partners collaborated to design and implement Harvest of Hope, a church-based pilot garden project involving 44 youth and adults. Community and academic partners shared responsibility for study design, recruitment, programming, and reporting of results. The successful operation of the Harvest of Hope project gave rise to a larger National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, Faith, Farming and the Future (F3) involving 4 churches and 60 youth. Both projects were CBPR efforts to improve healthy food access and reducing chronic disease. This partnership continues to expand as we develop additional CBPR projects targeting physical activity, healthy eating, and environmental justice, among others. Benefits of the partnership include increased community ownership and cultural appropriateness of interventions. Challenges include managing expectations of diverse parties and adequate communication. Lessons learned and strategies for building and maintaining similar partnerships are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of community-based research for addressing health disparities are many, and there are lessons to be learned that can strengthen community-academic partnerships.",,,9,,,

2626,"Identifying gene-gene interactions that are highly associated with four quantitative lipid traits across multiple cohorts Genetic loci explain only 25-30_% of the heritability observed in plasma lipid traits. Epistasis, or gene-gene interactions may contribute to a portion of this missing heritability. Using the genetic data from five NHLBI cohorts of 24,837 individuals, we combined the use of the quantitative multifactor dimensionality reduction (QMDR) algorithm with two SNP-filtering methods to exhaustively search for SNP-SNP interactions that are associated with HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). SNPs were filtered either on the strength of their independent effects (main effect filter) or the prior knowledge supporting a given interaction (Biofilter). After the main effect filter, QMDR identified 20 SNP-SNP models associated with HDL-C, 6 associated with LDL-C, 3 associated with TC, and 10 associated with TG (permutation P value_< 0.05). With the use of Biofilter, we identified 2 SNP-SNP models associated with HDL-C, 3 associated with LDL-C, 1 associated with TC and 8 associated with TG (permutation P value_< 0.05). In an independent dataset of 7502 individuals from the eMERGE network, we replicated 14 of the interactions identified after main effect filtering: 11 for HDL-C, 1 for LDL-C and 2 for TG. We also replicated 23 of the interactions found to be associated with TG after applying Biofilter. Prior knowledge supports the possible role of these interactions in the genetic etiology of lipid traits. This study also presents a computationally efficient pipeline for analyzing data from large genotyping arrays and detecting SNP-SNP interactions that are not primarily driven by strong main effects.",,,1,,,
2627,"Indicated prevention of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in south africa: effectiveness of case management In the Western Cape Province of South Africa (ZA) a subculture of binge drinking produces the highest global documented prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD prevention research activities in ZA use the Comprehensive Prevention approach from the United States Institute of Medicine. Case management (CM) was delivered as a method of indicated prevention to empower heavy drinking pregnant women to achieve cessation or a reduction in drinking. CM activities incorporated life management, Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques and the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA). Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. Mean drinking decreases 6 months into CM; but overall alcohol consumption rose significantly over time to levels higher than baseline at 12 and 18 months. Alcohol consumption drops significantly from before pregnancy to the second and third trimesters. AUDIT scores indicate that problematic drinking decreases significantly even after the vulnerable fetus/baby was born. CM significantly increases client happiness, which correlates with reduced weekend drinking. CM was successful for women with high-risk drinking behaviour, and was effective in helping women stop drinking, or drink less, while pregnant, reducing the risk of FASD.",,,6,,,

We therefore incorporated gene-alcohol interactions into a multiancestry genome-wide association study of levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We included 45 studies in stage 1 (genome-wide discovery) and 66 studies in stage 2 (focused follow-up), for a total of 394,584 individuals from 5 ancestry groups. Analyses covered the period July 2014-November 2017. Genetic main effects and interaction effects were jointly assessed by means of a 2-degrees-of-freedom (df) test, and a 1-df test was used to assess the interaction effects alone. Variants at 495 loci were at least suggestively associated (P < 1 _ 10-6) with lipid levels in stage 1 and were evaluated in stage 2, followed by combined analyses of stage 1 and stage 2. In the combined analysis of stages 1 and 2, a total of 147 independent loci were associated with lipid levels at P < 5 _ 10-8 using 2-df tests, of which 18 were novel. No genome-wide-significant associations were found testing the interaction effect alone. The novel loci included several genes (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB), and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC1) complementation factor (A1CF)) that have a putative role in lipid metabolism on the basis of existing evidence from cellular and experimental models.

2629,"Adiponectin and leptin levels in migraineurs in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study OBJECTIVE: To evaluate adiponectin and leptin levels in older men and women with migraine. METHODS: Fasting total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and leptin levels were evaluated in a case-cohort study of nondiabetic older migraine and nonmigraine control participants from the ongoing, longitudinal, general population, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study at visit 1 (1987-1989). A standardized headache questionnaire was completed at visit 3 (1993-1995). Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, center, body mass index, and fasting glucose were used to evaluate the association of each adipocytokine with migraine. RESULTS: Of the 981 participants, the mean age at baseline was 52.8 years (SE 0.3); 131 fulfilled migraine criteria. Crude, mean total adiponectin levels were greater in men and women with migraine (8.1 _g/mL, SE 0.5) as compared to those without migraine (7.0 _g/mL, SE 0.2) (p = 0.031). After adjustments, the odds of migraine were increased by 88% with each SD increase in total adiponectin in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15, 3.01; p = 0.011), but not in women (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.80, 1.37; p = 0.728; p interaction = 0.029). Similar results were demonstrated for HMW adiponectin. Crude and adjusted leptin levels were not associated with migraine. CONCLUSIONS: Although crude, total adiponectin levels were higher in older men and women with migraine than controls, after adjustments, the prevalence of migraine was significantly associated with total adiponectin only in older men, suggesting the association may be confounded or absent in older women. Leptin was not associated with migraine in older men or women. _ 2014 American Academy of Neurology.",,,3,,,
2630,"Less traditional diets in Chinese mothers and children are similarly linked to socioeconomic and cohort factors but vary with increasing child age Global shifts toward an increasingly Western diet and rises in nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases necessitate systematic examination of dietary change in adults and children. This study longitudinally examined mother and child dietary intakes and their relationship with socioeconomic factors across 4 mutually exclusive cohorts followed over 6- to 7-y time periods (cohort A: 1991-1997, cohort B: 1993-2000, cohort C: 1997-2004, cohort D: 2000-2006). The cohorts included 966 mother-child pairs (children 3-5 y at baseline) from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-h recall and household food consumption data; dietary variables were the percentage of total energy from animal-source foods (ASF), fats/oils, and grains. Mother-child comparison of dietary variables used average annual change measures, Spearman partial correlations, random effects models, and seemingly unrelated regression models and estimation. Whereas children were earlier adopters and maintainers of a less traditional Chinese diet, mothers experienced greater shifts away from the traditional Chinese diet with increasing child age. Mother-child correlations for the dietary variables ranged from 0.46 to 0.89 (P < 0.001). Similar increased intake of ASF and decreased intake of grains were reported for mothers and children of urban (vs. rural) residence and with higher levels of maternal education (P < 0.001). A comparable cohort effect was shown, with mothers and children consuming a less traditional Chinese diet in the later (C and D) compared to earlier (A and B) cohorts (P < 0.05). Our findings provide insight into dietary changes in mothers and children within the context of a rapidly changing nutrition and socioeconomic environment.",,,4,,,
2631,"Longitudinal, cross-cohort comparison of physical activity patterns in Chinese mothers and children BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence comparing adult and child physical activity (PA) trends and examining parent-child PA associations within a newly industrialized country setting. PA research within a newly industrialized country setting is particularly important given the negative effects of rapid urbanization, socioeconomic growth, and technological advances on PA behaviors. The purpose of our study was to examine trends and associations in PA behaviors in Chinese mother-child pairs and to investigate relationships between PA behaviors and socioeconomic variables in this dyad. METHODS: We studied PA behaviors in 2 separate cohorts of mother-child pairs (n_=_353) followed over a 2-4__ear time period using longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (2000 COHORT: 2000-2004; 2004 COHORT: 2004-2006). Comparable mother-child PA behaviors included total metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET-hrs/wk) from active commuting, leisure-time sports, and sedentary behaviors. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between mother and child PA and relationships between PA behaviors and socioeconomic variables. RESULTS: Children experienced increases in active commuting and leisure-time sports activities with increasing child age, whereas mothers experienced temporal declines in active commuting and minimal change in leisure-time sports activity. Sedentary behavior was high for children and mothers over time. Mother-child associations were positive for active commuting and leisure-time sports activities and negative for sedentary behavior (P_< _0.05). Maternal education was associated with a greater likelihood of high leisure-time sports activity and high sedentary behavior in mothers but not in children (P_< _0.05). CONCLUSION: Efforts to reduce sedentary behavior in Chinese mothers and children are imperative. While increased leisure-time and active commuting activities in children is encouraging, continued PA promotion in children and more intensive efforts to promote leisure-time sports and active commuting in mothers is needed.",,,9,,,
2632,"Trends in domain-specific physical activity and sedentary behaviors among Chinese school children, 2004-2011 BACKGROUND: Dramatic increases in child overweight have occurred in China. A comprehensive look at trends in physical activity and sedentary behaviors among Chinese youth is needed. The study aimed to examine trends in domain-specific physical activity and sedentary behaviors, explore mean and distributional changes in predicted behaviors over time, and investigate how behaviors vary by residence. METHODS: Using 2004-2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey data, adjusted means for MET-hours/week from physical activity and hours/week from sedentary behaviors were determined for school children (6-18_years), stratifying by gender, age group, and residence. Physical activity domains included in-school physical activity, active leisure (out-of-school physical activity), active travel (walking or biking), and domestic activity (cooking, cleaning, and child care). For each physical activity domain, the MET-hours/week measure was determined from the total weekly time spent (hours) in domain-specific activities and corresponding MET-values using the Compendium of Energy Expenditures for Youth. Sedentary behaviors included television, computer use, homework, and other behaviors (board games, toys, extracurricular reading and writing). For each sedentary behavior, the hours/week measure was determined from total weekly time spent in specific sedentary behaviors. Residence groups included megacities (population___20million), cities/towns (300,000____opulation_< _20million), and rural/suburban areas (population_< _300,000). Repeated measure linear mixed and quantile regression models were used to predict adjusted means. RESULTS: Little change in physical activity behaviors occurred over time, with the exception of statistically significant trends toward increased domestic activity among male children (p_< _.05). Across all gender and age groups, statistically significant trends over time toward an average increase in computer use were seen (p_< _.01); these increases were largely driven by those _50th percentile on the distribution. Children living in megacities (versus rural areas) reported higher levels of physical activity, homework, and computer use. CONCLUSIONS: Intensified, systematic intervention and policy efforts promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors among children are needed.",,,9,,,
2633,"Human norovirus detection and production, quantification, and storage of virus-like particles Human noroviruses constitute a significant worldwide disease burden. Each year, noroviruses cause over 267 million infections, deaths in over 200,000 children under the age of five, and over 50% of U.S. food-borne illness. Due to the absence of a tissue culture model or small animal model to study human norovirus, virus-like particles (VLPs) and ELISA-based biological assays have been used to answer questions about norovirus evolution and immunity as well to provide a potential vaccine platform. This chapter outlines the protocols for norovirus detection in stool, as well as norovirus VLP design, production, purification, and storage using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)-based virus replicon particle (VRP) expression system.

2634,"Genetic mapping of a highly variable norovirus GII.4 blockade epitope: potential role in escape from human herd immunity Noroviruses account for 96% of viral gastroenteritis cases worldwide, with GII.4 strains responsible >80% of norovirus outbreaks. Histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are norovirus binding ligands, and antigenic and preferential HBGA binding profiles vary over time as new GII.4 strains emerge. The capsid P2 subdomain facilitates HBGA binding, contains neutralizing antibody epitopes, and likely evolves in response to herd immunity. To identify amino acids regulating HBGA binding and antigenic differences over time, we created chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) between the GII.4-1987 and GII.4-2006 strains by exchanging amino acids in putative epitopes and characterized their antigenic and HBGA binding profiles using anti-GII.4-1987 and -2006 mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal sera, 1988 outbreak human sera, and synthetic HBGAs. The exchange of amino acids 393 to 395 between GII.4-1987 and GII.4-2006 resulted in altered synthetic HBGA binding compared to parental strains. Introduction of GII.4-1987 residues 294, 297 to 298, 368, and 372 (epitope A) into GII.4-2006 resulted in reactivity with three anti-GII.4-1987 MAbs and reduced reactivity with four anti-GII.4-2006 MAbs. The three anti-GII.4-1987 MAbs also blocked chimeric VLP-HBGA interaction, while an anti-GII.4-2006 blocking antibody did not, indicating that epitope A amino acids comprise a potential neutralizing epitope for GII.4-1987 and GII.4-2006. We also tested GII.4-1987-immunized mouse polyclonal sera and 1988 outbreak human sera for the ability to block chimeric VLP-HBGA interaction and found that epitope A amino acids contribute significantly to the GII.4-1987 blockade response. Our data provide insights that help explain the emergence of new GII.4 epidemic strains over time, may aid development of norovirus therapeutics, and may help predict the emergence of future epidemic strains.",,,1,,,
2635,"The state of norovirus vaccines Noroviruses represent the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide; however, currently no licensed vaccine exists. Widespread vaccination that minimizes overall norovirus disease burden would benefit the entire population, but targeted vaccination of specific populations such as healthcare workers may further mitigate the risk of severe disease and death in vulnerable populations. While a few obstacles hinder the rapid development of efficacious vaccines, human trials for virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines show promise in both immune response and protection studies, with availability of vaccines being targeted over the next 5-10 years. Ongoing work including identification of important norovirus capsid antigenic sites, development of improved model systems, and continued studies in humans will allow improvement of future vaccines. In the meantime, a better understanding of norovirus disease course and transmission patterns can aid healthcare workers as they take steps to protect high-risk populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals from chronic and severe disease. _ The Author 2014.

2636,"Emergence of new pandemic GII.4 Sydney norovirus strain correlates with escape from herd immunity BACKGROUND: GII.4 noroviruses are a significant source of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, causing the majority of human norovirus outbreaks. Evolution of the GII.4 major capsid protein occurs rapidly, resulting in the emergence of new strains that produce successive waves of pandemic disease. A new pandemic isolate, GII.4 2012 Sydney, largely replaced previously circulating strains in late 2012. We compare the antigenic properties of GII.4 2012 Sydney with previously circulating strains. METHODS: To determine whether GII.4-2012 Sydney is antigenically different from recently circulating strains GII.4-2006 Minerva and GII.4-2009 New Orleans in previously identified blockade epitopes, we compared reactivity and blockade profiles of GII.4-2006, GII.4-2009, and GII.4-2012 virus-like particles in surrogate neutralization/blockade assays using monoclonal antibodies and human polyclonal sera. RESULTS: Using monoclonal antibodies that map to known blockade epitopes in GII.4-2006 and GII.4-2009 and human outbreak polyclonal sera, we demonstrate either complete loss or significantly reduced reactivity and blockade of GII.4.2012 compared to GII.4-2006 and GII.4-2009. CONCLUSIONS: GII.4-2012 Sydney is antigenically different from GII.4-2006 Minerva and GII.4-2009 New Orleans in at least 2 key blockade epitopes. Viral evolution in key potential neutralization epitopes likely allowed GII.4-2012 to escape from human herd immunity and emerge as the new predominant strain.",,,1,,,
2637,"Chimeric GII.4 norovirus virus-like-particle-based vaccines induce broadly blocking immune responses UNLABELLED: There is currently no licensed vaccine for noroviruses, and development is hindered, in part, by an incomplete understanding of the host adaptive immune response to these highly heterogeneous viruses and rapid GII.4 norovirus molecular evolution. Emergence of a new predominant GII.4 norovirus strain occurs every 2 to 4 years. To address the problem of GII.4 antigenic variation, we tested the hypothesis that chimeric virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine platforms, which incorporate antigenic determinants from multiple strains into a single genetic background, will elicit a broader immune response against contemporary and emergent strains. Here, we compare the immune response generated by chimeric VLPs to that of parental strains and a multivalent VLP cocktail. Results demonstrate that chimeric VLPs induce a more broadly cross-blocking immune response than single parental VLPs and a similar response to a multivalent GII.4 VLP cocktail. Furthermore, we show that incorporating epitope site A alone from one strain into the background of another is sufficient to induce a blockade response against the strain donating epitope site A. This suggests a mechanism by which population-wide surveillance of mutations in a single epitope could be used to evaluate antigenic changes in order to identify potential emergent strains and quickly reformulate vaccines against future epidemic strains as they emerge in human populations. IMPORTANCE: Noroviruses are gastrointestinal pathogens that infect an estimated 21 million people per year in the United States alone. GII.4 noroviruses account for >70% of all outbreaks, making them the most clinically important genotype. GII.4 noroviruses undergo a pattern of epochal evolution, resulting in the emergence of new strains with altered antigenicity over time, complicating vaccine design. This work is relevant to norovirus vaccine design as it demonstrates the potential for development of a chimeric VLP-based vaccine platform that may broaden the protective response against multiple GII.4 strains and proposes a potential reformulation strategy to control newly emergent strains in the human population.

2638,"Within-host evolution results in antigenically distinct GII.4 noroviruses UNLABELLED: Genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) noroviruses are known to rapidly evolve, with the emergence of a new primary strain every 2 to 4 years as herd immunity to the previously circulating strain is overcome. Because viral genetic diversity is higher in chronic than in acute infection, chronically infected immunocompromised people have been hypothesized to be a potential source for new epidemic GII.4 strains. However, while some capsid protein residues are under positive selection and undergo patterned changes in sequence variation over time, the relationships between genetic variation and antigenic variation remains unknown. Based on previously published GII.4 strains from a chronically infected individual, we synthetically reconstructed virus-like particles (VLPs) representing early and late isolates from a small-bowel transplant patient chronically infected with norovirus, as well as the parental GII.4-2006b strain. We demonstrate that intrahost GII.4 evolution results in the emergence of antigenically distinct strains over time, comparable to the variation noted between the chronologically predominant GII.4 strains GII.4-2006b and GII.4-2009. Our data suggest that in some individuals the evolution that occurs during a chronic norovirus infection overlaps with changing antigenic epitopes that are associated with successive outbreak strains and may select for isolates that are potentially able to escape herd immunity from earlier isolates. IMPORTANCE: Noroviruses are agents of gastrointestinal illness, infecting an estimated 21 million people per year in the United States alone. In healthy individuals, symptomatic infection typically resolves within 24 to 48 h. However, symptoms may persist for years in immunocompromised individuals, and development of successful treatments for these patients is a continuing challenge. This work is relevant to the design of successful norovirus therapeutics for chronically infected patients; provides support for previous assertions that chronically infected individuals may serve as reservoirs for new, antigenically unique emergent strains; and furthers our understanding of genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) norovirus immune-driven molecular evolution.

2639,"Genome-wide association studies of MRI-defined brain infarcts: meta-analysis from the CHARGE Consortium BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies examining genetic associations with MRI-defined brain infarct have yielded inconsistent findings. We investigated genetic variation underlying covert MRI infarct in persons without histories of transient ischemic attack or stroke. We performed meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of white participants in 6 studies comprising the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium. METHODS: Using 2.2 million genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms, each study performed cross-sectional genome-wide association analysis of MRI infarct using age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models. Study-specific findings were combined in an inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis, including 9401 participants with mean age 69.7 (19.4% of whom had >or=1 MRI infarct). RESULTS: The most significant association was found with rs2208454 (minor allele frequency, 20%), located in intron 3 of MACRO domain containing 2 gene and in the downstream region of fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 3 gene. Each copy of the minor allele was associated with lower risk of MRI infarcts (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.84; P=4.64x10(-7)). Highly suggestive associations (P< 1.0x10(-5)) were also found for 22 other single nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium (r(2)>0.64) with rs2208454. The association with rs2208454 did not replicate in independent samples of 1822 white and 644 black participants, although 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 200 kb from rs2208454 were associated with MRI infarcts in the black population sample. CONCLUSIONS: This first community-based, genome-wide association study on covert MRI infarcts uncovered novel associations. Although replication of the association with top single nucleotide polymorphisms failed, possibly because of insufficient power, results in the black population sample are encouraging, and further efforts at replication are needed.",,,8,,,
2640,"Genome-wide studies of verbal declarative memory in nondemented older people: the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium BACKGROUND: Memory performance in older persons can reflect genetic influences on cognitive function and dementing processes. We aimed to identify genetic contributions to verbal declarative memory in a community setting. METHODS: We conducted genome-wide association studies for paragraph or word list delayed recall in 19 cohorts from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium, comprising 29,076 dementia- and stroke-free individuals of European descent, aged _45 years. Replication of suggestive associations (p < 5 _ 10(-6)) was sought in 10,617 participants of European descent, 3811 African-Americans, and 1561 young adults. RESULTS: rs4420638, near APOE, was associated with poorer delayed recall performance in discovery (p = 5.57 _ 10(-10)) and replication cohorts (p = 5.65 _ 10(-8)). This association was stronger for paragraph than word list delayed recall and in the oldest persons. Two associations with specific tests, in subsets of the total sample, reached genome-wide significance in combined analyses of discovery and replication (rs11074779 [HS3ST4], p = 3.11 _ 10(-8), and rs6813517 [SPOCK3], p = 2.58 _ 10(-8)) near genes involved in immune response. A genetic score combining 58 independent suggestive memory risk variants was associated with increasing Alzheimer disease pathology in 725 autopsy samples. Association of memory risk loci with gene expression in 138 human hippocampus samples showed cis-associations with WDR48 and CLDN5, both related to ubiquitin metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This largest study to date exploring the genetics of memory function in ~40,000 older individuals revealed genome-wide associations and suggested an involvement of immune and ubiquitin pathways.

2641,"Race, menopausal hormone therapy, and invasive breast cancer in the carolina breast cancer study PURPOSE: The use of combined estrogen-progestin menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer, however, recent observational studies have suggested that the association between MHT and breast cancer may be modified by race. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between MHT use and incidence of invasive breast cancer in Black and White women aged _40 years at diagnosis after accounting for racial differences in patterns of MHT use and formulation. METHODS: Data from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study of Black and White women in North Carolina conducted between 1993 and 2001, was used to analyze 1474 invasive breast cancer cases and 1339 controls using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Black women were less likely than White women to use any MHT and were more likely to use an unopposed-estrogen formulation. Combined estrogen-progestin MHT use was associated with a greater odds of breast cancer in White (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-2.13) and Black (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 0.76-2.70) women, although the estimate in Black women was imprecise. In contrast, use of unopposed-estrogen MHT among women with prior hysterectomy was not associated with breast cancer in women of either race. CONCLUSION: The association between MHT and invasive breast cancer appears to be similar in both Black and White women after accounting for differences in formulation and prior hysterectomy. These findings emphasize the importance of accounting for MHT formulation in race-stratified analyses of breast cancer risk.",,,3,,,
2642,"A novel tumor suppressor function of glycine N-methyltransferase is independent of its catalytic activity but requires nuclear localization Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), an abundant cytosolic enzyme, catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to glycine generating S-adenosylhomocysteine and sarcosine (N-methylglycine). This reaction is regulated by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which inhibits the enzyme catalysis. In the present study, we observed that GNMT is strongly down regulated in human cancers and is undetectable in cancer cell lines while the transient expression of the protein in cancer cells induces apoptosis and results in the activation of ERK1/2 as an early pro-survival response. The antiproliferative effect of GNMT can be partially reversed by treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk but not by supplementation with high folate or SAM. GNMT exerts the suppressor effect primarily in cells originated from malignant tumors: transformed cell line of non-cancer origin, HEK293, was insensitive to GNMT. Of note, high levels of GNMT, detected in regenerating liver and in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, do not produce cytotoxic effects. Importantly, GNMT, a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, was translocated into nuclei upon transfection of cancer cells. The presence of GNMT in the nuclei was also observed in normal human tissues by immunohistochemical staining. We further demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis is associated with the GNMT nuclear localization but is independent of its catalytic activity or folate binding. GNMT targeted to nuclei, through the fusion with nuclear localization signal, still exerts strong antiproliferative effects while its restriction to cytoplasm, through the fusion with nuclear export signal, prevents these effects (in each case the protein was excluded from cytosol or nuclei, respectively). Overall, our study indicates that GNMT has a secondary function, as a regulator of cellular proliferation, which is independent of its catalytic role.",,,1,,,
2643,"Injection drug use, sexual risk, violence and STI/HIV among Moscow female sex workers BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The HIV prevalence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia continues to increase. While injection drug use (IDU) is leading factor, heterosexual transmission is on the rise. Little is known about female sex workers (FSWs) in the region despite the central role of commercial sex in heterosexual sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV transmission globally. The authors evaluated the prevalence of STI/HIV among Moscow-based FSWs and potential risk factors including IDU, sexual risks and violence victimisation. METHODS: Moscow-based FSWs (n=147) completed a clinic-based survey and STI/HIV testing over an 8-month period in 2005. RESULTS: HIV prevalence was 4.8%, and 31.3% were infected with at least one STI including HIV. Sexual behaviours significantly associated with STI/HIV included anal sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.48), high client volume (three or more clients daily, AOR 2.71), recent subbotnik (sex demanded by police; AOR 2.50) and regularly being presented with more clients than initially agreed to (AOR 2.45). Past year experiences of physical violence from clients and threats of violence from pimps were associated with STI/HIV (AOR 3.14 and AOR 3.65, respectively). IDU was not significantly associated with STI/HIV. Anal sex and high client volume partially mediated the associations of abuse with STI/HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Findings illustrate substantial potential for heterosexual STI/HIV transmission in a setting better known for IDU-related risk. Many of the STI/HIV risks observed are not modifiable by FSWs alone. STI/HIV prevention efforts for this vulnerable population will benefit from reducing coercion and abuse perpetrated by pimps and clients.",,,6,,,

2645,"Physical activity calorie expenditure (PACE) labels in worksite cafeterias: effects on physical activity BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity is an important component of healthy living and wellbeing. Current guidelines recommend that adults participate in at least 150__in of moderate or vigorous-intensity physical activity weekly. In spite of the benefits, just over half of U.S. adults meet these recommendations. Calorie-only food labels at points of food purchase have had limited success in motivating people to change eating behaviors and increase physical activity. One new point of purchase approach to promote healthy behaviors is the addition of food labels that display the physical activity requirement needed to burn the calories in a food item (e.g. walk 15__in). METHODS: The Physical Activity Calorie Expenditure (PACE) Study compared activity-based calorie-expenditure food labels with calorie-only labels at three Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina worksite cafeterias. After 1_year of baseline data collection, one cafeteria had food items labeled with PACE labels, two others had calorie-only food labels. Cohort participants were asked to wear an accelerometer and complete a self-report activity questionnaire on two occasions during the baseline year and twice during the intervention year. RESULTS: A total of 366 study participants were included in the analysis. In the PACE-label group, self-reported physical activity increased by 13-26% compared to the calorie-only label group. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) increased by 24__in per week in the PACE-label group compared to the calorie-label group (p_=_0.06). Changes in accelerometer measured steps, sedentary time, and MVPA had modest increases. Change ranged from 1 to 12% with effect size values from 0.08 to 0.15. Baseline physical activity level significantly moderated the intervention effects for all physical activity outcomes. Participants in both label groups starting in the lowest tertile of activity saw the largest increase in their physical activity. CONCLUSION: Results suggest small positive effects for the PACE labels on self-reported and objective physical activity measures. Minutes of weekly MVPA, strength training, and exercise activities showed modest increases. These results suggest that calorie-expenditure food labels may result in some limited increases in physical activity.",,,9,,,
2646,"Injectable Progestin-Only Contraception is Associated With Increased Levels of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in the Female Genital Tract PROBLEM: Genital inflammatory changes may be a mechanism of increased HIV risk among injectable progestin-only contraception (IPC) users. METHOD OF STUDY: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 376 Kenyan and South African women. Genital cytokines and secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor concentrations in a reference population were compared to IPC users and women with reproductive tract infections. RESULTS: No significant variability in marker concentrations was observed by age or site. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) users had significantly higher MIP-1_, MIP-1_, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and RANTES concentrations. Norethisterone oenanthate users had significantly higher IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES concentrations. Women with sexually transmitted infections had variable inflammation, and women with bacterial vaginosis exhibited a mixed profile of up and downregulation. CONCLUSION: The finding of substantial mucosal inflammation among DMPA users provides evidence which, combined with the results of prior studies, suggests that DMPA may create an immune environment conducive to HIV target cell recruitment and inhibitory for antiviral activity. _ 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2648,"A model of the influence of false-positive mammography screening results on subsequent screening Decades of empirical research have demonstrated psychological and behavioural consequences of false-positive medical tests. To organise this literature and offer novel predictions, we propose a model of how false-positive mammography results affect return for subsequent mammography screening. We propose that false-positive mammography results alter how women think about themselves (e.g., increasing their perceived likelihood of getting breast cancer) and the screening test (e.g., believing mammography test results are less accurate). We further hypothesise that thoughts elicited by the false-positive experience will, in turn, affect future use of screening mammography. In addition, we discuss methodological considerations for statistical analyses of these mediational pathways and propose two classes of potential moderators. While our model focuses on mammography screening, it may be applicable to psychological and behavioural responses to other screening tests. The model is especially timely as false-positive medical test results are increasingly common, due to efforts to increase uptake of cancer screening, new technologies that improve existing tests' ability to detect disease at the cost of increased false alarms, and growing numbers of new medical tests.",,,3,,,
2649,"Understanding how breast cancer patients use risk information from genomic tests We sought to examine how patients' treatment decisions incorporate potentially conflicting information from standard clinical indicators (e.g., tumor size) and genomic tests for breast cancer recurrence risk. Participants were 77 early stage breast cancer survivors who previously received genomic testing. They read six hypothetical vignettes that varied recurrence risk indicated by standard tests (low or high risk) coupled with the genomic test (low, intermediate or high risk). For each vignette, women reported their perceived recurrence risk and treatment preferences. Test results indicating high recurrence risk increased perception of risk and preference for chemotherapy (p_< _.001 for all). Perceived risk explained (i.e., mediated) the effect of test results on chemotherapy preferences. When test results conflicted, women gave more weight to genomic over standard test results. Hypothetical genomic test results had the intended effect of influencing women's perceptions of recurrence risk and interest in chemotherapy.",,,3,,,
2650,"Who gets genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk? BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our study examined whether patient characteristics, beliefs and decision-making styles were associated with uptake of genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk. METHODS: Participants were 132 early-stage breast cancer patients eligible for the Oncotype DX genomic test. We interviewed patients in 2009-2010 and obtained information from medical charts. RESULTS: Half of the women eligible for genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk received it. The most common reason for not getting the test was that women's physicians did not offer it (80%). Test recipients were more likely to be unsure about receiving chemotherapy treatment compared to women who did not receive the test (p < 0.05). Women who received the test had less advanced disease pathologies, recalled a lower objective recurrence risk, perceived lower recurrence risk, and were slightly younger (all p < 0.05). Most women who described their decision-making style as active received the test (75%), whereas few women who described their style as passive received the test (12%) (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In the university clinic we studied, genomic testing appeared to be more common among patients who may benefit most from the information provided by results, but confirmation in larger studies is needed. _ 2013 S.

2651,"Genome-Wide Association Study for Incident Myocardial Infarction and Coronary Heart Disease in Prospective Cohort Studies: The CHARGE Consortium BACKGROUND: Data are limited on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for incident coronary heart disease (CHD). Moreover, it is not known whether genetic variants identified to date also associate with risk of CHD in a prospective setting. METHODS: We performed a two-stage GWAS analysis of incident myocardial infarction (MI) and CHD in a total of 64,297 individuals (including 3898 MI cases, 5465 CHD cases). SNPs that passed an arbitrary threshold of 5_10-6 in Stage I were taken to Stage II for further discovery. Furthermore, in an analysis of prognosis, we studied whether known SNPs from former GWAS were associated with total mortality in individuals who experienced MI during follow-up. RESULTS: In Stage I 15 loci passed the threshold of 5_10-6; 8 loci for MI and 8 loci for CHD, for which one locus overlapped and none were reported in previous GWAS meta-analyses. We took 60 SNPs representing these 15 loci to Stage II of discovery. Four SNPs near QKI showed nominally significant association with MI (p-value< 8.8_10-3) and three exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold when Stage I and Stage II results were combined (top SNP rs6941513: p = 6.2_10-9). Despite excellent power, the 9p21 locus SNP (rs1333049) was only modestly associated with MI (HR = 1.09, p-value = 0.02) and marginally with CHD (HR = 1.06, p-value = 0.08). Among an inception cohort of those who experienced MI during follow-up, the risk allele of rs1333049 was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent mortality (HR = 0.90, p-value = 3.2_10-3). CONCLUSIONS: QKI represents a novel locus that may serve as a predictor of incident CHD in prospective studies. The association of the 9p21 locus both with increased risk of first myocardial infarction and longer survival after MI highlights the importance of study design in investigating genetic determinants of complex disorders.",,,8,,,
2652,"Association between gestational diabetes and incident maternal CKD: the coronary artery risk development in young adults (CARDIA) study BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk for diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. We evaluated whether GDM is associated with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), controlling for prepregnancy risk factors for both conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Of 2,747 women (aged 18-30 years) enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study in 1985 to 86, we studied 820 who were nulliparous at enrollment, delivered at least 1 pregnancy longer than 20 weeks' gestation, and had kidney function measurements during 25 years of follow-up. PREDICTOR: GDM was self-reported by women for each pregnancy. OUTCOMES: CKD was defined as the development of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)< 60mL/min/1.73m2 or urine albumin-creatinine ratio__ 25mg/g at any one CARDIA examination in years 10, 15, 20, or_25. MEASUREMENTS: HRs for developing CKD were estimated for women who developed GDM versus women without GDM using complementary log-log models, adjusting for prepregnancy age, systolic blood pressure, dyslipidemia, body mass index, smoking, education, eGFR, fasting glucose concentration, physical activity level (all measured at the CARDIA examination before the first pregnancy), race, and family history of diabetes. We explored for an interaction between race and GDM. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 20.8 years, 105 of 820 (12.8%) women developed CKD, predominantly increased urine albumin excretion (98 albuminuria only, 4 decreased eGFR only, and 3 both). There was evidence of a GDM-race interaction on CKD risk (P=0.06). Among black women, the adjusted HR for CKD was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.04-3.67) in GDM compared with those without GDM. Among white women, the HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.23-1.83). LIMITATIONS: Albuminuria was assessed by single untimed measurements of urine albumin and creatinine. CONCLUSIONS: GDM is associated with the subsequent development of albuminuria among black women in CARDIA. Copyright _ 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

2653,"Physical activity during pregnancy and risk of hyperglycemia OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between moderate and vigorous physical activities (MVPA) during midpregnancy and the risk of hyperglycemia. METHODS: Data were from 1437 pregnant women. Frequency, duration, and intensity of MVPA during the previous 7 days were collected via questionnaire at 17-22 weeks' gestation. Modes of MVPA included work, recreation, transportation, caregiving, and indoor and outdoor household activities. Hyperglycemia was defined as a glucose concentration _130 mg/dL on a 1-hour, 50-g glucose challenge test or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) assessed at ~27 weeks' gestation. Multivariable Poisson regression estimated risks of hyperglycemia associated with total and mode-specific MVPA. RESULTS: There were 269 women (18.7%) with hyperglycemia. Any metabolic equivalent (MET) hours/week of recreational MVPA was associated with a 27% lower risk of hyperglycemia (adjusted relative risk, [aRR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.54-0.99). Multiplicative interaction terms were significant for prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and recreational MVPA (p=0.01). Among women with prepregnancy BMI < 25 kg/m(2), recreational MVPA was associated with a 48% lower risk of hyperglycemia (aRR 0.52, 95%CI 0.33-0.83) compared to women who reported none. There was no association of hyperglycemia and recreational MVPA among women with prepregnancy BMI < 25 kg/m(2). CONCLUSIONS: Recreational MVPA during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of hyperglycemia, specifically among women with prepregnancy BMI < 25 kg/m(2). Further research is warranted to determine recommended amounts and intensities of physical activity and to discern whether there are differences in the effects of physical activity between specific modes of physical activity or among subgroups of women in relation to hyperglycemia.",,,9,,,
2654,"Self-reported dietary intake of youth with recent onset of type 2 diabetes: results from the TODAY study Despite the widely recognized importance of diet in managing diabetes, few studies have documented usual dietary intake in young people with type 2 diabetes. The objectives of our study were to assess dietary intake among a large, ethnically diverse cohort of young people with type 2 diabetes and compare intake to current recommendations. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study is a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 699 youth aged 10 to 17 years. At baseline, following a run-in period that included standard diabetes education, diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire between 2004 and 2009. Analysis of variance and nonparametric tests were used to compare mean and median nutrient intakes; logistic regression was used to compare the odds of meeting predefined dietary intake recommendation cutpoints between subgroups of age, sex, and race-ethnicity. Percent of energy from saturated fat was consistently 13% to 14% across all subgroups-substantially exceeding national recommendations. Overall, only 12% of youth met Healthy People 2010 guidelines for intake of < 10% of energy from saturated fat and only 1% of youth met American Diabetes Association recommendations for intake of < 7% of energy from saturated fat. Dietary intake fell substantially below other Healthy People 2010 targets; only 3% met calcium intake goals, 11% met fruit consumption goals, 5% met vegetable consumption goals, and 67% met grain intake goals. Overall, dietary intake in this large cohort of young people with type 2 diabetes fell substantially short of recommendations, in ways that were consistent by sex, age, and race-ethnicity. The data suggest a critical need for better approaches to improve dietary intake of these young people. Copyright _ 2013 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

2655,"Price changes alone are not adequate to produce long-term dietary change Taxation has been proposed as a means to reduce consumption of unhealthy food items. However, it is unknown if taxation without regulations or other activities known to shift eating behaviors lead to long-term dietary change. This unexplored issue is examined using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. Data were from adults aged 25-55 y who participated in the nationally representative Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls, detailed food expenditure data, and community-level food prices collected over 1994-2005 were used for these analyses. Longitudinal random effects models were used to test the relation of time on the structure of diet while controlling for total household expenditures. The proportion of total energy consumed from fat was higher in all other years combined compared with 1998 (P < 0.001). The proportion of dietary fat from high-fat meat and high-fat dairy items were lowest in 1998 and increased over subsequent years despite increasing costs. Percent fat from fats and oils continued to decline with rising costs. Price changes led to substantial shifts in the structure of food consumption. However, except for the most expensive items, consumption of items returned to levels consumed in the former Soviet Union following price stabilization.",,,4,,,
2656,"Childhood anxiety associated with low BMI in women with anorexia nervosa OBJECTIVE: Extremely low body mass index (BMI) values are associated with increased risk for death and poor long-term prognosis in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). The present study explores childhood personality characteristics that could be associated with the ability to attain an extremely low BMI. METHODS: Participants were 326 women from the Genetics of Anorexia Nervosa (GAN) Study who completed the Structured Interview for Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimic Syndromes and whose mother completed the Child Behavioral Checklist and/or Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey. RESULTS: Children who were described as having greater fear or anxiety by their mothers attained lower BMIs during AN (p < 0.02). Path analysis in the GAN and a validation sample, Price Foundation Anorexia Nervosa Trios Study, confirmed the relation between early childhood anxiety, caloric restriction, qualitative food item restriction, excessive exercise, and low BMI. Path analysis also confirmed a relation between childhood anxiety and caloric restriction, which mediated the relation between childhood anxiety and low BMI in the GAN sample only. CONCLUSION: Fearful or anxious behavior as a child was associated with the attainment of low BMI in AN and childhood anxiety was associated with caloric restriction. Measures of anxiety and factors associated with anxiety-proneness in childhood may index children at risk for restrictive behaviors and extremely low BMIs in AN. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2658,"Diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis: current approach and future directions Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic inflammatory condition with a rapidly evolving epidemiology, is now a major cause of esophageal disease. Current guidelines emphasize that EoE is a clinicopathologic condition with the following criteria: clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction; at least 15 eosinophils in one high-power field on esophageal biopsy; and lack of responsiveness to high-dose proton-pump inhibition or normal pH monitoring of the distal esophagus. Challenges in diagnosis include lack of standardized esophageal biopsy protocols, variability in how eosinophil counts are determined, variability in the size of microscope high-power fields, and the need to evaluate the differential diagnosis of esophageal eosinophilia. In particular, the complex interplay between esophageal eosinophilia, EoE, and reflux disease remains an area both of controversy and active study. In the future, diagnostic strategies could include symptom scores, tissue or noninvasive biomarkers, and/or genetic expression profiles. _ Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011",,,1,,,
2659,"Eosinophilic esophagitis: diagnostic tests and criteria PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), review the current diagnostic guidelines for EoE, and present an approach for diagnosis of EoE. It will also highlight selected techniques that are under development that may be useful in the future for diagnosis of EoE. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently updated guidelines emphasize that EoE is a clinicopathologic condition. Specifically, three criteria must be met to diagnose EoE: clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction; an esophageal biopsy with a maximum eosinophil count of at least 15 eosinophils per high-power microscopy field, with few exceptions; and exclusion of other possible causes of esophageal eosinophilia, including proton-pump inhibitor responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE). A PPI trial is typically required both to assess for PPI-REE and to evaluate for the presence of concomitant gastroesophageal reflux disease. SUMMARY: EoE is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder. Because no single symptom, endoscopic finding, or histopathologic feature is pathognomonic, diagnosis can be challenging. In the future, symptom scores, tissue or serum biomarkers, and genetic testing may play a role in diagnosis, but these methods have yet to be validated and are not yet recommended for routine clinical use.",,,1,,,
2660,"Epidemiology of eosinophilic esophagitis In this article, the epidemiology of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is reviewed. Demographic features and natural history are described, the prevalence and incidence of EoE are highlighted, and risk factors for EoE are discussed. EoE can occur at any age, there is a male predominance, it is more common in whites, and there is a strong association with atopic diseases. EoE is chronic, relapses are frequent, and persistent inflammation increases the risk of fibrostenotic complications. The prevalence is currently estimated at 0.5-1 in 1000, and EoE is now the most common cause of food impaction. The incidence of EoE is approximately 1/10,000 new cases per year, and the increase in incidence is outpacing increases in recognition and endoscopy volume, but the reasons for this evolving epidemiology are not yet fully delineated.

2661,"A phenotypic analysis shows that eosinophilic esophagitis is a progressive fibrostenotic disease BACKGROUND: Phenotypes of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are not well-characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical features of patients with EoE with predefined phenotypes, determine predictors of these phenotypes, and make inferences about the natural history of EoE. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center. PATIENTS: Incident EoE cases from 2001 to 2011 that met consensus diagnostic guidelines. INTERVENTION: Review of records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Endoscopic phenotypes, including fibrostenotic, inflammatory, or mixed. Other groups of clinical characteristics examined included atopy, level of esophageal eosinophilia, and age of symptom onset. Multinomial logistic regression assessed predictors of phenotype status. RESULTS: Of 379 cases of EoE identified, there were no significant phenotypic differences by atopic status or level of eosinophilia. Those with the inflammatory phenotype were more likely to be younger than those with mixed or fibrostenotic (13 vs 29 vs 39 years, respectively; P < .001) and less likely to have dysphagia, food impaction, and esophageal dilation (P < .001 for all). The mean symptom length before diagnosis was shorter for inflammatory (5 vs 8 vs 8 years; P = .02). After multivariate analysis, age and dysphagia independently predicted phenotype. The odds ratio (OR) for fibrostenosis for each 10-year increase in age was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.7-2.7). The OR for dysphagia was 7.0 (95% CI, 2.6-18.6). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective, single-center study. CONCLUSION: In this large EoE cohort, the likelihood of fibrostenotic disease increased markedly with age. For every 10-year increase in age, the odds of having a fibrostenotic EoE phenotype more than doubled. This association suggests that the natural history of EoE is a progression from an inflammatory to a fibrostenotic disease. Copyright _ 2014 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

2662,"Updated international consensus diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis: proceedings of the AGREE conference BACKGROUND & AIMS: Over the last decade, clinical experiences and research studies raised concerns regarding use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as part of the diagnostic strategy for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We aimed to clarify the use of PPIs in the evaluation and treatment of children and adults with suspected EoE to develop updated international consensus criteria for EoE diagnosis. METHODS: A consensus conference was convened to address the issue of PPI use for esophageal eosinophilia using a process consistent with standards described in the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II. Pediatric and adult physicians and researchers from gastroenterology, allergy, and pathology subspecialties representing 14 countries used online communications, teleconferences, and a face-to-face meeting to review the literature and clinical experiences. RESULTS: Substantial evidence documented that PPIs reduce esophageal eosinophilia in children, adolescents, and adults, with several mechanisms potentially explaining the treatment effect. Based on these findings, an updated diagnostic algorithm for EoE was developed, with removal of the PPI trial requirement. CONCLUSIONS: EoE should be diagnosed when there are symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field (or approximately 60 eosinophils per mm2) on esophageal biopsy and after a comprehensive assessment of non-EoE disorders that could cause or potentially contribute to esophageal eosinophilia. The evidence suggests that PPIs are better classified as a treatment for esophageal eosinophilia that may be due to EoE than as a diagnostic criterion, and we have developed updated consensus criteria for EoE that reflect this change.

2663,"Gene expression-phenotype associations in adults with eosinophilic esophagitis BACKGROUND: Gene expression patterns have not been extensively examined in the context of clinical features of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). AIMS: To assess whether gene expression is associated with clinically defined phenotypes in adults with EoE. METHODS: This was an analysis of prospectively collected esophageal biopsies in newly diagnosed EoE patients. We determined differential gene expression with a 94 gene panel in relation to clinical features and phenotypes. These included: endoscopic findings of esophageal rings, stricture, narrowing, linear furrows, exudates, edema, and dilation; an allergic phenotype; an inflammatory phenotype, and a fibrostenotic phenotype. RESULTS: In 89 EoE cases analyzed, patients with exudates on endoscopy had multiple differences in gene expression compared to patients without exudates, though patients with exudates also had higher eosinophil counts (172 vs 106eos/hpf; p=.01). Genes associated with esophageal narrowing included CCL26 (q-value=0.028), ALOX15 (q=0.011), GRK5 (q=0.029), CPA3 (q=0.012), and TRIM2 (q=0.0027). TRIM2 was also associated with the fibrostenotic phenotype (q=0.0051). No genes were associated with the inflammatory or atopic phenotypes, or with dilation. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple genes are associated with exudates, possibly related to higher eosinophil counts. However, a number of genes, including those related to both inflammation and remodelling, are associated with esophageal narrowing. In particular, TRIM2 is associated with clinical fibrotic phenotypes. Copyright _ 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,3,,,
2664,"A single biopsy is valid for genetic diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis regardless of tissue preservation or location in the esophagus BACKGROUND & AIMS: A new gene expression profile test may distinguish eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but the optimal tissue preparation and biopsy location are unknown. We aimed to determine if formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and RNA-later (RNAL) preserved specimens from newly diagnosed EoE patients have equivalent gene expression scores and whether scores vary by esophageal biopsy location. METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected and banked esophageal biopsies from EoE patients and GERD controls. Paired FFPE and RNAL samples from the distal, mid, and proximal esophagus were used. RNA was extracted, and gene expression for a previously constructed 96 gene panel was quantified with a summary expression score. Scores were compared between EoE and GERD patients, between FFPE and RNAL samples, and between the different esophageal locations. RESULTS: A total of 72 samples, representing paired FFPE and RNAL specimens from 9 EoE cases and 3 GERD controls, were analyzed. Overall median gene expression scores were similar between FFPE and RNAL (238 vs 227; p=0.64), correlation was excellent between FFPE and RNAL (Spearman's rho=0.90; p< 0.001), and there were no differences by biopsy level. Median gene scores distinguished EoE from controls (134 vs 402; p=0.02), and overall agreement between preservation methods and EoE case status was perfect (kappa=1.0; p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression scores were equivalent in FFPE and RNAL, and were also similar across three esophageal locations. This implies that a single biopsy in either FFPE or RNAL from anywhere in the esophagus may have the potential for genetic diagnosis of EoE.",,,1,,,
2665,"Longitudinal trajectories of physical intimate partner violence among adolescent girls in rural south africa: findings from HPTN 068 PURPOSE: Little is known about temporal patterns of physical intimate partner violence (PIPV) among South African adolescent girls. We sought to identify and describe PIPV risk trajectories and related correlates in this population. METHODS: Our analytical cohort came from the HPTN 068 Cash Transfer Trial in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Cohort members were eighth and ninth graders (median age 14_years) who enrolled in 2011 and had three to four annual, self-reported PIPV measurements. We used group-based trajectory models to identify groups of girls with similar longitudinal patterns of PIPV risk over 4 years and potential correlates of group membership. RESULTS: We identified two trajectory groups (n_= 907): a higher-risk group (~52.8% of the cohort) with predicted PIPV probabilities of 13.5%-41.1% over time and a lower-risk group (~47.2% of the cohort) with predicted probabilities of 2.3%-10.3%. Baseline correlates of higher-risk group membership were ever having had sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56-12.57), borrowing money (aOR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.01-3.79), and older age (aOR per 1-year_increase: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.11-1.73), while being in the 068 intervention arm (aOR: .29, 95% CI: .17-.51) and supporting more gender-equitable norms (aOR per 1-unit score increase: .89, 95% CI: .81-.97) were inversely associated. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of adolescent girls experience sustained PIPV risk in rural South Africa, suggesting a need for interventions in late primary school that encourage gender-equitable norms, healthy relationships, and safe ways to earn income during adolescence.

2668,"Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of BMI, BMI change and waist circumference in African American adults identifies multiple replicated loci Obesity is an important component of the pathophysiology of chronic diseases. Identifying epigenetic modifications associated with elevated adiposity, including DNA methylation variation, may point to genomic pathways that are dysregulated in numerous conditions. The Illumina 450K Bead Chip array was used to assay DNA methylation in leukocyte DNA obtained from 2097 African American adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test the association of methylation beta value with concurrent body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), and BMI change, adjusting for batch effects and potential confounders. Replication using whole-blood DNA from 2377 White adults in the Framingham Heart Study and CD4+ T cell DNA from 991 Whites in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network Study was followed by testing using adipose tissue DNA from 648 women in the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource cohort. Seventy-six BMI-related probes, 164 WC-related probes and 8 BMI change-related probes passed the threshold for significance in ARIC (P < 1 _ 10(-7); Bonferroni), including probes in the recently reported HIF3A, CPT1A and ABCG1 regions. Replication using blood DNA was achieved for 37 BMI probes and 1 additional WC probe. Sixteen of these also replicated in adipose tissue, including 15 novel methylation findings near genes involved in lipid metabolism, immune response/cytokine signaling and other diverse pathways, including LGALS3BP, KDM2B, PBX1 and BBS2, among others. Adiposity traits are associated with DNA methylation at numerous CpG sites that replicate across studies despite variation in tissue type, ethnicity and analytic approaches. _ The Author 2015.

2669,"Genome-wide association study of age at menarche in African-American women African-American (AA) women have earlier menarche on average than women of European ancestry (EA), and earlier menarche is a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes among other chronic diseases. Identification of common genetic variants associated with age at menarche has a potential value in pointing to the genetic pathways underlying chronic disease risk, yet comprehensive genome-wide studies of age at menarche are lacking for AA women. In this study, we tested the genome-wide association of self-reported age at menarche with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a total of 18 089 AA women in 15 studies using an additive genetic linear regression model, adjusting for year of birth and population stratification, followed by inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis (Stage 1). Top meta-analysis results were then tested in an independent sample of 2850 women (Stage 2). First, while no SNP passed the pre-specified P < 5 _ 10(-8) threshold for significance in Stage 1, suggestive associations were found for variants near FLRT2 and PIK3R1, and conditional analysis identified two independent SNPs (rs339978 and rs980000) in or near RORA, strengthening the support for this suggestive locus identified in EA women. Secondly, an investigation of SNPs in 42 previously identified menarche loci in EA women demonstrated that 25 (60%) of them contained variants significantly associated with menarche in AA women. The findings provide the first evidence of cross-ethnic generalization of menarche loci identified to date, and suggest a number of novel biological links to menarche timing in AA women.",,,8,,,

Individuals in the lowest quintile of the sport activity index of the Baecke questionnaire were categorized as low PA. Baseline BMI, waist circumference (WC), and skinfold measures were dependent variables in regression models testing the additive effect of the SNP, low PA, and their interaction, adjusting for age, alcohol use, cigarette use, educational attainment, and percent European ancestry in AA adults, stratified by sex and race/ethnicity. rs9939609 was associated with adiposity in all groups other than AA women. The SNP _ PA interaction was significant in AA men (P _ 0.002 for all traits) and EA men (P _ 0.04 for all traits). For each additional copy of the A (risk) allele, WC in AA men was higher in those with low PA (_(lowPA): 5.1_cm, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-7.5) than high PA (_(highPA): 0.7_cm, 95% CI: -0.4 to 1.9); P (interaction) = 0.002).

A large number of phospholipid and sphingolipid species can be detected and measured in human plasma. We conducted a meta-analysis of five European family-based genome-wide association studies (N_=_4034) on plasma levels of 24 sphingomyelins (SPM), 9 ceramides (CER), 57 phosphatidylcholines (PC), 20 lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), 27 phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), and 16 PE-based plasmalogens (PLPE), as well as their proportions in each major class. This effort yielded 25 genome-wide significant loci for phospholipids (smallest P-value_=_9.88_10(-204)) and 10 loci for sphingolipids (smallest P-value_=_3.10_10(-57)). After a correction for multiple comparisons (P-value< 2.2_10(-9)), we observed four novel loci significantly associated with phospholipids (PAQR9, AGPAT1, PKD2L1, PDXDC1) and two with sphingolipids (PLD2 and APOE) explaining up to 3.1% of the variance. Further analysis of the top findings with respect to within class molar proportions uncovered three additional loci for phospholipids (PNLIPRP2, PCDH20, and ABDH3) suggesting their involvement in either fatty acid elongation/saturation processes or fatty acid specific turnover mechanisms. Among those, 14 loci (KCNH7, AGPAT1, PNLIPRP2, SYT9, FADS1-2-3, DLG2, APOA1, ELOVL2, CDK17, LIPC, PDXDC1, PLD2, LASS4, and APOE) mapped into the glycerophospholipid and 12 loci (ILKAP, ITGA9, AGPAT1, FADS1-2-3, APOA1, PCDH20, LIPC, PDXDC1, SGPP1, APOE, LASS4, and PLD2) to the sphingolipid pathways. In large meta-analyses, associations between FADS1-2-3 and carotid intima media thickness, AGPAT1 and type 2 diabetes, and APOA1 and coronary artery disease were observed. In conclusion, our study identified nine novel phospho- and sphingolipid loci, substantially increasing our knowledge of the genetic basis for these traits.",,,8,,,
2672,"Associations between physical activity and postpartum depressive symptoms BACKGROUND: Postpartum women are at increased risk for developing depression, which can contribute to the ill health of the mother and her family. Previous research indicates that mothers who are physically active during leisure experience lower levels of postpartum depressive symptoms than do inactive mothers. The objective of this investigation was to examine the associations between total and domain-specific moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and depressive symptoms postpartum. METHODS: Data were obtained from 550 women who participated in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition (PIN) Postpartum Study, a prospective cohort of mothers who delivered liveborn infants from October 2002 to December 2005 in North Carolina. Three-month postpartum MVPA was investigated as a predictor of 12-month postpartum depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Those who participated in MVPA had two times the odds of developing elevated depressive symptoms at 12 months postpartum than those with no MVPA (odds ratio [OR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-6.75). Different associations were suggested when examining domain-specific MVPA. Those participating in adult and child care and indoor household MVPA at 3 months postpartum had more than double the odds of developing elevated depressive symptoms at 12 months postpartum (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.03, 8.11 and OR 2.72, 95% CI 0.96-10.18, respectively). Work MVPA conferred a doubling of the odds (OR 1.95, 95% CI 0.46-7.13), but recreational and outdoor household MVPA showed no associations with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between MVPA and depressive symptoms differed by domain among postpartum women. Future studies of postpartum depressive symptoms should explore reasons for differences in physical activity by domain.",,,9,,,
2673,"Developing the Evidence Base to Inform Best Practice: A Scoping Study of Breast and Cervical Cancer Reviews in Low- and Middle-Income Countries BACKGROUND: Breast and cervical cancers have emerged as major global health challenges and disproportionately lead to excess morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) when compared to high-income countries. The objective of this paper was to highlight key findings, recommendations, and gaps in research and practice identified through a scoping study of recent reviews in breast and cervical cancer in LMICs. METHODS: We conducted a scoping study based on the six-stage framework of Arskey and O'Malley. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, and CINAHL with the following inclusion criteria: 1) published between 2005-February 2015, 2) focused on breast or cervical cancer 3) focused on LMIC, 4) review article, and 5) published in English. RESULTS: Through our systematic search, 63 out of the 94 identified cervical cancer reviews met our selection criteria and 36 of the 54 in breast cancer. Cervical cancer reviews were more likely to focus upon prevention and screening, while breast cancer reviews were more likely to focus upon treatment and survivorship. Few of the breast cancer reviews referenced research and data from LMICs themselves; cervical cancer reviews were more likely to do so. Most reviews did not include elements of the PRISMA checklist. CONCLUSION: Overall, a limited evidence base supports breast and cervical cancer control in LMICs. Further breast and cervical cancer prevention and control studies are necessary in LMICs.",,,3,,,
2674,"Association of Impaired Glucose Regulation and Insulin Resistance With Cardiac Structure and Function: Results From ECHO-SOL (Echocardiographic Study of Latinos) BACKGROUND: We examined the relationship between glucose homeostasis and comprehensive measures of cardiac structure and function among a representative sample of US Hispanics. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECHO-SOL (Echocardiographic Study of Latinos), an echocardiographic ancillary study of the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos), enrolled 1818 Hispanic/Latino men (43%) and women (57%) aged _45 years (mean=56). Glucose intolerance was defined as follows: (1) prediabetes: hemoglobin (HbA1c) _5.7 and < 6.5% and (2) diabetes mellitus: fasting plasma glucose _126 mg/dL, 2-hour postload glucose _200 mg/dL, HbA1c _6.5%, or hypoglycemic agent use. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was defined as HbA1c _7.0%. Insulin resistance was defined using the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. Echocardiography examinations assessed left ventricular structure and systolic/diastolic function. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used. Prediabetes prevalence was 42%, and diabetes mellitus prevalence was 28% (47% uncontrolled). Glucose intolerance was associated with increased left ventricular posterior wall and interventricular septal and relative wall thicknesses (all P< 0.05), reduced ejection fraction (P< 0.01), reduced stroke and end-diastolic volumes (both P< 0.001), decreased peak E' velocity (lateral and septal P< 0.001), and increased E/E' ratio (lateral and septal P< 0.01). The odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for diastolic dysfunction among individuals with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus (versus diabetes mellitus free) were 1.36 (0.96-1.9) and 1.90 (1.3-2.8), respectively(P=0.006). Results were consistent for uncontrolled diabetes mellitus versus diabetes mellitus. Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance was associated with increased E/E' (P< 0.001), and greater relative wall thickness and septal thickness (both P< 0.05); lower stroke volume (P< 0.0001); and lower peak lateral and septal E' velocities (both P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance are associated with unfavorable cardiac structure and function, particularly worsened measures of diastolic function, even before the development of diabetes mellitus. _ 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.",,,4,,,
2675,"Sex differences in the association between depression, anxiety, and type 2 diabetes mellitus BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety have been inconsistently associated with diabetes. Sex differences in the biological and behavioral correlates of these forms of distress could partially explain these inconsistencies. We investigated sex-specific associations between depression/anxiety symptoms and diabetes in two separate samples. METHODS: The First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey enrolled 3233 participants aged 25 to 74 years from 1971 to 1974. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured via General Well Being schedule subscales. Incident diabetes for 17 years was defined by the following: a) death certificate, b) participant self-report, or c) health care facility discharge. The Detroit Neighborhood Health Study enrolled 1054 participants 18 years or older from 2008 to 2010. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 assessed depression and anxiety. Participants' self-reported physician-diagnosed prevalent diabetes. RESULTS: In the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the risk ratio (RR; 95% confidence interval) for incident diabetes among men with high versus low anxiety symptoms was 0.85 (0.56-1.29) and that among women was 2.19 (1.17-4.09; p for interaction = .005). RRs comparing high versus low depressive symptoms for men and women were 0.69 (0.43-1.100) and 2.11 (1.06-4.19); p for interaction = .007. In the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study, the RRs for prevalent diabetes comparing those with high versus low anxiety symptoms were 0.24 (0.02-2.42) for men and 1.62 (0.61-4.32) for women (p for interaction = < .001), whereas RRs for depression were 1.30 (0.46-3.68) for men and 2.32 (1.10-4.89) for women (p for interaction = .16). CONCLUSIONS: In two separate samples, depressive symptoms were related to increased diabetes risk among women but not men. Although less robust, findings for anxiety were differentially associated with diabetes by sex.",,,4,,,
2676,"Association of the home environment with cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers in youth OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the home environment and biomarkers associated with the cardiovascular and metabolic risks in adolescents. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-eight adolescents (185 males and 173 females) living in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota, between the ages of 10-17 years agreed to participate. Data were collected from August 2006 through March 2008. A fasting blood sample was drawn and assayed for insulin, glucose and lipids. Resting blood pressure, percent body fat (PBF) and body mass index were also measured. The home environment was assessed using a self-report of physical activity (PA) and media inventory (PAMI) completed by the parents. Density of PA and media equipment was calculated by summing the number of items present in the home and dividing by the total number of locations in the home. PA and screen media density were modeled as independent variables. RESULTS: Our results found that the density of PA equipment was negatively associated with insulin levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol, insulin resistance, and PBF. Media density was positively associated with insulin, LDL, total cholesterol, and PBF. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the home environment is associated with metabolic and cardiovascular health in adolescents. Copyright _ 2010 Elsevier Inc.

2677,"Youth engagement in developing an implementation science research agenda on adolescent HIV testing and care linkages in sub-Saharan Africa BACKGROUND: The importance of youth engagement in designing, implementing and evaluating programs has garnered more attention as international initiatives seek to address the HIV crisis among this population. Adolescents, however, are not often included in HIV implementation science research and have not had opportunities to contribute to the development of HIV-related research agendas. Project Supporting Operational AIDS Research (SOAR), a United States Agency for International Development-funded global operations research project, involved youth living with HIV in a meeting to develop a strategic implementation science research agenda to improve adolescent HIV care continuum outcomes, including HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and linkage to care. METHODS: Project SOAR convened a 2-day meeting of 50 experts, including four youth living with HIV. Participants examined the literature, developed research questions, and voted to prioritize these questions for the implementation science research agenda. This article presents the process of involving youth, how they shaped the course of discussions, and the resulting priority research gaps identified at the meeting. RESULTS: Youth participation influenced working group discussions and the development of the implementation science agenda. Research gaps identified included how to engage vulnerable adolescents, determining the role that stigma, peers, and self-testing have in shaping adolescent HTC behaviors, and examining the costs of different HTC and linkage to care strategies. CONCLUSION: The meeting participants developed the research agenda to guide future implementation science research to improve HIV outcomes among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. This process highlighted the importance of youth in shaping implementation science research agendas and the need for greater youth engagement.",,,6,,,
2678,"Coronaviruses: an RNA proofreading machine regulates replication fidelity and diversity In order to survive and propagate, RNA viruses must achieve a balance between the capacity for adaptation to new environmental conditions or host cells with the need to maintain an intact and replication competent genome. Several virus families in the order Nidovirales, such as the coronaviruses (CoVs) must achieve these objectives with the largest and most complex replicating RNA genomes known, up to 32 kb of positive-sense RNA. The CoVs encode sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp 1-16) with known or predicted RNA synthesis and modification activities, and it has been proposed that they are also responsible for the evolution of large genomes. The CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, encode a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity (ExoN) in nsp14. Genetic inactivation of ExoN activity in engineered SARS-CoV and MHV genomes by alanine substitution at conserved DE-D-D active site residues results in viable mutants that demonstrate 15- to 20-fold increases in mutation rates, up to 18 times greater than those tolerated for fidelity mutants of other RNA viruses. Thus nsp14-ExoN is essential for replication fidelity, and likely serves either as a direct mediator or regulator of a more complex RNA proofreading machine, a process previously unprecedented in RNA virus biology. Elucidation of the mechanisms of nsp14-mediated proofreading will have major implications for our understanding of the evolution of RNA viruses, and also will provide a robust model to investigate the balance between fidelity, diversity and pathogenesis. The discovery of a protein distinct from a viral RdRp that regulates replication fidelity also raises the possibility that RNA genome replication fidelity may be adaptable to differing replication environments and selective pressures, rather than being a fixed determinant.",,,1,,,
2679,"""You're in a world of chaos"": experiences accessing HIV care and adhering to medications after incarceration Most HIV-infected inmates leave prison with a suppressed viral load; many, however, become disconnected from care and nonadherent to medications during reentry to community life. In this secondary data analysis of focus groups (n = 6) and in-depth interviews (n = 9) with 46 formerly incarcerated HIV-infected people during reentry, we used an inductive analytic approach to explore the interplay between individual, interpersonal, community, and structural factors and HIV management. Participants described barriers and facilitators to care engagement and adherence at each of these four levels, as well as a milieu of HIV and incarceration-related stigma and discrimination. The constellation of barriers and facilitators created competing demands and a sense of chaos in participants' lives, which led them to address reentry-related basic needs (e.g., housing, food) before health care needs. Interventions that simultaneously address multiple levels, including augmenting employment and housing opportunities, enhancing social support, and reducing stigma, are needed.

2680,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Transmission Among Persons With Acute HIV-1 Infection in Malawi: Demographic, Behavioral, and Phylogenetic Relationships BACKGROUND: Understanding sexual networks involving acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infections (AHI) may lead to prevention opportunities to mitigate high rates of onward transmission. We evaluated HIV-1 phylogenetic and behavioral characteristics among persons with AHI and their referred partners. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2014, 46 persons with AHI in Malawi participated in a combined behavioral and biomedical intervention. Participants referred sexual partners by passive referral. Demographics and sexual behaviors were collected through interviews and HIV-1 genetic relationships were assessed with phylogenetics. RESULTS: Among 45 AHI participants with HIV-1 sequences, none was phylogenetically-linked with another AHI index. There were 19 (42%) AHI participants who referred a single partner that returned for testing. Most partners (n = 17) were HIV-infected, with 15 (88%) presenting with an established infection. There were 14 index-partner pairs that had sequences available; 13 (93%) pairs were phylogenetically-linked dyads. The AHI index was female in 7/13 (54%) dyads. Age-disparate relationships among dyads were common (_5-year age difference in 67% of dyads), including 3/6 dyads involving a male index and a younger woman. Index participants with a referred partner were more likely to report no casual partners and to be living with their current partner than participants not in dyads. CONCLUSIONS: Passive-partner referral successfully identified partners with genetically-similar HIV infections-the likely source of infection-but only 40% of index cases referred partners who presented for HIV-1 testing. Future work evaluating assisted partner notification may help reach susceptible partners or more people with untreated HIV-1 infections connected to acute transmission.

2681,"Phylogenetic studies of transmission dynamics in generalized HIV epidemics: an essential tool where the burden is greatest? Efficient and effective HIV prevention measures for generalized epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa have not yet been validated at the population level. Design and impact evaluation of such measures requires fine-scale understanding of local HIV transmission dynamics. The novel tools of HIV phylogenetics and molecular epidemiology may elucidate these transmission dynamics. Such methods have been incorporated into studies of concentrated HIV epidemics to identify proximate and determinant traits associated with ongoing transmission. However, applying similar phylogenetic analyses to generalized epidemics, including the design and evaluation of prevention trials, presents additional challenges. Here we review the scope of these methods and present examples of their use in concentrated epidemics in the context of prevention. Next, we describe the current uses for phylogenetics in generalized epidemics and discuss their promise for elucidating transmission patterns and informing prevention trials. Finally, we review logistic and technical challenges inherent to large-scale molecular epidemiological studies of generalized epidemics and suggest potential solutions.",,,6,,,
2682,"Phylogenetic insights into regional HIV transmission OBJECTIVES: Despite prevention efforts, new HIV diagnoses continue in the southern United States, where the epidemic is characterized by significant racial/ethnic disparities. We integrated phylogenetic analyses with clinical data to reveal trends in local HIV transmission. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 1671 HIV-infected individuals each with one B-subtype pol sequence obtained during chronic (82%; UNC Center for AIDS Research Clinical Cohort) or acute/recent (18%; Duke/UNC Acute HIV Consortium) infection. METHODS: Phylogenies were inferred using neighbor joining to select related sequences then confirmed with Bayesian methods. We characterized transmission clusters (clades n _ 3 sequences supported by posterior probabilities = 1) by factors including race/ethnicity and transmission risk. Factors associated with cluster membership were evaluated for newly diagnosed patients. RESULTS: Overall, 72% were men, 59% black and 39% men who have sex with men (MSM). A total of 557 (33%) sequences grouped in either 108 pairs (n = 216) or 67 clusters (n = 341). Clusters ranged from three to 36 (median 4) members. Composition was delineated primarily by race, with 28% exclusively black, and to a lesser extent by risk group. Both MSM and heterosexuals formed discrete clusters, although substantial mixing was observed. In multivariable analysis, patients with age 30 years or less (P = 0.009), acute infection (P = 0.02), local residence (P = 0.002) and transmitted drug resistance (P = 0.02) were more likely to be cluster members, whereas Latinos were less likely (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Integration of molecular, clinical and demographic data offers a unique view into the structure of local transmission networks. Clustering by black race, youth and transmitted drug resistance and inability to identify Latino clusters will inform prevention, testing and linkage to care strategies.",,,6,,,
2683,"HIV transmission patterns among immigrant latinos illuminated by the integration of phylogenetic and migration data Latinos represent a growing proportion of HIV cases in North Carolina (NC). Understanding how immigrants are involved in local HIV transmission is important to guide interventions. We used phylogenetics to characterize Latino involvement in local HIV transmission chains. Transmission clusters were identified from maximum-likelihood phylogenies constructed with HIV pol sequences from 177 Latinos and 1,496 non-Latinos receiving care in NC. Highly supported clusters involving one or more Latinos were characterized. Migration data were obtained from interviews and chart review. Factors associated with cluster membership were identified using log-binomial regression. Most Latinos were male (76%), immigrants (83%), and had HIV-1B (99%). Immigrants were more likely to report heterosexual risk (67% vs. 23%) than U.S.-born Latinos (p_< _0.01). We identified 32 clusters that included one or more Latinos; these involved 53 Latinos (30%) and 41 non-Latinos. Immigrant and U.S.-born Latinos were equally likely to be in clusters, but immigrants were more likely to be in clusters with another Latino (78% vs. 29%; p_=_0.02). Cluster composition by ethnicity and risk behavior varied by cluster size; larger clusters contained fewer immigrants and more men who have sex with men (MSM). Factors associated with immigrant membership in local transmission clusters included age < 30 years [RR 2.34 (95% CI 1.47-3.73)], Mexican origin [RR 2.55 (95% CI 1.29-6.88)], and residing in the United States longer before diagnosis [RR 1.53 (95% CI 1.09-2.15), per 10 years]. While some Latinos immigrate with HIV infection, many immigrants are involved in transmission networks after arrival, particularly MSM. HIV testing and prevention interventions must consider this heterogeneity and may be better targeted by integrating phylogenetic analyses.",,,6,,,
2684,"Late entry to HIV care among Latinos compared with non-Latinos in a southeastern US cohort BACKGROUND: Late diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains common despite advances in therapy and prognosis. The southeastern United States is a rapidly growing Latino settlement area where ethnic disparities may contribute to late presentation to care. METHODS: We assessed demographic and clinical factors between racial/ethnic groups at the time of HIV care initiation in the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research Clinical Cohort. We identified independent predictors of late presentation, defined as a CD4(+) T lymphocyte (CD4) count < 350 cells/mm(3) or an AIDS-defining event (ADE), using log-linear binomial regression. RESULTS: During the period 1999-2009, 853 patients initiated HIV care, of whom 11% were Latino, 28% were white, and 61% were black. Median initial CD4 counts were lower for Latino patients (186 cells/mm(3)) than white patients (292 cells/mm(3); P = .006) and black patients (302 cells/mm(3); P = .02). Latino persons were more likely to be late presenters than white or black persons (76% vs 58%; P < .001) and accounted for 86%, 75%, and 50% of all presenting cases of active tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and toxoplasmosis, respectively. Latino ethnicity, older age, male sex, and earlier entry year were independently associated with late presentation (P < .05 for all). In multivariable analyses, Latino persons were 1.29 times more likely to present to care late than white or black persons (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Latinos are more likely to initiate HIV care later in the course of illness than are black and white persons and account for a majority of several ADEs. Strategies to improve earlier HIV testing among Latinos in new settlement areas are needed.",,,5,,,
2685,"HIV risk behaviors and sociodemographic features of HIV-infected Latinos residing in a new Latino settlement area in the Southeastern United States The Southeastern United States (US) has a rapidly growing Latino population, yet little is known about HIV-infected Latinos in the region. To help inform future prevention studies, we compared sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics between immigrant and US-born HIV-infected Latinos using face-to-face interviews conducted at three clinics in North Carolina. Questions encompassed HIV testing, acculturation, sexual- and substance-related behaviors, and migration history. Behavioral data were compared with 451 black and white clinic patients. Differences were tested using Pearson's and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Participants (n = 127) were primarily male (74%) and immigrants (82%). Most immigrants were Mexican (67%), had low acculturation scores (92%), and were diagnosed a median of 8 years (IQR 0-12) following immigration. Compared with US-born Latinos, immigrants had lower CD4 counts at clinic entry (median 187 vs. 371 cells/mm(3)) and were less likely to have graduated high school (49% vs. 78%) or have insurance (9% vs. 52%; all P < 0.05). Most immigrants identified as heterosexual (60%) and reported fewer lifetime partners than US-born Latinos (median 6 vs. 20; P = 0.001). Immigrant men were less likely to report sex with men than US-born men (43% vs. 81%; P = 0.005). Immigrant men also had similar risk behaviors to black men, and US-born Latino men exhibited behaviors that were more similar to white men in our clinic. At the time of survey, >90% of participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and most had achieved HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL (62% immigrants vs. 76% US-born; P = 0.32). In conclusion, Latino immigrants were more likely to present with advanced disease, identify as heterosexual, and report different risk behaviors than US-born Latinos, yet receipt and response to ART were similar between the two groups. Prevention strategies should prioritize finding innovative methods to reach Latino immigrants for routine early testing regardless of risk stratification and include programs targeted toward the different needs of immigrant and US-born Latinos.",,,6,,,

2687,"The importance of the biological impact of exposure to the concept of the exposome BACKGROUND: The term ""exposome"" was originally coined in 2005 and defined as the totality of exposures throughout the lifetime. The exposome provides an excellent scientific framework for studying human health and disease. Recently, it has been suggested that how exposures affect our biology and how our bodies respond to such exposures should be part of the exposome. OBJECTIVES: The authors describe the biological impact of the exposome and outline many of the targets and processes that can be assessed as part of a comprehensive analysis of the exposome. DISCUSSION: The processes that occur downstream from the initial interactions with exogenous and endogenous compounds determine the biological impact of exposures. If the effects are not considered in the same context as the exposures, it will be difficult to determine cause and effect. The exposome and biology are interactive-changes in biology due to the environment change one's vulnerability to subsequent exposures. Additionally, highly resilient individuals are able to withstand environmental exposures with minimal effects to their health. We expect that the vast majority of exposures are transient, and chemicals underlying exposures that occurred weeks, months, or years ago are long gone from the body. However, these past chemical exposures often leave molecular fingerprints that may be able to provide information on these past exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Through linking exposures to specific biological responses, exposome research could serve to improve understanding of the mechanistic connections between exposures and health to help mitigate adverse health outcomes across the lifespan.

2688,"Coadministration of CH31 Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Does Not Affect Development of Vaccine-Induced Anti-HIV-1 Envelope Antibody Responses in Infant Rhesus Macaques Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is an indispensable component in combatting the global AIDS epidemic. A combination of passive broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) infusion and active vaccination promises to provide protection of infants against MTCT from birth through the breastfeeding period and could prime the immune system for lifelong immunity. In this study, we investigate the impact of a single infusion of CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bnAb administered at birth on de novo antibody responses elicited by concurrent active HIV envelope vaccination. Four groups of infant macaques received active immunizations with subunit Env protein or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-vectored Env and subunit Env protein, with or without a single intravenous coadministration of CH31 bnAb at birth. Vaccinated animals were monitored to evaluate binding and functional antibody responses elicited by the active vaccinations. Despite achieving plasma concentrations that were able to neutralize tier 2 viruses, coadministration of CH31 did not have a large impact on the kinetics, magnitude, specificity, or avidity of vaccine-elicited binding or functional antibody responses, including epitope specificity, the development of CD4bs antibodies, neutralization, binding to infected cells, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We conclude that infusion of CD4bs bnAb CH31 at birth does not interfere with de novo antibody responses to active vaccination and that a combination of passive bnAb infusion and active HIV-1 Env vaccination is a viable strategy for immediate and prolonged protection against MTCT.IMPORTANCE Our study is the first to evaluate the impact of passive infusion of a broadly neutralizing antibody in newborns on the de novo development of antibody responses following active vaccinations in infancy. We demonstrated the safety and the feasibility of bnAb administration to achieve biologically relevant levels of the antibody and showed that the passive infusion did not impair the de novo antibody production following HIV-1 Env vaccination. Our study paves the way for further investigations of the combination strategy using passive plus active immunization to provide protection of infants born to HIV-1-positive mothers over the entire period of risk for mother-to-child transmission.

2689,"Improvements to water purification and sanitation infrastructure may reduce the diarrheal burden in a marginalized and flood prone population in remote Nicaragua BACKGROUND: The isolated northern region of Nicaragua has one of the highest rates of diarrheal disease in Central America. Political and environmental hardships faced by inhabitants of this region are contributing factors to this health inequity. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between water and latrine infrastructure and the prevalence of diarrhea in this region. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional survey of women of reproductive age was conducted in the Sahsa region of northern Nicaragua in July, 2009. Households were selected by two stage cluster sampling methodology. A questionnaire was administered in Spanish and Miskito with assessment of household and socioeconomic conditions, sanitation practices, and health care access. Diarrhea prevalence differences at the household level over a two week reporting period were estimated with a standardized instrument which included assessment of water treatment and latrine use and maintenance. RESULTS: There were 189 women enrolled in the current study. The use of water purification methods, such as chlorine and filters, and latrine ownership were not associated with reduced prevalence of household diarrhea in the two week reporting period. Latrine overflow, however, was associated with an increased prevalence of diarrhea during the same two week period [adjusted prevalence difference and 95% CI: 0.19 (0.03, 0.36)]. CONCLUSIONS: Simple, low cost interventions that improve water and latrine infrastructure may reduce the prevalence of diarrheal disease in the isolated regions of Nicaragua and Central America.",,,1,,,

METHOD: Data on all reported invasive cervical cancer cases from 1998 to 2007 were obtained from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. Age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates were estimated using population data from the National Center for Health Statistics. RESULTS: Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates varied greatly by county and were inversely associated with county prosperity. Hispanic women had the highest incidence rate, black women the highest mortality rate, although white women accounted for most cases. Incidence rates remained fairly steady above age 35 and mortality rates steadily increased with age. A later stage at diagnosis was more common for older women and for women without private insurance. CONCLUSION: Registry-based assessment illustrates the economic, racial, and age disparities associated with cervical cancer. This localized focus on demographic correlates is an important step toward eliminating this preventable disease and offers a template for cervical cancer prevention programs in other states.

2691,"Bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor for high-grade cervical lesions and cancer in HIV-seropositive women OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) among HIV-seropositive women. METHODS: A hospital-based prospective cohort study of HIV-seropositive women was conducted in Johannesburg, South Africa from January 2005 to September 2009. Multivariate log-binomial and Poisson regressions were used to estimate prevalence and rate ratios, respectively. RESULTS: Among 1954 HIV-seropositive women, the baseline prevalence of HSIL was 17%. BV prevalence was high (54%) and showed no association with prevalence of HSIL (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.92-1.35) nor with cervical lesion progression at follow-up visit (n=503) (adjusted rate ratio: 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65-1.53). CONCLUSION: Among HIV-seropositive women, BV was not associated with an increased risk of HSIL or cervical lesion progression. Copyright _ 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,6,,,
2692,"Common genetic variation near the connexin-43 gene is associated with resting heart rate in African Americans: a genome-wide association study of 13,372 participants BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic loci associated with variation in resting heart rate in European and Asian populations. No study has evaluated genetic variants associated with heart rate in African Americans. OBJECTIVE: To identify novel genetic variants associated with resting heart rate in African Americans. METHODS: Ten cohort studies participating in the Candidate-gene Association Resource and Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network consortia performed genome-wide genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed 2,954,965 SNPs using HapMap YRI and CEU panels in 13,372 participants of African ancestry. Each study measured the RR interval (ms) from 10-second resting 12-lead electrocardiograms and estimated RR-SNP associations using covariate-adjusted linear regression. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to combine cohort-specific measures of association and identify genome-wide significant loci (P_2.5_10(-8)). RESULTS: Fourteen SNPs on chromosome 6q22 exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold. The most significant association was for rs9320841 (+13 ms per minor allele; P = 4.98_10(-15)). This SNP was approximately 350 kb downstream of GJA1, a locus previously identified as harboring SNPs associated with heart rate in Europeans. Adjustment for rs9320841 also attenuated the association between the remaining 13 SNPs in this region and heart rate. In addition, SNPs in MYH6, which have been identified in European genome-wide association study, were associated with similar changes in the resting heart rate as this population of African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: An intergenic region downstream of GJA1 (the gene encoding connexin 43, the major protein of the human myocardial gap junction) and an intragenic region within MYH6 are associated with variation in resting heart rate in African Americans as well as in populations of European and Asian origin.

2693,"Variant hemoglobin phenotypes may account for differential erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dosing in African-American hemodialysis patients African-American patients with end-stage renal disease have historically lower hemoglobin concentrations and higher requirements of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). While disparities in health-care access may partially explain these findings, the role of variant hemoglobin, such as sickle trait, has not been investigated. To clarify this, we evaluated 154 African-American patients receiving in-center hemodialysis with available hemoglobin phenotyping. The primary exposure was any abnormal hemoglobin variant and the primary outcome of higher-dose ESA was defined as a dose of 6500 or more units per treatment. Logistic regression assessed the association between variant hemoglobin and higher-dose ESA. Covariates included age, gender, diabetes, iron parameters, intravenous iron dose, parathyroid hormone, albumin, phosphorus, body mass index, vascular access type, hospitalization/missed treatments, smoking status, alcohol abuse, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Of 33 patients with variant hemoglobin, 24 had HbAS and 9 had HbAC. Univariate odds of higher-dose ESA among those with hemoglobin variants were twice that of those with the normal HbAA phenotype (odds ratio 2.05). In multivariate models, the likelihood of higher-dose ESA had an odds ratio of 3.31 and the nature of this relationship did not change in Poisson regression or sensitivity analyses. Hence, our findings may explain, in part, the difference in ESA dosing between Caucasians and African-Americans with end-stage renal disease but await further study.",,,3,,,
2694,"Rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate is common in adults with sickle cell disease and associated with increased mortality We evaluated the prevalence of rapid decline in kidney function, its potential risk factors and influence upon mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) in a retrospective single-center study. Rapid decline of kidney function was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss of >3_0_ml/min/1_73_m2 per year. A multivariable logistic regression model for rapid eGFR decline was constructed after evaluating individual covariates. We constructed multivariate Cox-regression models for rapid eGFR decline and mortality. Among 331 SCD patients (median age 29_years [interquartile range, IQR: 20, 41]; 187 [56_5%] female) followed for median 4_01_years (IQR: 1_66, 7_19), rapid eGFR decline was noted in 103 (31_1%). History of stroke (odds ratio [OR]: 2_91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1_25-6_77) and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (OR: 3_17, 95% CI: 1_28-7_84) were associated with rapid eGFR decline. The rate of eGFR change over time was associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0_99, 95% CI: 0_984-0_995, P_=_0_0002). In Cox-regression, rapid eGFR decline associated with mortality (HR: 2_07, 95% CI: 1_039-4_138, P_=_0_04) adjusting for age, sex and history of stroke. Rapid eGFR decline is common in SCD and associated with increased mortality. Long-term studies are needed to determine whether attenuating loss of kidney function may decrease mortality in SCD. _ 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,3,,,
2695,"Investigation of the genetic association between quantitative measures of psychosis and schizophrenia: a polygenic risk score analysis The presence of subclinical levels of psychosis in the general population may imply that schizophrenia is the extreme expression of more or less continuously distributed traits in the population. In a previous study, we identified five quantitative measures of schizophrenia (positive, negative, disorganisation, mania, and depression scores). The aim of this study is to examine the association between a direct measure of genetic risk of schizophrenia and the five quantitative measures of psychosis. Estimates of the log of the odds ratios of case/control allelic association tests were obtained from the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium (PGC) (minus our sample) which included genome-wide genotype data of 8,690 schizophrenia cases and 11,831 controls. These data were used to calculate genetic risk scores in 314 schizophrenia cases and 148 controls from the Netherlands for whom genotype data and quantitative symptom scores were available. The genetic risk score of schizophrenia was significantly associated with case-control status (p< 0.0001). In the case-control sample, the five psychosis dimensions were found to be significantly associated with genetic risk scores; the correlations ranged between.15 and.27 (all p< .001). However, these correlations were not significant in schizophrenia cases or controls separately. While this study confirms the presence of a genetic risk for schizophrenia as categorical diagnostic trait, we did not find evidence for the genetic risk underlying quantitative schizophrenia symptom dimensions. This does not necessarily imply that a genetic basis is nonexistent, but does suggest that it is distinct from the polygenic risk score for schizophrenia.",,,1,,,
2696,"Home Self-Collection by Mail to Test for Human Papillomavirus and Sexually Transmitted Infections OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and acceptability of at-home self-collection to test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and sexually transmitted infections among women overdue for cervical cancer screening by national guidelines. METHODS: Low-income, infrequently screened women were recruited from the general population in North Carolina to participate in an observational study. Participants provided two self-collected cervicovaginal samples (one at home and one in the clinic) and a clinician-collected cervical sample. Samples were tested for high-risk HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Cervical samples were also tested by liquid-based cytology. RESULTS: Overall, 193 women had conclusive high-risk HPV results for all three samples and cytology results. Prevalence of high-risk HPV within self-home samples (12.4%) was not different from that within clinician samples (11.4%; P=.79) and from that within self clinic samples (15.5%; P=.21). Positivity for high-risk HPV in all sample types increased with increasing grades of cervical abnormality (P< .001). Self-home samples detected high-risk HPV in all identified cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse. Detection was comparable across sample types for T vaginalis (range 10.2-10.8%), M genitalium (3.3-5.5%), C trachomatis (1.1-2.1%), and N gonorrhoeae (0-0.5%). Kappa values between sample types ranged from 0.56 to 0.66 for high-risk HPV, 0.86-0.91 for T vaginalis, and 0.65-0.83 for M genitalium. Most participants reported no difficulty understanding self-collection instructions (93.6%) and were willing to use self-collection in the future (96.3%). CONCLUSION: Mail-based, at-home self-collection for high-risk HPV and sexually transmitted infection detection was valid and well accepted among infrequently screened women in our study. These findings support the future use of high-risk HPV self-collection to increase cervical cancer screening rates among higher risk women in the United States.",,,0,,,
2697,"Impact of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine Resistance on Effectiveness of Intermittent Preventive Therapy for Malaria in Pregnancy at Clearing Infections and Preventing Low Birth Weight BACKGROUND: Owing to increasing sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in sub-Saharan Africa, monitoring the effectiveness of intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy (IPTp) with SP is crucial. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, both the efficacy of IPTp-SP at clearing existing peripheral malaria infections and the effectiveness of IPTp-SP at reducing low birth weight (LBW) were assessed among human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected participants in 8 sites in 6 countries. Sites were classified as high, medium, or low resistance after measuring parasite mutations conferring SP resistance. An individual-level prospective pooled analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Among 1222 parasitemic pregnant women, overall polymerase chain reaction-uncorrected and -corrected failure rates by day 42 were 21.3% and 10.0%, respectively (39.7% and 21.1% in high-resistance areas; 4.9% and 1.1% in low-resistance areas). Median time to recurrence decreased with increasing prevalence of Pfdhps-K540E. Among 6099 women at delivery, IPTp-SP was associated with a 22% reduction in the risk of LBW (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], .69-.88; P < .001). This association was not modified by insecticide-treated net use or gravidity, and remained significant in areas with high SP resistance (PR, 0.81; 95% CI, .67-.97; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of SP to clear peripheral parasites and prevent new infections during pregnancy is compromised in areas with >90% prevalence of Pfdhps-K540E. Nevertheless, in these high-resistance areas, IPTp-SP use remains associated with increases in birth weight and maternal hemoglobin. The effectiveness of IPTp in eastern and southern Africa is threatened by further increases in SP resistance and reinforces the need to evaluate alternative drugs and strategies for the control of malaria in pregnancy.

2698,"Analgesic medication errors in North Carolina nursing homes The objective of this study was to characterize analgesic medication errors and to evaluate their association with patient harm. The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of individual medication error incidents reported by North Carolina nursing homes to the Medication Error Quality Initiative (MEQI) during fiscal years 2010-2011. Bivariate associations between analgesic medication errors with patient factors, error-related factors, and impact on patients were tested with chi-square tests. A multivariate logistic regression model explored the relationship between type of analgesic medication errors and patient harm, controlling for patient- and error-related factors. A total of 32,176 individual medication error incidents were reported over a 2-year period in North Carolina nursing homes, 12.3% (n = 3949) of which were analgesic medication errors. Of these analgesic medication errors, opioid and nonopioid analgesics were involved in 3105 and 844 errors, respectively. Opioid errors were more likely to be wrong drug errors, wrong dose errors, and administration errors compared with nonopioid errors (P < .0001 for all comparisons). In the multivariate model, opioid errors were found to have higher odds of patient harm compared with nonopioid errors (odds ratio [OR] = 3, 95% confodence interval [CI]: 1.1-7.8). The authors conclude that opioid analgesics represent the majority of analgesic error reports, and these error reports reflect an increased likelihood of patient harm compared with nonopioid analgesics.",,,2,,,
2699,"Associations of salivary cortisol levels with inflammatory markers: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Socioeconomic and psychosocial factors have been found to be associated with systemic inflammation. Although stress is often proposed as a contributor to these associations, no population studies have investigated the links between inflammation and biomarkers of stress. The current study examines associations between daily cortisol profiles and inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) in a population-based sample of 869 adults with repeat measures of cortisol over multiple days. Persons with higher levels of IL-6 had a less pronounced cortisol awakening response, a less steep daily decline, and higher cortisol area under the curve for the day with associations persisting after controls for risk factors and other cytokines. Persons with higher levels of TNF-a had lower cortisol levels upon waking, and flatter daily decline, although associations with decline were attenuated when controlling for inflammatory risk factors. Higher levels of IL-10 were associated with marginally flatter daily cortisol decline (p< .10). This study is the first to identify associations of basal cortisol activity and inflammatory markers in a population based sample. Findings are consistent with the possibility that HPA axis activity may mediate associations between psychosocial stressors and inflammatory processes. Additional prospective data are necessary to clarify the directionality of associations between cortisol and inflammatory markers. Copyright _ 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,1,,,
2700,"Maternal occupational exposure to organic solvents during early pregnancy and risks of neural tube defects and orofacial clefts OBJECTIVES: Though toxicological experiments demonstrate the teratogenicity of organic solvents in animal models, epidemiologic studies have reported inconsistent results. Using data from the population-based National Birth Defects Prevention Study, the authors examined the relation between maternal occupational exposure to aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents and Stoddard solvent during early pregnancy and neural tube defects (NTDs) and orofacial clefts (OFCs). METHODS: Cases of NTDs (anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocoele) and OFCs (cleft lip _ cleft palate and cleft palate alone) delivered between 1997 and 2002 were identified by birth defect surveillance registries in eight states; non-malformed control infants were selected using birth certificates or hospital records. Maternal solvent exposure was estimated by industrial hygienist review of self-reported occupational histories in combination with a literature-derived exposure database. ORs and 95% CIs for the association between solvent class and each birth defect group and component phenotype were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, folic acid supplement use and smoking. RESULTS: The prevalence of exposure to any solvent among mothers of NTD cases (n = 511), OFC cases (n = 1163) and controls (n = 2977) was 13.1%, 9.6% and 8.2%, respectively. Exposure to chlorinated solvents was associated with increased odds of NTDs (OR = 1.96, CI 1.34 to 2.87), especially spina bifida (OR = 2.26, CI 1.44 to 3.53). No solvent class was strongly associated with OFCs in these data. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that maternal occupational exposure to chlorinated solvents during early pregnancy is positively associated with the prevalence of NTDs in offspring.",,,3,,,
2701,"Assessed occupational exposure to chlorinated, aromatic and Stoddard solvents during pregnancy and risk of fetal growth restriction OBJECTIVES: Previous experimental and epidemiological research suggests that maternal exposure to some organic solvents during pregnancy may increase the risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR). We evaluated the association between expert-assessed occupational solvent exposure and risk of small for gestational age (SGA) infants in a population-based sample of women in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. METHODS: We analysed data from 2886 mothers and their infants born between 1997 and 2002. Job histories were self-reported. Probability of exposure to six chlorinated, three aromatic and one petroleum solvent was assessed by industrial hygienists. SGA was defined as birthweight< 10th centile of birthweight-by-gestational age in a national reference. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs to assess the association between SGA and exposure to any solvent(s) or specific solvent classes, adjusting for maternal age and education. RESULTS: Approximately 8% of infants were SGA. Exposure prevalence to any solvent was 10% and 8% among mothers of SGA and non-SGA infants, respectively. Among women with _ 50% probability of exposure, we observed elevated but imprecise associations between SGA and exposure to any solvent(s) (1.71; 0.86 to 3.40), chlorinated solvents (1.70; 0.69 to 4.01) and aromatic solvents (1.87; 0.78 to 4.50). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study in the USA to investigate the potential association between FGR and assessed maternal occupational exposure to distinct classes of organic solvents during pregnancy. The potential associations observed between SGA and exposure to chlorinated and aromatic solvents are based on small numbers and merit further investigation.
