1000,"Urban Growth Dynamics and Changing Land-Use Land-Cover of Megacity Kolkata and Its Environs Spatio-temporal land-use land-cover changes have a long-term impact on urban environments. The present study is based on land-use land-cover changes and urban expansion of megacity Kolkata and its environs over three decades (1991-2018) using multitemporal Landsat data. The study aims to explore and explain the spatio-temporal land-use land-cover change, areal differentiation, spatio-temporal urban growth trajectory and future land-use land-cover prediction with population projection. The spatio-temporal representation found rapid urbanization, i.e. 19% to 57%, exactly three times as in 1991, resulting in significant loss of other than urban/built-up area. Urban trajectory reveals that the expansion mainly occurred in north-east to south-west direction, the zone of both sides of River Hooghly. Areal differentiation map with highest urbanization (3146 ha or UII = 0.64) was identified in the north-north-west part, while least urbanization was identified in the east-north-east direction. On the other hand, this urbanization has grabbed most (i.e. 87%) of the areas within 5-km ring buffer compared to other three ring buffers. Being Kolkata as a traditional city, it has all modern facilities since British rule; as a result, the high population growth and rapid urban expansion were explored in the study. Therefore, urban growth led to radical changes in land-use land-cover, which were witnessed by sharp decreases in sparse vegetation and fallow land. The correlation explained that increasing urbanization has decreased the amount of water body and vegetation. The future prediction graph identified the more horrible picture: the city and its environs will be covered by 67% built-up, while there will be only 3% water body, 14% vegetation and 16% fallow land of the total geographical area with a population (projection) of 28 million in 2051 if it is continued. Such expansion will create a wide range of mismanagement and environmental problems. Hence, the intensive explanation and areal differentiation maps and diagrams prepared using geospatial data will definitely help to understand the urban growth dynamics process and changing form of land-use land-cover and simultaneously decision-making process of the local planners, stakeholders and academicians. Therefore, it also guides to future planning to decrease the adverse effects of urbanization and result in the form of land-use land-cover and makes an eco-friendly megacity as well as sustainable urban development too.",
1001,"Reduction in exposure to arsenic from drinking well-water in Bangladesh limited by insufficient testing and awareness This study considers potential policy responses to the still very high levels of exposure to arsenic (As) caused by drinking water from shallow tubewells in rural Bangladesh. It examines a survey of 4,109 households in 76 villages of Araihazar upazila conducted two years after a national testing campaign swept through the area. The area is adjacent to the region where a long-term study was initiated in 2000 and where households are periodically reminded of health risks associated with well-water elevated in As. Results confirm that testing spurs switching away from unsafe wells, although the 27% fraction who switched was only about half of that in the long-term study area. By village, the fraction of households that switched varied with the availability of safe wells and the distance from the long-term study area. Lacking follow-up testing, two years only after the campaign 21% of households did not know the status of their well and 21% of households with an unsafe well that switched did so to an untested well. Well testing is again urgently needed in Bangladesh and should be paired with better ways to raise awareness and the installation of additional deep community wells.",1
1002,"Optimization of phenol adsorption onto biochar from oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) Malaysia, as one of the leading palm oil producers in the world faces problems in disposal of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB), which can be converted into various value-added products, including adsorbents. This study investigated the adsorption of phenol from its solution using biochar produced from EFB through carbonization. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with Box-Behnken design was used to investigate the effects of three parameters (temperature, time and heating rate) during carbonization on phenol removal by the biochar produced. This was followed by process optimization based on statistical analysis. The results indicated that the optimized carbonization conditions were; 500 degrees C for temperature, 10 degrees C/min of heating rate and 80 min for reaction tim which led to 7.57% of phenol removal. SEM revealed coarse and uneven surface of the biochar surface, with small degree of pore development. Comparison between FTIR spectrum of EFB and biochar revealed the loss water and hydroxyl compounds from EFB during carbonization. The lack of oxygenated groups (especially carbonyl groups) on the adsorbent surface as well as limited number of pores were the possible reasons leading to low phenol adsorption by biochar, therefore conversion of the biochar to activated carbon was necessary for higher adsorption performance.",
1003,"Long-term trends in hydrochemistry in the Paraiba do Sul River, southeastern Brazil The Paraiba do Sul watershed is an important hydrological resource for southeastern Brazil, that has undergone extensive land use changes related to industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Over 11 years, between 1997 and 2007, a long-term study was conducted to evaluate hydrochemical variation in the basin outlet through estimations of annual fluxes and identification of their controlling factors. River water was classified as Na-HCO3, with TDS ranging from 32 to 132 mg L-1. Variation between seasons was found: cations, total alkalinity, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and chlorophyll ""a"" had increased values the during low discharge period, while concentrations of DOC, ammonium, nitrite, phosphate and SPM had increased values during the high discharge period. Chloride, sulfate, silica and pH showed no clear relationship with discharge. These patterns also were correlated with hydrological flow paths originating from different sources. Wavelet decomposition was used to characterize precipitation anomalies largely associated both with long-term climate factors (i.e. ENSO) and short-term climate responses from the two discharge periods that were studied. Distinct responses of fluvial hydrochemistry were observed including ENSO-induced fluctuation to be particularly strong for DOC, with annual flux varying approximately 60% around measured median value.

1004,"Application research of crosshole electromagnetic tomography The main technological objective of crosshole EM tomography is to realize direct electrical measurements between wells and acquire 2D or 3D resistivity images reflecting hydrocarbon and water distribution between wells. A co-operation and joint study between Shengli Oilfield of China and EMI Company of USA for the application method of crosshole EM system has being gone on since 1997. The cooperation comprises of the following aspects: to examine further the performance of the tools and explicit improvement direction, to analyse the adaptability and the feasibility to reservoir research through large-scale and systematic field tests in the condition of large well separation, to accelerate the development of processing and interpretation method and its software based on systematic field data to carry on systematic tests in steel-cased boreholes and explore the imaging method of resistivity in the condition of steel-casing. In November 1998, June and July 1999, large-scale industrial field tests with 10 measurements in 3 pairs wells were successfully conducted in the low resistivity profile in Shengli Oilfield. Firstly, the formation is of typical low resistivity profile with the background resistivity of 1.5-2. 0 Omegam. The attenuation of the EM energy in the formation is very serious. Secondly, the field tests were conducted systematically passing through one and two steel-casing. The desired goals were achieved in the three tests. Not only is the performance of the tools proved to be stable and reliable, but also complete crosshole EM data with good repeatability and accuracy were acquired for the first time in the world between the wells with the separation of 434m of open-hole to open-hole and 150m of open-hole to casing-hole. The resistivity images derived from the data inversion shows good geological results in the analysis of hydrocarbon distribution and reservoir recovery states between wells.",
1005,"An environmentally-friendly integrated seismic imaging for coal exploration in the Miocene Soma Basin, Western Turkey Seismic reflection data from target depths of several hundred metres have been acquired and processed as an aid for lignite exploration in the Miocene Soma Basin, western Turkey. An environmentally-friendly approach was followed by acquiring the data with mini-vibroseisseismic source along crooked lines, using available mountain/forest and village roads; quality control tests were conducted to determine optimal field parameters that would yield dataset with best signal-to-noise (SN) ratio prior to real data acquisition; and stratigraphic interfaces giving rise to reflection events in the seismic data were identified from the vertical seismic profiling (VSP). Stacked seismic sections were successfully correlated with geological cross-sections drawn based on available borehole data. Thus, it is shown that decreasing time and the cost for coal exploration is possible by utilising surface and VSP. Environment friendly approach of the seismic method applied in this study is also beneficial in regard to environmental concerns.",

1007,"Proposal of an irrigation water quality index (IWQI) for regional use in the Federal District, Brazil The present study aimed to propose a water quality index (WQI) for the Federal District, Brazil, as a management tool for water resources used in irrigation. Irrigated agriculture is a sector that has been growing in the region, with a consequent demand for quality water. One strategy for assessing water quality in rural areas is to adopt monitoring programs, which generate a large amount of data that often needs to be synthesized. The use of indexes is a way of organizing data in a synthetic and easy to understand format. Although initially formulated to assess the quality of drinking water, it is believed that a similar logic can easily be applied to assess the quality of irrigation water. Studies that evaluate the quality of water for irrigation are very common in arid or semi-arid regions, due to the problems of saline water in the soil and crops. On the other hand, the microbiological approach to water is poorly investigated, since contamination of crops can pose a risk to food security. In this work, three water bodies were selected in rural areas due to their preponderant use: irrigation. The monitoring occurred between May 2012 and April 2013 in 9 sampling points. For each sample collected, 22 physical, chemical, and biological parameters were established. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used in the evaluation and selection of water quality variables to compose the WQI. From PCA, it was possible to reduce the number of parameters from 16 to 6 main ones that reflect the water resources characteristics in the region, which were pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, sodium absorption ratio, nitrate, and Escherichia coli. Of the five classes proposed for WQI, two points were classified as ""very good."" The other sample points were classified as ""good"" and ""average"" for the irrigation practice. The adapted WQI proved to be a good tool in the management of the water quality of the three rivers, and it can be easily used to assess the quality of water for irrigation in the region.",
1008,"Spatial variation and quantitative screening level assessment of human risk from boron exposure in groundwater resources of western edge of the Lake Urmia, Iran Boron is a ubiquitous element and exposure to high concentrations of boron in drinking water may lead to health outcomes. This study aimed to analyze boron in rural drinking water resources located at the west of Urmia Lake. An innovative risk matrix was developed for faster assessment of risk status and adaptation of mitigation approaches. The mean boron concentration in 121 drinking water sources from 301 villages obtained 1477Â Â±Â 1683 Î¼g/L. In the west of Urmia lake and northwestern parts of the lake (east of Salmas city), boron concentrations were up to twice the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Using regional screening levels calculator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US.EPA), as a deterministic risk assessment model, the total risks/Non-carcinogenic hazard index (HI) risks from exposure to 13,000 and 2600 Î¼g/L of boron obtained 1.94E+00 and 3.91E-01, respectively. More investigations are recommended for better understanding of the extent of contamination in the study area.",
1009,"Removal of hazardous dyes, toxic metal ions and organic pollutants from wastewater by using porous hyper-cross-linked polymeric materials: A review of recent advances Water quality plays a central role in the well-being of all the living organisms on planet Earth. The ever-increasing human population and consequently increasing industrialization, urbanization, and chemically boosted cultivation are rapidly contaminating already stressed water resources. The availability of clean drinking water has become scarce for masses across the globe, and this situation is becoming alarming in developing countries. Therefore, the immediate need for cost-effective, easily accessible, eco-friendly, portable, thermally efficient, and chemically stable technologies and materials is desperately felt to meet the high global demand for clean water. To search for effective materials for wastewater treatment, the hyper-cross-linked porous polymers (HCPs) have emerged as an excellent class of porous materials for wastewater treatment due to their unique features of high surface area, tunability, biodegradability, and chemical versatility. This review describes the advances in fabrication strategies and the efficient utilization of hyper-cross-linked porous polymers for wastewater treatment. Moreover, this review specifically discusses the hyper-cross-linked porous polymers effectiveness for the separation of the dyes, nutrients, inorganic ions, organic contaminants, and toxic metals ions. Finally, the review provides insight into the challenges and prospects in the area of hyper-cross-linked porous polymers. Overall, the hyper-cross-linked porous polymers with empowering proper functionalization can provide an opportunity for the wastewater treatment not only to remove toxic contaminants but also to make contaminated water useful for various applications.",
1010,"Application of multivariate statistical analysis and hydrochemical and isotopic investigations for evaluation of groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking and agriculture purposes: case of Oum Ali-Thelepte aquifer, central Tunisia Groundwater plays a dominant role in arid regions; it is among the most available water resources in Tunisia. Located in northwestern Tunisia, Oum Ali-Thelepte is a deep Miocene sedimentary aquifer, where groundwater is the most important source of water supply. The aim of the study is to investigate the hydrochemical processes leading to mineralization and to assess water quality with respect to agriculture and drinking for a better management of groundwater resources. To achieve such objectives, water analysis was carried out on 16 groundwater samples collected during January-February 2014. Stable isotopes and 26 hydrochemical parameters were examined. The interpretation of these analytical data showed that the concentrations of major and trace elements were within the permissible level for human use. The distribution of mineral processes in this aquifer was identified using conventional classification techniques, suggesting that the water facies gradually changes from Ca-HCO3 to Mg-SO4 type and are controlled by water-rock interaction. These results were endorsed using multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The sustainability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation was assessed based on the water quality index (WQI) and onWilcox and Richards's diagrams. This aquifer has been classified as ""excellent water"" serving good irrigation in the area. As for the stable isotope, the measurements showed that groundwater samples lay between global meteoric water line (GMWL) and LMWL; hence, this arrangement signifies that the recharge of the Oum Ali-Thelepte aquifer is ensured by rainwater infiltration through mountains in the border of the aquifer without evaporation effects.",1
1011,"[Preliminary analysis of spatiotemporal variation of water quality and its influencing factors in the Jiulong River watershed] Twenty one sub-watersheds in the Jiulong River watershed were chosen for in-situ monitoring water quality of baseflow in flood season, dry season and average season in 2010. Geographical information system and multivariate analysis were coupled to characterize the spatiotemporal variation of water quality and identify its influencing factors. The results show that the water quality in dry season is the worst whereas the water quality in flood season is comparatively good. The first principal component representing sanitary and industrial wastewater pollution, explained 45.58% of the total variance of water quality. The second principal component concerning pollution due to agricultural activities, explained 21.28% of the total variance. NH4(+) -N, SRP, potassium permanganate index, K+, Cl-, Mg2+ and Na had a significantly positive correlation with percentage of built-up and density of population. NO3(-) -N was correlated positively with percentage of cropland. The sub-watersheds with high proportion of build-up area and density of population show high concentration of NH4(+) -N, SRP, potassium permanganate index, K+, Cl-. Comparatively, the sub-watersheds with high percentage of cropland show high level of nitrate concentration. Improvement of the wastewater treatment efficiency and increased recognition of agricultural non-point source pollution were finally highlighted from watershed management perspectives.",
1012,"Evaluation of the impact of water supply disruptions in bioethanol production Factors such as raw materials availability, production capacity, technology, and costs promote the development and feasibility of supply chains. However, some other factors are more than important for supply chain development; they are essential. In the context of biofuel supply chains, water is a crucial factor; nevertheless, scientific research has not yet analyzed how water scarcity can compromise the performance of these supply chains. To address this gap, this research analyzes as a case study a leading company in Mexico that produces and distributes biofuel in the country. Lately, the company has experienced serious production stoppages due to water supply disruptions. This work develops a system dynamics simulation model to evaluate, by means of a sensitivity analysis, the effects of water supply disruption on industrial production and biofuel demand satisfaction in four duration periods: 8, 12, 24, and 48 h. The results indicate that production disruptions due to water scarcity can be avoided by reducing the mash flow that feeds the distillation column as long as the water scarcity period lasts no more than 12 h. Similarly, it was found that demand satisfaction decreases when the scarcity period lasts for 24-48 h, yet demand satisfaction remains stable when water disruption lasts less than 24 h. The findings also indicate that when demand increases by 20%, it is impossible to fulfill it in any case. Therefore, several scenarios designed to improve demand satisfaction were evaluated.",
1013,"Distribution and production of reactive mercury and dissolved gaseous mercury in surface waters and water/air mercury flux in reservoirs on Wujiang River, Southwest China Transformation and distribution of mercury (Hg) species play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of mercury in aquatic systems. Measurements of water/air exchange fluxes of Hg, reactive mercury (RHg), and dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentrations were conducted at 14 sites in five reservoirs on the Wujiang River, Guizhou, Southwest China. Clear spatial and temporal variations in Hg fluxes, RHg, and DGM concentrations were observed in the study area. Hg fluxes and RHg concentrations exhibited a consistent diurnal variation in the study area, with maximum fluxes and concentrations during daytime. A typical diurnal trend of DGM with elevated concentration at night was observed in a eutrophic reservoir with elevated bacteria abundance, suggesting a bacteria-induced production of DGM in this reservoir. For other reservoirs, a combination of sunlight-stimulated production and loss via photo-induced oxidation and evaporation regulated the diurnal trends of DGM. Seasonal variations with elevated Hg fluxes and RHg concentrations in warm season were noticeable in the study area, which highlighted the combined effect of interrelationships between Hg species in water and environmental parameters. Hg fluxes exhibited much more significant correlations with RHg and THg concentrations and air temperature compared to DGM concentrations and solar radiation. The measured fluxes were significantly higher than those simulated using the water/air thin film Hg0 gradient model. Aside from the potential limitations of dynamic flux chamber method, this may also suggest the thin film gas exchange model is not capable of predicting water/air Hg flux under low wind speed conditions. Additionally, it is speculated that DGM concentrations might vary significantly in surface waters with depth, and measurements of DGM at a depth of 2-4cm below the water surface probably underestimated the DGM concentration that should be taken into account in simulations of water/air flux using the thin film gas exchange model. An empirical model of water/air Hg flux was developed, and the simulated fluxes were compared well with measurements. The model yields a mean annual Hg emission of 3.2 +/- 1.0kg in the study area.",1
1014,"Deformation and regional carbonate metasomatism of turbidite-hosted Cretaceous alkaline lamprophyres (northwestern Papua New Guinea) A suite of variably metasomatised camptonite dykes and rare stocks, named the Fu Intrusives, has been recognised within thrust plates of Mesozoic slates in a 3000-km2 portion of the New Guinea Thrust Belt. The intrusions were emplaced prior to Oligo-Miocene fold deformation and low-grade regional metamorphism of their host, and consequently have foliated margins and are cross-cut by metamorphic quartz veins. Samples from the less altered stocks display primary cumulophyric aggregates of kaersutite + titansalite + titanbiotite, set in a matrix of albite + salite + apatite Â± olivine Â± quartz. Calcite ocelli are occasionally present. REE patterns ( LaCN LuCN âˆ¼ 10, La âˆ¼ 100 Ã— chondrite) and initial Sr ratios (âˆ¼0.7042) are typical of alkaline lamprophyres. Kaersutite and titanbiotite separates from such samples have yielded concordant KAr ages of âˆ¼75 Ma (Campanian), which we accept as the age of intrusion. However, the dykes have suffered heavy texture-destructive carbonate-sericite alteration, though relict cumulophyric texture and globular structures are sometimes observed. Composition-volume calculations suggest that metasomatism was accompanied by loss of Na, Ti and P; and systematic addition of Ca, Fe and CO2, as well as progressive LREE depletion and Fe reduction. Alteration carbonates exhibit a narrow range of Î´18O-values (+ 13.8 to + 14.9â€°), indicating uniform conditions of metasomatism throughout the terrain. The calculated fluid Î´18O at a model temperature of 300 Â± 50Â°C is +8Â±2â€°, which corresponds with that deduced from the Î´18O-value (+ 12.3â€°) of the cleanest sericite separate. The four analysed sericite separates have a mean Î´D of -64 Â± 12â€°, implying an hydrogen isotopic composition for the alteration fluid of -58 Â± 30â€° at 300 Â± 50Â°C. The calculated fluid composition therefore overlaps the normal range of metamorphic and magmatic waters. However, C and Sr isotopic ratios of the alteration carbonates (Î´13C - 7.3 to + 0.4â€°; 87Sr86Sr 0.7076-0.7126) strongly support a crustal source for the metasomatic fluids. This is corroborated by field evidence that country rock slates adjacent to the dykes are unaffected by carbonate metasomatism and hence were in equilibrium with the alteration fluid. We therefore conclude that regional carbonate metasomatism of the Fu Intrusive Suite occurred as a result of metamorphic dewatering of their host rocks during slaty cleavage development. Â© 1988.",
1015,"Agriculture in Iraq: Resources, potentials, constraints, research needs and priorities The agrarian sector in Iraq witnessed a number of drastic measures during the last 40 years. Estimates of cultivable land areas vary from 5-8 million ha; however, no more than 3.5 million ha (47% irrigated and 53% dryland farming) have been actually cultivated. Renewable fresh water resources are estimated at about 2,000 m(3)/person/year; however, Iraq faces huge water problems; these are caused by geographic, topographic and management factors. Prior to 1990, Iraq produced about one-third of its annual basic food needs and spent about US$ 2 billion to import the balance of its requirements. Since then, despite emphasis on increasing food production, the country continues to face deterioration in the agricultural sector. Agricultural production remains constrained due to lack of quality seed, herbicides, insecticides, fertilizers, animal vaccines, machinery, irrigation equipment and spare parts. Moreover, water resources in the drylands are declining due to a severe drought which devastated crops on 70% of the rainfed arable land in the country. Farmers in Iraq are struggling to produce under poor environmental conditions with few tools for coping with drought, salinity, pests, and shortages of inputs and lack of appropriate technologies. Iraqi cereal production dropped sharply in the past decade due to problems with its seed multiplication system, leading to degradation of seed quality and productivity. Land degradation, salinization, and declining crop yields due to mismanagement of land resources and lack of inputs, are serious problem, especially in the irrigated lands. The country's rangelands and forest resources are deteriorating mainly as a result of overstocking what are essentially fragile ecosystems and because of deforestation for fuelwood and charcoal. The livestock sector experienced serious problems during the last decade because of shortages of feed, veterinary services and vaccines. Number of farm animals declined during the last decade, and in spite of the government's efforts to boost livestock production, meat and milk production declined by 24% during the late 1980s as compared to the 1970s. Iraq faces serious problems of environmental degradation that must be addressed immediately because failure to act now will greatly compound the cost and complexity of later remedial efforts, and because environmental degradation is beginning to pose a major threat to human well-being, especially among the poor. To deal with the multiple challenges imposed upon it by internal and external factors, the agricultural sector in Iraq has to structurally adjust itself to address socioeconomic, land-use, livestock production and feed resources, water resources, agro-ecology, environmental protection, and research and extension components in a holistic, multidisciplinary and long-term manner.",

1017,"Prevalence and Correlates of Cryptosporidium Infections in Kenyan Children With Diarrhea and Their Primary Caregivers Background. Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrhea in Sub-Saharan Africa and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in young children. Methods. We analyzed data from children aged 6-71 months presenting to 2 public hospitals in Western Kenya with acute diarrhea and their primary caregivers, including detection of Cryptosporidium by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunoassay analysis in stool samples from both children and their caregivers. Associations between potential transmission sources and child/caregiver Cryptosporidium infection were evaluated using prevalence ratios (PRs). Secondary analyses evaluated host and clinical risk factors of child/caregiver Cryptosporidiurn infection. Results. Among 243 child-caregiver pairs enrolled, 77 children (32%) and 57 caregivers (23%) had Cryptosporidium identified by either immunoassay or PCR. Twenty-six of the 243 child-caregiver pairs (11%) had concordant detection of Cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidium infection in children was associated with detection of Cryptosporidium in caregivers (adjusted PR [aPR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.6; P = .002) and unprotected water source (aPR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.2; P = .003). Risk factors for Cryptosporidiurn detection in caregivers included child Cryptosporidium infection (aPR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.0; P = .002) as well as cow (aPR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.0; P = .02) and other livestock ownership (aPR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.3; P = .03) vs no livestock ownership. Recent diarrhea in caregivers and children was independently associated with child and caregiver Cryptosporidium infections, respectively. Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Cryptosporidium transmission can occur directly between child-caregiver dyads as well as through other pathways involving water and livestock. Additional research into caregivers as a source of childhood Cryptosporidiurn infection is warranted.",
1018,"Riverbank Filtration: A Sustainable Process to Attenuate Contaminants during Drinking Water Production Riverbank filtration leads to purification of water. For India it can be a simple, economical and effective alternative. A few unanswered questions were: Can it work in Indian mountainous regions? Will it be of any advantage in the case of some of the polluted Indian surface waters? With the goal to evaluate use of riverbank filtration as a sustainable technology under widely varying conditions prevalent in India, the effectiveness of riverbank filtration has been examined over the last 10 years. In the case of cleaner surface waters, the wells deliver water free of turbidity and coliform even during monsoon irrespective of well configuration. In the case of polluted source waters, it results in an overall advantage in terms of improved raw water quality, reduced degree and cost of subsequent treatment and decreased levels of disinfection by-products. The study shows riverbank filtration to be an effective and sustainable option for plains as well as the mountainous region.",
1019,"Medium-term forecasts for groundwater production and rainfall amounts (Deir El-Balah City as a case study) Forecasting is a data mining technique which benefits from a variety of time series data sources to extract actual value from historical data and helps business decision-makers in effective planning. An increase in demand for groundwater associated with uncontrolled well digging and reduced rainfall, which is the primary source of groundwater recharge, has led to the depletion of groundwater wells. As a result, the mixing of seawater with groundwater increases the salinity rate, especially in areas where wells are close to the Mediterranean Sea in Gaza. Wells digging without governmental control, increasing salinity percentages. Therefore, the arching aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between rainfall and groundwater production. In this paper, five forecasting techniques were applied on two real data sets: the rain amounts we gained from the Ministry of Agriculture and the groundwater production amounts from the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) of Deir El-Balah City in the Gaza Strip. The following forecasting algorithms were used: exponential smoothing (ETS); auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); and ARIMA combined with neural network (NN), (ETS) and state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, and trend and seasonal components (TBATS). The best performance of applied algorithms on rainfall data according to mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) measure was (ARIMA + NN) which gave the MAPE = 21%. On the other hand, ARIMA was the most convenient algorithm to forecast wells production (MAPE = 4.9%). The results demonstrated that within the next 5 years, the amounts of rainfall and groundwater production will decrease by 8.4% and 1.05%, respectively, compared to the amounts of rainfall and groundwater produced over the time span over the period (2013-2017). Based on these results, it was concluded that salinity would continue to increase in the coming years making the groundwater unusable.",
1020,"INFLUENCE OF ENCAPSULATING MATERIALS ON WATER SORPTION ISOTHERMS OF VACUUM-DRIED PERSIMMON PULP POWDER Water sorption isotherms for vacuum-dried persimmon pulp (PP) powder were determined in the temperature range of 20-50C, and the effects of maltodextrin (MD) or gum arabic (GA) addition on the water sorption behavior of the dried powders were analyzed. Several models were evaluated to fit the experimental data and the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer model was selected as the most adequate to describe the observed behavior. Addition of encapsulants affected the isotherms: at the same water activity, PP powder with added GA (PP + GA) or MD (PP + MD) presented lower equilibrium water content than pure PP and were less affected by temperature variations. Samples of PP + MD presented lower equilibrium moisture content than those of PP + GA. The isosteric heats of sorption of pulp powders with encapsulants were higher (less negative) than those of PP, suggesting that there are more active polar sites in PP than in pulp powder containing encapsulants. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The choice of persimmon to carry out this work was due to the large persimmon production available in Brazil; moreover, persimmon pulp is rich in vitamin C, vitamin A and iron, as well as in phenolic compounds. Drying of fruit pulps with high sugar content presents technical difficulties because the hygroscopicity and thermoplasticity of the resulting powders when exposed to high temperature and relative humidity. For this reason, addition of high-molar-mass biopolymers, such as maltodextrin or gum arabic, is a strategy to aid drying and to improve storage stability. Knowledge of water sorption isotherms and net isosteric heats of sorption is important to various food processing operations, including drying, storage and packaging. They are useful in calculating time and energy consumptions during drying, modeling moisture changes during storage and predicting shelf life of food products.",
1021,"Arsenic removal from naturally arsenic contaminated ground water by packed-bed electrocoagulator using Al and Fe scrap anodes In this work, feasibility of electrocoagulation (EC) process with Al and Fe scrap anodes for treatment of groundwater contaminated with arsenic (As) was examined as a cheaper treatment alternative for affected remote communities. EC experiments were carried out in a batch packed-bed EC reactor and the effect of applied current (0.010-0.100 A), type of scrap electrode (Fe and Al), packed-bed density (0.1-0.4 kg/m(3) for Fe and 0.02-0.08 kg/m(3) for Al) and EC time were investigated. Optimum operating conditions to obtain maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mu g/L for total As (>93% removal) in ground-water samples were determined as 8 min and 0.05 A for Fe scrap anodes. Whereas for Al scrap anode, 30 min and 0.10 A were the optimums. The operating cost, energy and electrode consumptions at these optimums were calculated as 0.017 US $/m(3), 0.070 kW h/m(3) and 0.052 kg/m(3) for Fe anodes and 0.181 US $/m(3), 0.876 kW h/m(3) and 0.067 kg/m(3) for AL anodes respectively. The As removal slightly decreased with decrease in anode bed density. Moreover, Fe scrap anodes exhibited better As removal than the Al scrap anodes at all tested conditions. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the electro-coagulated sludge revealed irregular and porous particles with amorphous structure.

1022,"Fluid lives: subjectivities, gender and water in rural Bangladesh This article seeks to contribute to the emerging debates in gender-water and gender-nature literatures by looking at the ways that gendered subjectivities are simultaneously (re) produced by societal, spatial and natural/ecological factors, as well as materialities of the body and of heterogeneous waterscapes. Drawing from fieldwork conducted in Bangladesh on arsenic contamination of drinking water, the article looks at the ways that gender relations are influenced by not just direct resource use/control/access and the implications of different types of waters, but also by the ideological constructs of masculinity/femininity, which can work in iterative ways to influence how people relate to different kinds of water. Conflicts and struggles over water inflect gendered identities and sense of self, where both men and women participate in reproducing and challenging prevailing norms and practices. As a result, multiple social and ecological factors interact in complex and interlinked ways to complicate gender-water relations, whereby socio-spatial subjectivities are re/produced in water management and end up reinforcing existing inequities. The article demonstrates that gender-water relations are not just intersected by social axes, as generally argued by feminist scholars, but also by ecological change and spatial relations vis-a-vis water, where simultaneously socialized, ecologized, spatialized and embodied subjectivities are produced and negotiated in everyday practices.",
1023,"Shortening the recurrence periods of extreme water levels under future sea-level rise Sea-level rise, as a result of global warming, may lead to more natural disasters in coastal regions where there are substantial aggregations of population and property. Thus, this paper focuses on the impact of sea-level rise on the recurrence periods of extreme water levels fitted using the Pearson type III (P-III) model. Current extreme water levels are calculated using observational data, including astronomical high tides and storm surges, while future extreme water levels are determined by superposing scenario data of sea-level rise onto current extreme water levels. On the basis of a case study using data from Shandong Province, China, results indicated that sea-level rise would significantly shorten the recurrence periods of extreme water levels, especially under higher representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. Results showed that by the middle of the century, 100-year current extreme water levels for all stations would translate into once in 15-30 years under RCP 2.6, and once in ten to 25 years under RCP 8.5. Most seriously, the currently low probability event of a 1000-year recurrence would become common, occurring nearly every 10 years by 2100, based on projections under RCP 8.5. Therefore, according to this study, corresponding risk to coastlines could well be increase in future, as the recurrence periods of extreme water levels would be shortened with climate change.",
1024,"The application of rock mass classification systems to underground excavation in weak limestone, Ataturk dam, Turkey The Ataturk dam was built across the Firat River on clayey limestone. A grout curtain, providing impermeability in the left and right abutments, was done in grouting galleries. The well known rock mass classification systems for tunneling purposes [rock structure rating (RSR), rock mass rating (RMR) and rock mass quality index (Q)] were used to classify the rock mass along these galleries. Based on RSR, RMR and Q values, the rock masses in the galleries have been classified into three different classes. Correlation between the three classification systems is discussed and suggestions are made for using rockbolt, shotcrete with wiremesh and steel ribs for supporting the rock mass.

1025,"Effects of afforestation on soil CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes in a nsubtropical karst landscape Afforestation is of importance for terrestrial carbon sequestration as well as soil and water conservation in karst landscapes. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of afforestation on soil CH(4) and N(2)O emissions in subtropical karst areas. Thus, a year-round field experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of afforestation on soil CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes from a subtropical karst landscape in South China. In this study, soil CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes were simultaneously monitored using static chamber-gas chromatography from three paired sites, including a cropland site (SC) and adjacent sites at two stages of afforestation, a shrubland (SD) and a woodland (AF). The results showed that annual soil CH(4) uptake for SC, SD, and AF sites were 1.53Â Â±Â 0.20Â kgÂ CÂ ha(-1)Â yr(-1), 2.90Â Â±Â 0.20Â kgÂ CÂ ha(-1)Â yr(-1), and 5.68Â Â±Â 0.18Â kgÂ CÂ ha(-1)Â yr(-1), respectively. Afforestation (i.e., SD and AF sites) significantly increased soil CH(4) uptake compared with the adjacent cropland. Annual soil N(2)O fluxes for SC, SD, and AF sites were 2.38Â Â±Â 0.17Â kgÂ NÂ ha(-1)Â yr(-1), 0.94Â Â±Â 0.14Â kgÂ NÂ ha(-1)Â yr(-1), and 0.47Â Â±Â 0.01Â kgÂ NÂ ha(-1)Â yr(-1), respectively. Afforestation significantly decreased soil N(2)O fluxes compared with the adjacent cropland. The effects of afforestation on soil CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes in the present study were mainly attributed to changes in soil characteristics, such as temperature and moisture, as these were significantly correlated with soil CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes across different experimental sites. The present study highlights that afforestation is an effective land use management practice to mitigate non-CO(2) greenhouse gas emissions from subtropical karst landscapes in South China.",

1027,"Effects of soil matric potential on potato growth under drip irrigation in the North China Plain This research examines the affect of five soil matric potential (SMP) treatments [F1 (-15 kPa), F2 (-25 kPa), F3 (-35 kPa), F4 (-45 kPa), F5 (-55 kPa)] under drip irrigation conditions conducted in the North China Plain. The temporal and spatial SMP changes observed in the soil profile along with changes in potato root growth suggest that tensiometers placed immediately beneath the emitter (at 20 cm) can be effectively used in scheduling the drip irrigation regimen. Although rain affected soil water distribution during the growing season, the affects of SMP on potato growth were very clear. Crop evapotranspiration was highest for F2, decreasing thereafter to F1, F3, F4, and F5. Other potato growth properties such as crop height, leaf and stem water content, tuber bulk rate and grade, as well as WUE (water use efficiency) and I-WUE (irrigation water use efficiency) suggest that an SMP of -25 kPa was the most favorable setting for potato production, while -15 kPa was too high and -45 kPa lead to severe water stress.

1029,"A Gateway to Successful River Restorations: A Pre-Assessment Framework on the River Ecosystem in Northeast China Natural rivers have been disturbed for hundreds of years by human activities. Previous water conservancy projects in the form of dams, reservoirs, dykes, and irrigation infrastructure focused on the social and economic benefits and disregarded the adverse effects on the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the affected rivers. Since the 2000s, the comprehension of river remolding has transformed so decisions are more socially and ecologically beneficial. However, restoration actions are often implemented aimlessly, without a detailed plan or sufficient communication, leading to the failure of accomplishing objectives for a variety of ecologic, financial, and social reasons. Thus, a pre-assessment framework is proposed in this paper, to determine river restoration priorities, emphasizing both social and ecological aspects. The vague notion of river health is evaluated using the Variable Fuzzy Assessment Model (VFAM) and expressed by modified Nightingale Rose Diagrams (NRDs). The river social ecosystem was subsequently analysed using this framework in the Ashihe River near Harbin City, Northeast China. The application of VFAM demonstrated that the health status of the upper, middle, and lower sections of the river could be classified as sub-healthy, degraded, or sick in terms of ecosystem structures, and sub-healthy, degraded, or degraded in terms of social functions, respectively. The health status of the lower section was the poorest and should be restored first. Using NRDs, we found that water quality deterioration and irrigation works are the two key factors in river degradation, which must be improved throughout the entire watershed. Aesthetics and recreation should also be given priority to restore the lower section due to the demands of nearby residents. Several measures are also suggested for decision makers who need a more detailed design to implement. This framework potentially assists with communicating with stakeholders, avoids aimless restoration actions, and contributes to comparing with the measuring after restorations.",
1030,"Monitoring multi-layer canopy spring phenology of temperate deciduous and evergreen forests using low-cost spectral sensors Emerging near-surface remote sensing techniques have advanced our ability to monitor forest canopy phenology. Thus far, however, little effort has been made to monitor the phenologies of the various canopies of multilayer forests separately, despite their importance in regulating forest biogeochemical cycles. Here we report phenological changes in multi-layer canopies of deciduous broadleaf and evergreen needleleaf forests in the Republic of Korea during the spring of 2013. We installed light-emitting diode (LED) sensors at four different canopy heights at two sites to measure the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance and to estimate leaf area index (LAI) using the blue band gap fraction. LED-sensors identified leaf-out dates of over- and understory canopies at both sites; leaves unfolded 8-11 days earlier in the understory canopy than the overstory canopy. At the deciduous forest site, LED-NDVI failed to capture the leaf-out date in the overstory canopy, because all four LED-sensors started to see green-up from the understory canopy while the overstory canopy was leafless. LED-LAI identified different leaf-out dates for the over- and understory canopy, because the gap fraction was measured explicitly for each canopy layer. In the evergreen forest site, LED-NDVI signals between the top of the tower and beneath the overstory canopy were decoupled because of the dense evergreen overstory canopy. Both LED-NDVI and LED-LAI identified new needle expansion in the overstory canopy and understory canopy development. MODIS NDVI agreed well with LED-NDVI data (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.04) at the deciduous forest site, and we discovered that understory canopy development determined the onset of greenness based on MODIS NDVI data. LED-LAI data agreed well with independent estimates from the other instruments, indicating that LED-sensors could be used to monitor multi-layer canopy LAI. Continuous, in-situ observation of multi-layer canopy phenology will aid in the interpretation of satellite remote sensing phenology products and improve land surface models that adopt a multi-layer canopy model.

1031,"Biogas energy generated from livestock manure in China: Current situation and future trends This article investigates the current status of the livestock industry (cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry) in China and assesses the potential for biogas production from anaerobically digested livestock manure. According to calculation results based on the latest data of livestock released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2018, China produced 2 x 10(12) kg of manure pollution in 2017, with pig waste representing the largest single manure source. Biogas that can be converted from high organic containing manure is a kind of clean bioenergy with low carbon footprint. In 2017, the energy potential from manure-produced biogas was about 5.74 x 10(12)-6.73 x 10(12) MJ, which corresponds to 4-5% of China's total energy demand. Correlation analysis between biogas production and the livestock industry showed that crop production had significant effects on manure-generated biogas production. However, it is necessary to address the challenges when applying AD technology. Bioenergy potential from manure will be lost during material collection and transportation. Although large-scale livestock farming remains controversial, this type of farming can improve the energy recovery rate of livestock manure. How to gain benefits and maintain sustainable development is also a bottleneck for AD promotion. Reducing energy input in AD projects as well as enhancing the efficiency of methanogenesis of livestock manure are key factors for achieving a high net output of biogas projects. More inclusive strategies and a broader vision should be adopted to allow stakeholders to benefit from manure-generated biogas projects.",
1032,"Spatial analysis of total dissolved solids in Dezful Aquifer: Comparison between universal and fixed rank kriging The spatial structure and auto-correlation of total dissolved solids (TDS) in an aquifer located in southwestern part of Iran were investigated by both Moran's index and variography. Since the feature of interest was non-stationary so, conventional methods of spatial analysis were not applicable and Universal kriging (UK) as a common method for spatial prediction of features with a spatial trend along with a novel geostatistical method known as fixed rank kriging (FRK) were utilized in this respect. The results of Moran's index were consistent with that of spatial analysis by geostatistical methods indicating the dominance of spatial clusters within the extent of study area. The spatial analysis by FRK was more efficient than that of its UK counterpart however the performance of UK was reasonable enough, as well. A variable selection by random forest (RF) was applied on eleven other water quality parameters that were the main constituents of TDS to identify the main parameters influencing the observed variability of TDS. It was turned out that RF is a viable method for variable selection in the realm of environmental sciences.",
1033,"Impact of effluent from Bodija abattoir on the physicochemical parameters of Oshunkaye stream in Ibadan City, Nigeria The problem of getting quality drinking water is increasing as untreated effluents are discharged into surface water bodies. The impact of effluent from Bodija abattoir, the biggest abattoir in Ibadan, western Nigeria on the physico-chemical parameters of Oshunkaye stream was investigated. The qualities of effluent and stream water (before and after mixing with effluent) were studied using the basic water quality parameters. The ranges of the physico-chemical parameters studied were as follows: pH 6.92 8.18, temperature 31 - 34 degrees C, total solids 7726 - 47 630 mg/I, total suspended solids 1498 - 6803 mg/I, chemical oxygen demand 947 - 2566 mg/I, oil and grease 2500 - 12590 mg/I, nitrate 62 - 159 mg/I, phosphate 142 - 180 mg/I, chloride 1052 - 1727 mg/I, lead 0.08 - 0.2 mg/I, nickel 0.18 - 0.49 mg/I, copper not detected - 0.14 mg/I, zinc 0.67 - 6.08 mg/I and cadmium ( not detected). Using Prati's et al classification of surface water quality, Oshunkaye stream fell in the class of grossly polluted water after mixing with effluent from the abattoir. While before mixing, it fell in class of slightly polluted. Hence the abattoir effluent needs to be treated before discharge into the receiving stream to reduce health hazard.",1
1034,"Human Health Risk Assessment of Nitrate and Trace Metals Via Groundwater in Central Bangladesh Groundwater plays a pivotal role as the largest potable water sources in Bangladesh. As agriculture is widely practiced in Bangladesh, potential nitrate (NO3-) pollution may occur. Besides, excess amount of arsenic (As) has already been found in groundwater in many parts of Bangladesh including the present study area. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the NO3- status along with some trace metals and associated human health risk in the Central Bangladesh. A total of 99 groundwater samples were analyzed to assess human health risk due to high level of NO3- and other trace elements i.e. arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn). Concentration of NO3- was determined using column chromatography and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was used to measure As, Fe and Mn concentrations. It was found that the mean concentration of NO3- 253.17 (mg/L) in the groundwater samples exceeds the recommended guideline value by the WHO (50 mg/L). Moreover, this study area also characterized with elevated concentration of As (19.44 mu g/L), Fe (811.35 mu g/L), and Mn (455.18 mu g/L) in the groundwater. Non-carcinogenic human health risk was calculated by justifying HQ (Hazard Quotient) and HI (Hazard Index) and attributed potential conjunctive human health risks due to NO3-, As, Fe and Mn in the study area. Child (9.941) is more vulnerable than adult (7.810) considering non-carcinogenic human health risk. Moreover, high carcinogenic risk was found due to As contamination in the groundwater samples and children (1.94x10(-3)) are more susceptible to carcinogenic risk compared to adults (9.2x10(-4)).",1
1035,"Higher risk of hyperglycemia with greater susceptibility in females in chronic arsenic-exposed individuals in Bangladesh Arsenic (As) toxicity and diabetes mellitus (DM) are emerging public health concerns worldwide. Although exposure to high levels of As has been associated with DM, whether there is also an association between low and moderate As exposure and DM remains unclear. We explored the dose-dependent association between As exposure levels and hyperglycemia, with special consideration of the impact of demographic variables, in 641 subjects from rural Bangladesh. The total study participants were divided into three groups depending on their levels of exposure to As in drinking water (low, moderate and high exposure groups). Prevalence of hyperglycemia, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and DM was significantly associated with the subjects' drinking water arsenic levels. Almost all exposure metrics (As levels in the subjects' drinking water, hair and nails) showed dose-dependent associations with the risk of hyperglycemia, IGT and DM. Among the variables considered, sex, age, and BMI were found to be associated with higher risk of hyperglycemia, IGT and DM. In sex-stratified analyses, As exposure showed a clearer pattern of dose-dependent risk for hyperglycemia in females than males. Finally, drinking water containing low-to-moderate levels of As (50.01-150â€¯Î¼g/L) was found to confer a greater risk of hyperglycemia than safe drinking water (As â‰¤10â€¯Î¼g/L). Thus the results suggested that As exposure was dose-dependently associated with hyperglycemia, especially in females.",1

1037,"HYDRAZINE-DEPENDENCY OF LOW-ALLOY STEEL FLOW-ACCELERATED CORROSION IN A DEOXYGENATED SOLUTION AT 250 degrees C In the nuclear power plants (NPPs), wall thinning of the piping materials is generally caused by a flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC) and leads to a rupture with no warning unless it is detected and repaired in a timely manner. To reduce the FAC, it is better to use low-alloy steels, such as 1Cr-1/2Mo and 21/4Cr-1Mo, having higher FAC-resistance than carbon steel. Meanwhile, in the secondary water chemistry at the NPPs in Korea, hydrazine concentration is maintained within the range of 100 similar to 150 ppb. For applying these low-alloys to a piping material, we investigated the influence of hydrazine concentration on their FAC. An experiment was carried out at pH(25 degrees C) of 9 controlled with ammonia in a deoxygenated aqueous solution containing 0 similar to 250 ppb-hydrazine by using a FAC test loop at 250 degrees C for 300 hours. Experimental weight loss showed a hydrazine concentration dependency of the FAC in this concentration range, giving minimum at 150 ppb.",

Students from Arizona State University (ASU), University of New South Wales (UNSW) and Nepal's Tribbhuvan University (TU) have participated in three service learning courses in the small community of Amaltari, Nepal, to investigate the sustainable supply of biomass as well as analyzing the costs and benefits of biochar production in the community. Located in the south-central Nepal, Amaltari is one of the buffer zone communities across the Chitwan National Park and the research is focused on assessing the feasibility of using invasive plant species - Mikania micrantha and Lantana camara as the biochar feedstock. The distinguishing feature of our research is its focus on science-based and community-led innovation to co-generate solutions through integrating students and faculty from engineering and sustainability with the local biochar company and the buffer zone community of Amaltari. The case study will show that on-the-ground experiential and multiple stakeholder engagement processes involving disciplines ranging from sustainability to engineering to cultural anthropology have the potential to address 'wicked' environmental problems. We summarize the preliminary outcomes for the community and discuss the effective design and implementation of international service learning projects.",

(Richters, 1904a) and on Colombian specimens formerly attributed to Macrobiotus cf. crenulatus and here described, after re-examination, as Crenubiotus revelator sp. nov. The new genus is characterised by an additional ventral thickening on the anterior portion of the ventral lamina, dorsal apophysis absent or very reduced, modified stylet furcae, claws equal in structure to those of Richtersius Pilato & Binda, 1989, and very probably also Adorybiotus Maucci & Ramazzotti, 1981 and Diaforobiotus Guidetti, Rebecchi, Bertolani, Jonsson, Kristensen & Cesari, 2016; and, in the known species, cuticular pores, two macroplacoids, large well dentate lunules and a characteristic egg. The new species Crenubiotus revelator sp. nov. differs from Crenubiotus crenulatus comb. nov. in having smaller cuticular pores, a medio-ventral tooth in the buccal armature, more slender buccal tube, slightly more caudal stylet supports, slightly more slender claws, and in details of the egg.

Elevated concentrations of As in groundwater were still observed, exceeding the WHO guideline value in most of the tube wells investigated. Significant positive correlations between As concentrations in groundwater and human samples (hair and urine) were observed. Arsenic concentrations in human and hair appeared to be related to the groundwater usage habit, with higher levels found in drinking group than those in the washing group. Significant good correlations were also encountered between cumulative intakes of As, Mn, and Ba through groundwater consumption and hair concentrations. All these results indicate the chronic exposure to As and some other elements such as Mn and Ba. The total intakes of As, Mn, and Ba through rice and groundwater consumption were estimated to be ranged from 80-836, 49.3-1850, and 311-97100â€‰Âµg/day, respectively.

1041,"Review: Efficiently performing periodic elements with modern adsorption technologies for arsenic removal Arsenic (As) toxicity is a global phenomenon, and it is continuously threatening human life. Arsenic remains in the Earth's crust in the forms of rocks and minerals, which can be released into water. In addition, anthropogenic activity also contributes to increase of As concentration in water. Arsenic-contaminated water is used as a raw water for drinking water treatment plants in many parts of the world especially Bangladesh and India. Based on extensive literature study, adsorption is the superior method of arsenic removal from water and Fe is the most researched periodic element in different adsorbent. Oxides and hydroxides of Fe-based adsorbents have been reported to have excellent adsorptive capacity to reduce As concentration to below recommended level. In addition, Fe-based adsorbents were found less expensive and not to have any toxicity after treatment. Most of the available commercial adsorbents were also found to be Fe based. Nanoparticles of Fe-, Ti-, Cu-, and Zr-based adsorbents have been found superior As removal capacity. Mixed element-based adsorbents (Fe-Mn, Fe-Ti, Fe-Cu, Fe-Zr, Fe-Cu-Y, Fe-Mg, etc.) removed As efficiently from water. Oxidation of AsO(3)(3-)to AsO(4)(3-)and adsorption of oxidized As on the mixed element-based adsorbent occurred by different adsorbents. Metal organic frameworks have also been confirmed as good performance adsorbents for As but had a limited application due to nano-crystallinity. However, using porous materials having extended surface area as carrier for nano-sized adsorbents could alleviate the separation problem of the used adsorbent after treatment and displayed outstanding removal performances.",
1042,"Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change: What scope for payments for environmental services? In recent years, there has been a growing interest in payments for environmental services (PES) for ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA). So far, however, experiences and theoretical analyses of PES specifically for adaptation have not been well documented. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the opportunities and constraints of PES as an instrument for EBA. Specifically, we examine the potential for PES to address key elements for adaptation by focusing on three pathways: the user side, the provider side and institutional and societal change. In addition, we assess whether PES fulfils key requirements for adaptation policy instruments, notably effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy. We find that PES are not a panacea for all environmental services and country contexts, but can be promising adaptation policy instruments where certain preconditions are met and synergies prevail. We conclude on four points especially relevant for the practical scope for PES-adaptation synergies: (i) natural adaptation co-benefits (where the targeted environmental service serves a dual function, e. g. secured water quality and increased adaptive capacity), (ii) piggy-backing (where adaptation benefits are coincidental outcomes), (iii) adaptation-relevant institutional and sectoral spillovers from PES schemes, and (iv) direct payments for adaptation benefits.",
1043,"PHYSICOCHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT OF PEDOGENIC CARBONATE FORMATION IN DEVONIAN VERTIC PALEOSOLS, CENTRAL APPALACHIANS, USA The morphology and geochemistry of pedogenic carbonate found in vertic claystone palaeosols in the Devonian Catskill Formation in central Pennsylvania preserve a record of the physical and chemical environment of carbonate precipitation. The carbonate is characterized by three distinct petrographic generations. Pedogenic rhizoliths and nodules are the earliest precipitated generation, and typically consist of dull red-brown luminescent micrite. Clear, equant calcite spar cement fills voids in the centres of rhizoliths, as well as circumgranular cracks and septarian voids in nodules. Early spar cements are nonluminescent to dull luminescent, whereas later spar cements exhibit bright yellow-orange luminescence. Late stage pedogenic fractures are always occluded with very bright yellow-orange luminescent spar cements. The incorporation of progressively higher concentrations of Mn (up to 34 000 ppm) into successively younger calcite spar cements, without concomitant increases in Fe, suggests carbonate precipitation from an evolving meteoric water in which Mn2+ became increasingly mobile over time. The increased mobility is possibly due to decreasing Eh, resulting from oxidation of organic matter after rapid soil burial on the floodplain. The amount of Fe2+ available for incorporation into calcite was limited because most iron was immobile, having been earlier oxidized and bound to the palaeosol clay matrix as a poorly crystallized ferric oxide or oxyhydroxide mineral. Carbon isotope compositions of pedogenic carbonate correlate with the inferred depth of carbonate precipitation. Rhizoliths preserved below the lowest stratigraphic occurrences of pedogenic slickensides are consistently depleted in C-13 relative to nodules, which formed stratigraphically higher, within the zone of active soil shrink and swell processes. Nodular carbonate, precipitated in proximity to deep cracks in the soil, is enriched due to increased gas exchange with isotopically heavy atmospheric CO2. Accordingly, rhizolith compositions will most accurately estimate palaeoatmospheric levels of CO2; the use of nodule compositions may result in overestimation of P(CO2) by as much as 30%.",
1044,"Mineral magnetic properties of Chinese paddy soils and its pedogenic implications Magnetic susceptibility (MS) of paddy soils (Hydragric Anthrosols) and their corresponding dryland soils formed on the same parent materials in Zhejiang Province of Eastern China were measured in order to understand better magnetic profile discrimination and pedogenic magnetic minerals in paddy soils. Magnetic measurements showed that the MS values of paddy soils were much lower than those of dryland soils formed on the same parent materials. The higher the MS value of the original dryland soil is, the more remarkable the decrease in the MS value is when the soil is put under rice cultivation. Gleyed paddy soils exhibited very low MS value (<20 x 10(-8) m(3)kg(-1)) and frequency-dependent susceptibility (<3%), as well as greater enhancement of MS on heating. Waterlogging incubation experiment indicated that the MS loss of soil mainly occurred in day 15 to day 75 after water saturation. During the reduction period of 180 days, the overall MS losses of soils developed on Quaternary red clay and alluvial deposit were 78% and 80% respectively. The MS values of various particle size fractions in paddy soils were also much lower than those of dryland soils formed on the same parent materials. The largest loss in MS value occurred in the clay fraction cif paddy soil, which suggested that magnetic grains in clay fraction were readily dissolved. Thermomagnetic (kappa-T) analysis indicated that paddy soils had very different and complex behavior of MS with increasing temperature, which can be explained by the predominance of ferric oxide in a poorly crystalline phase. Thermal behavior of magnetic susceptibility suggested that ferrihydrite was present in all profiles of paddy soils. The illuvial horizon of paddy soils was enriched with crystalline nano-scale iron oxide phase (mainly goethite. hematite, and maghemite/magnetite). The oxidation and reduction cycle in paddy soils could lead to the formation of nanocrystalline iron oxide, which provided a new pathway to explain the formation of pedogenic magnetic minerals. Paddy soils showed an obvious magnetic profile differentiation due to the difference in soil pedo-hydrological regimes. Three distribution patterns of MS profiles could be identified in paddy soils. The differentiation of MS in paddy soils can be used to describe soil profile characterization, identify diagnostic horizon, and interpret soil hydrological regimes. These findings provided new tool for profile description, type identification, hydrological regime diagnosis of paddy soils. Our results also help understand magnetic dynamic of soils caused by waterlogging process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1045,"Arsenic and the epigenome: interindividual differences in arsenic metabolism related to distinct patterns of DNA methylation Biotransformation of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is one of the factors that determines the character and magnitude of the diverse detrimental health effects associated with chronic iAs exposure, but it is unknown how iAs biotransformation may impact the epigenome. Here, we integrated analyses of genome-wide, gene-specific promoter DNA methylation levels of peripheral blood leukocytes with urinary arsenical concentrations of subjects from a region of Mexico with high levels of iAs in drinking water. These analyses revealed dramatic differences in DNA methylation profiles associated with concentrations of specific urinary metabolites of arsenic (As). The majority of individuals in this study had positive indicators of As-related disease, namely pre-diabetes mellitus or diabetes mellitus (DM). Methylation patterns of genes with known associations with DM were associated with urinary concentrations of specific iAs metabolites. Future studies will determine whether these DNA methylation profiles provide mechanistic insight into the development of iAs-associated disease, predict disease risk, and/or serve as biomarkers of iAs exposure in humans.",
1046,"Genesis of the Ordovician Ma5(5) sub-member dolomites in the Ordos Basin, China To elaborate genesis of the Ordovician Ma5(5) Sub-member dolomites in the Ordos Basin, this study implemented a series of analyses, including petrological investigation and geochemical (constant and trace elements, and isotopes) characterization. Three main types of dolomites were identified, namely micritic dolomite, micritic silty dolomite and silty dolomite. Specifically, the micritic dolomite is featured by dull red luminescence, low degree of order, high Sr isotope value, positive linear MgO-CaO correlation, high contents of Na and Sr elements, low contents of Fe and Mn elements, obvious negative delta C-13 excursion and slightly positive delta O-18 value, all of which indicate a syngenetic-penesyngenetic closed, high salinity environment. In comparison, the micritic silty dolomite is characterized by no or extremely dull red luminescence, moderate-to-high degree of order, higher delta C-13 value, slightly lower Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio, and sharp decrease in contents of K, Al, Fe and Mn elements, all of which indicate this type of dolomite to be the product of seepage-reflux dolomitization. Moreover, difference in geochemical characteristics between micritic silty dolomites in the depression and those in the platform flat suggests the Mg-rich brine from the tidal flat to be the dolomitization fluid for the platform flat while the Mg-rich brine from the overlying Ma5(4) Sub-member to be the dolomitization fluid for the depression. Meanwhile, the silty dolomite is observed to have no or extremely dull red luminescence, high degree of order, heavy delta O-18 value, high Sr isotope, lower Na content, and higher Fe and Mn contents, which are attributed to burial dolomitization in the fresh water environment. The distribution of dolomite was demonstrated to be controlled by sedimentary microfacies, and the dolomite in the West Jingbian dolomitic flat area turns out to have the largest distribution area and thickness as well as the best reservoir capacity. Massive fractures and vugs were formed in the dolomitization process, which were the basis of high-quality reservoir formation, involving generation of a relatively small amount of intercrystalline micropores during the syngenetic-penesyngenetic dolomitization, intercrystalline pores after the penecontemporaneous dolomitization, and intercrystalline and dissolution pores during the burial dolomitization. Moreover, dissolution during hypergene and burial periods contributed to most of the reservoir space, while filling effect during the burial period significantly reduced porosity.",
1047,"Fluid evolution of Au-Cu zones in Urn Balad area, North Eastern Desert of Egypt: Implications from mineral chemistry and fluid inclusions Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Electron microprobe (EMPA) and fluid inclusion studies of the ore body, as well as geochemical analyses of country rocks were performed to determine the nature and characteristics of the mineralizing fluid responsible for Au-Cu deposits in Um Balad area, Northern Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Urn Balad Au-Cu deposits are confined to well developed-quartz veins and veinlets cutting through the hosting country rocks. Petrographic and geochemical investigations of the hosting rocks distinguished between two main rock units; 1) metagabbro-diorite rocks with tholeiitic nature derived in island arc/continental margin tectonic regime, and 2) granodiorite rocks formed from calc-alkaline magma in continental margin regime. Wallrock alterations are represented by propylitic and argillic types. The mineralized quartz veins are striking in NE-SW direction and dipping between (35 degrees-45 degrees) in SE direction, other mineralized mafic dykes enriched with auriferous quartz veinlets are trending NE-SW and dipping 70 degrees/SE. The main ore minerals are represented by gold, chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, malachite, covellite and goethite. While, geffroyite, cuprite, chrysocolla, pseudomalachite, britholite, wolframite, scheelite, hematite and rutile are detected as minor constituents. Fluid inclusions microthermometry and isochore calculations combined with chlorite geothermometry revealed that the Urn Balad deposits were formed at temperature ranging from 305 degrees C to 325 degrees C and pressure between (100-500 bar). The mineralization had been developed in the shallow levels, beneath the water table at depth of 350-1760 m, rather than common mesothermal vein-type deposits in Egypt. Magmatic water have been suggested as the main source for the mineralized fluid. The transportation of the gold metal seems to be happen as bisulfide complexes in moderately acidic environment. The deposition was resulted from combination of changes in physico-chemical parameters, temperature and pressure plus the instability of the reduced sulfur complexes. A contamination with metamorphic and/or meteoric water was also proposed that has strong influence during the depositional process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1048,"Optimization and modelling of a high temperature solar thermal storage adapted for hotplate operation To improve health and general welfare, better cooking and heating facilities are important for large areas in developing countries. For regions with a high frequency of direct sun, small concentrating solar systems can offer a good solution without deforestation and pollution. We assume an efficient, concentrating collector supplying heated air at some 350 Â°C to a rock storage. Systems with recirculation during charging may have very high thermal efficiency with one-stage storage. Once through air current systems require a second heat exchanger system serving e.g. to produce steam, hot water and pasteurized water, thus broadening the utilised temperature range as well as increasing the overall efficiency. However, these applications are outside the scope of this study and therefore warrant no further discussion here. The high temperature section powers a hotplate incorporated at the top of the storage. To extract heat, air circulation is conventionally used, but requires electric power. The hotplate is in this case studded with copper pins (on the underside) extending into a channel through which the hot air-current from the storage passes. To avoid the electric power requirement, an alternative is to use vertical aluminium plates, also attached (ensuring good metallic contact) on the underside of the hotplate, but then extend to reach the bottom of the storage. Optimization of both systems is discussed in some detail. A prototype of the conductor system, which has the prime advantage of not needing fan power for use in periods with no direct sun, is being tested.

1049,"Industrial water resources management based on violation risk analysis of the total allowable target on wastewater discharge To improve the capabilities of conventional methodologies in facilitating industrial water allocation under uncertain conditions, an integrated approach was developed through the combination of operational research, uncertainty analysis, and violation risk analysis methods. The developed approach can (a) address complexities of industrial water resources management (IWRM) systems, (b) facilitate reflections of multiple uncertainties and risks of the system and incorporate them into a general optimization framework, and (c) manage robust actions for industrial productions in consideration of water supply capacity and wastewater discharging control. The developed method was then demonstrated in a water-stressed city (i.e., the City of Dalian), northeastern China. Three scenarios were proposed according to the city's industrial plans. The results indicated that in the planning year of 2020 (a) the production of civilian-used steel ships and machine-made paper & paperboard would reduce significantly, (b) violation risk of chemical oxygen demand (COD) discharge under scenario 1 would be the most prominent, compared with those under scenarios 2 and 3",
1050,"The behaviour of trace and rare earth elements (REE) during hydrothermal alteration in the Rangan area (Central Iran) The rhyolitic dome in the Rangan area has been Subjected to hydrothermal alterations by two different systems, (1) A fossil magmatic-hydrothermal system with a powerful thermal engine of a deep monzodioritic magma.(2)An active hydrothermal system dominated by meteoric water. Based on mineralogical and geochemical Studies, three different alteration facies have been identified (phyllic, advanced argillic and silicic) with notable differences in REE and other trace elements behaviour. In the phyllic alteration zone with assemblage minerals Such as sericite, pyrite, quartz, kaolinite, LREE are relatively depleted whereas HREE are enriched. The advanced argillic zone is identified by the presence Of alunite-jarosite and pyrophyllite as well as immobility of LREE and depletion in HREE. In the silicic zone, most of LREE are depleted but HREE patterns are unchanged compared to their fresh rock equivalents. All the REE fractionation ratios (La/Yb)(cn), (La/Sm)(cn), (Tb/Yb)(cn), (Ce/Ce+)(cn) and (Eu/Eu+)(cn) are low in the phyllic altered facies. (Eu/Eu+)(cn) in both advanced and silicic facies is low too. In all alteration zones, high field strength elements (HFSE) (e.g. Ti, Zr. Nb) are depleted whereas transition elements (e.g. V, Cr, Co, Ni, Fe) are enriched. Geochemically speaking, trace and rare earth elements behave highly selective in different facies.

1051,"The impact of solar convective drying on kinetics, bioactive compounds and microstructure of stevia leaves Stevia is a natural non-caloric substitute to conventional sugar. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of solar convective drying on kinetics and quality attributes of stevia leaves grown in Morocco. The evaluated drying temperatures were 50, 60, 70 and 80 degrees C with an air flow of 300 and 150 m(3)/h. Effective moisture diffusivity was in the range of 5.07 x 10(-11) and 3.14 x 10(-10) m(2) s-(1). An activation energy was found to be 37.81 kJ/mol. Additionally, effective moisture diffusivity increases with the increase in drying air temperature and air flow. The experimental results demonstrated the technical feasibility for the solar drying of stevia. However, drying process, affected quality characteristics of stevia leaves. From the results obtained it was verified that drying conditions, particularly temperature and air flow, lead to stevia modifications that can cause quality degradation. Chlorophyll contents as well as the total phenolic and flavonoids content decreased as both air-drying temperature and air flow increased. Additionally, at high temperature (i.e. 80 degrees C) and air flow, microstructural deformation happens when it is mainly driven by the high diffusion and evaporation rates of water.

1052,"Mineral potential targeting and resource assessment based on 3D geological modeling in Luanchuan region, China In this paper, we used 3D modeling and nonlinear methods (fractal, multifractal, and probabilistic neural networks (PNN)) for regional mineral potential mapping and quantitative assessment for porphyry and skarn-type Mo deposits and hydrothermal vein-type Pb-Zn-Ag deposits in the Luanchuan region, China. A 3D geological model was constructed from various geological maps, cross sections, boreholes, and gravity and magnetic data. Geological features associated with mineralization were extracted using the 3D geological model and metallogenic models of porphyry and skarn-type Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag deposits. The multifractal method, principal component analysis, and power spectrum-area method were used to separate regional variability from local variability in the geochemical data. A 2.5D forward modeling of gravity and magnetic data was carried out to define the geometry, depth, and physical properties of geological bodies at depth. 3D visualization of the results assisted in understanding the spatial relations between the deposits and the other geological bodies (e.g., igneous intrusions). The PNN method was applied to represent and integrate multiple anomalies for mineral potential modeling. The concentration-area fractal method was used to classify the PNN mineral potential model. Three levels (ground surface and two subsurface horizontal planes) of mineral potential models were evaluated for undiscovered Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag deposits. Validation of the results shows that 3D modeling was useful for not only accurately extracting geological features but also for predicting potential mineral targets and evaluating mineral resources. The mineral potential targets identified consist of eight Mo potential targets and 15 Pb-Zn-Ag potential targets. Based on grade-tonnage data from the known Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag deposits and the results of 3D modeling, estimated potential resources of each of these types of deposits are 10.8 and 153.1 Mt (Pb+Zn is 152.9 Mt and Ag is 0.92 Mt), respectively.

1053,"Has the vision of a gender quota rule been realized for community-based water management committees in Kenya? Persisting gender inequities across political, economic, and public life have motivated global agendas to increase women's leadership at all levels of society. Gender quotas offer one solution to encourage equitable gender representation in public decision-making by specifying a target number of women to serve on publicly-elected bodies. For natural resource governance sectors, can gender quotas promote women's representation and participation in leadership? In 2010, Kenya enacted a new Constitution that included an article mandating that no one gender should make up greater than two-thirds of the composition of public committees. This 'two-thirds gender rule' also applies to community-level governance of water resources through water user resource associations, which were formally recognized in 2002. We present a study of community-based water committee compliance with Kenya's national two-thirds gender rule based on surveys, focus groups, and interviews with water committee members. We show that Kenya's gender quota has been moderately successful in increasing women's representation on water committees. However, men hold more higher-level leadership positions than women, who typically serve as trea surers. Although there were no statistically significant differences between men and women's selfreported participation frequency in various committee activities, men contributed significantly more hours per week to committee activities, facilitated meetings more frequently, and were more willing to lead meetings. Based on this leadership gap, we examine the sufficiency of a gender quota to promote equal leadership opportunities for women. We find that realizing the vision of a gender quota is conditional on how individuals are represented on community-based environmental committees as well as how individuals participate in committee activities.

1054,"Evaluation of dietary arsenic exposure and its biomarkers: a case study of West Bengal, India Few reports are available that characterize daily arsenic exposure through water and diet among people living in groundwater-contaminated regions and correlate it with biomarkers. The present study describes the total individual arsenic exposure and arsenic level in urine and hair of such an arsenic-exposed population in West Bengal. Demographic characteristics and the total daily arsenic intake through water and diet were determined in 167 (Group-1 participants selected from arsenic endemic region) and 69 (Group-2 participants selected from arsenic non-endemic region) in West Bengal. Out of 167 Group-1 participants 78 (Group-1A) had arsenical skin lesions while 89 Group-1B) had no such lesion. Arsenic level in water samples as well as diet, urine and hair samples, collected from all the individual participants, were estimated. The mean value of estimated total arsenic content from water and diet was 349 (range: 20-1615) Î¼g/day in 167 (Group-1) participants living in As endemic region [As in water: mean value 54 (range:BDL-326) Î¼g/L] and 36 (range:12-120) Î¼g/day in 69 (Group-2) participants living in As non-endemic region (As in water: below detection level (BDL), < 0.3 Î¼g/L). Estimated mean arsenic level in urine in these two groups of participants was 116 (range: 6-526) Î¼g/L and 17 (range: BDL-37) Î¼g/L and in hair was 1.0 (range: 0.22-3.98) mg/Kg and 0.16 (range: 0.06-0.37) mg/Kg, respectively. Multiple regressions analysis in Group-1 participants showed that total arsenic intake was associated significantly with urinary and hair arsenic level. The estimated regression coefficient was 0.0022 (95% confidence interval, C.I: 0.0016, 0.0028; P < 0.001) and 0.0024 (95% C.I: 0.0021, 0.003; P < 0.001), respectively. In sub group analysis, higher median urinary arsenic value relative to arsenic intake through water and diet was observed in 78 Group-1A subjects with skin lesion compared to urinary arsenic value in 89 Group-1B subjects without skin lesions, though there was a marginal difference of median total arsenic intake in these two groups. This study showed that significant elevation of arsenic level in urine and hair was associated with elevated arsenic intake through water and diet in people living in arsenic endemic region (Group-1), while these values were low in people living in non-endemic region (Group-2). Those with skin lesions were found to have higher arsenic in urine and hair compared to those without skin lesion with similar arsenic intake through water and diet.",1
1055,"Water quantity and quality dynamics of the THC--Tuyamuyun Hydroengineering Complex--and implications for reservoir operation BACKGROUND: In the Aral Sea basin, safe water resources are scarce and steadily becoming scarcer. Particularly high quality water is going to become a rare good. The object of the study was the Tuyamuyun Hydroengineering Complex (THC), a complex of artificial water reservoirs located in the lower Amu Darya River, which provides water for irrigation, industry, and drinking for the lower Amu Darya region. The focus was on operation of one of its four reservoirs, the Kaparas, which is mainly used for drinking water supply. The objective includes the investigation of impacts of conventional operation schemes on the reservoir water quality for improving drinking water quality (salinity). Basic operation rules for Kaparas, which can be considered as representative for conventional dam operation under dry year conditions, had to be identified and improved operation schemes derived. METHODS: Existing data archives were analysed, and further data were acquired from field surveys, data processing and modelling studies. Historical data were identified, which are appropriate to determine representative schemes for the conventional operation. For the simulation of time-dependent and depth-dependent changes of reservoir salinisation, the reservoir water quality model Lac was used and linked with the THC model. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Modelling results for the simulation of temperature dynamics and density stratification showed a sufficient congruence with the measured temperature profiles. The conformity of measured and calculated salt concentration is basically ensured. The reservoir, which fill with higher saline water at the end of the summer, aggravates the entrainment of high saline water in the entire water column. CONCLUSIONS: The current conventional operation regime mainly leads to filling the Kaparas reservoir with high saline water during the winter months. Even in the event of starting with comparable low salinity levels, the simulation demonstrates the rapid deterioration of the reservoir water quality. Under dry year conditions, the WHO standards for drinking water will be exceeded by 30% after two years, so that the impact of dry years in the context of water stress becomes visible. RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTLOOK: Processed data and results are now available to identify enhanced reservoir operation strategies for salinity reduction by changing the period of reservoir filling and release, as well as to initiate a detailed analysis of how water deficits in dry years may be reduced by improved operation regimes. Using adapted and enhanced operation rules for THC reservoirs, the local population within the lower Aral Sea basin might be supplied with more potable water of higher quality in future.",
1056,"Characteristics of nitrogen loading and its influencing factors in several typical agricultural watersheds of subtropical China Increasingly, the characteristics of nitrogen (N) loading have been recognized to be critical for the maintenance and restoration of water quality in agricultural watersheds, in response to the spread of water eutrophication. This paper estimates N loading and investigates its influencing factors in ten small watersheds variously dominated by forest and agricultural land use types in the subtropics of China, over an observation period of 23-29 months. The results indicate that the average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), NH4 (+)-N, and NO3 (-)-N were 0.83, 0.07, and 0.46 mg N L(-1) in the forest watersheds and 1.49-5.16, 0.21-3.23, and 0.99-1.30 mg N L(-1) in the agricultural watersheds, respectively. Such concentrations exceed the national criteria for nutrient pollution in surface waters considerably, suggesting severe stream pollution in the studied agricultural watersheds. The average annual TN loadings (ANL) were estimated to be 1,640.8 kg N km(-2) year(-1) in the agricultural watersheds, 63.3-86.1 % of which was composed of dissolved inorganic N (DIN; comprising NO3 (-)-N and NH4 (+)-N). The watershed with intensive livestock production (i.e., the maximum livestock density of 2.66 animal units (AU)â€‰ha(-1)) exhibited the highest ANL (2,928.7 kg N km(-2) year(-1)) related to N loss with effluent discharge. The results of correlation and principle component analysis suggest that livestock production was the dominant influencing factor for the TN and NH4 (+)-N loadings and that the percentages of cropland in watersheds can significantly increase the NO3 (-)-N loading in agricultural watersheds. Therefore, to restore and maintain water quality, animal production regulations and more careful planning of land use are necessary in the agricultural watersheds of subtropical China.",
1057,"Assessing the impact of shallow subsurface pipe drainage on soil salinity and crop yield in arid zone Purpose. Soil salinization is one of the key problems of sustainable development of arid agricultural land. Exploring the use of shallow subsurface pipe drainage to improve soil salinization. Methods. This study investigates the desalinization effect of shallow subsurface pipe drainage, in combination with drip irrigation under plastic mulch, in an arid region in China. Field data collection was conducted in 2010. Soil salinity at a range of soil depths, water EC and pH of subsurface pipe drainage and crop yield during crop growth stages in salinized farmlands were measured. Results and Conclusion. The results show that soil salinity was reduced significantly on mildly (1-3 dS m-1) and moderately (3-6 dS m-1) salinized farmlands. The highest desalinization rate of mildly and moderately salinized soils was 51% and 91% respectively. The desalinization in upper soil layers, to a depth of 60 cm, was more significant than that in lower soil layers. Drainage water salinity was much higher than irrigation water salinity. Crop yield on mildly and moderately salinized land increased about 25% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that the combination of drip irrigation and shallow subsurface pipe drainage on farmlands is potential feasible to desalt farmlands and to improve crop yield. The study has led to a desalinization of 330 ha year-1 in Xinjiang.",

1059,"Sugarcane/peanut intercropping system improves physicochemical properties by changing N and P cycling and organic matter turnover in root zone soil Background. The sugarcane/peanut intercropping system is a specific and efficient cropping pattern in South China. Intercropping systems change the bacterial diversity of soils and decrease disease rates. It can not only utilized light, heat, water and land resources efficiently, but also increased yield and economic benefits of farmers. Methods. We determined soil nutrients, enzymes and microbes in sugarcane/peanut intercropping system, and analyzed relevance of the soil physicochemical properties and the genes involved in N and P cycling and organic matter turnover by metagenome sequencing. Results. The results showed that sugarcane/peanut intercropping significantly boosted the content of total nitrogen, available phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter, pH value and bacteria and enhanced the activity of acid phosphatase compared to monocropping. Especially the content of available nitrogen, available phosphorus and organic matter increased significantly by 20.1%, 65.3% and 56.0% in root zone soil of IP2 treatment than monocropping treatment. The content of available potassium and microbial biomass carbon, as well as the activity of catalase, sucrase and protease, significantly decreased in intercropping root zone soil. Intercropping resulted in a significant increase by 7.8%, 16.2% and 23.0% in IS, IP1 and IP2, respectively, of the acid phosphatase content relative to MS. Metagenomic analysis showed that the pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were dominant and more abundant in intercropping than in monocropping. Moreover, the relative abundances of genes related to N cycling (glnA, GLUD1_2, nirK), P cycling (phoR, phoB) and organic matter turnover (PRDX2_4) were higher in the intercropping soil than in the monocropping soil. The relative abundance of GLUD1_2 and phoR were 25.5% and 13.8% higher in the IP2 treatment respectively,and bgIX was higher in IS treatment compared to the monocropping treatment. Genes that were significantly related to phosphorus metabolism and nitrogen metabolism (TREH, katE, gudB) were more abundant in intercropping than in monocropping. Conclusion. The results of this study indicate that the intercropping system changed the numbers of microbes as well as enzymes activities, and subsequently regulate genes involved in N cycling, P cycling and organic matter turnover. Finally, it leads to the increase of nutrients in root zone soil and improved the soil environment.",
1060,"Mapping lithological variations in a river basin of West Bengal, India using electrical resistivity survey: implications for artificial recharge Groundwater is a treasured earth's resource and plays an important role in addressing water and environmental sustainability. However, its overexploitation and wide spatial variability within a basin and/or across regions are posing a serious challenge for groundwater sustainability. Some parts of southern West Bengal of India are problematic for groundwater occurrence despite of high rainfall in this region. Characterization of an aquifer in this area is very important for sustainable development of water supply and artificial recharge. Electrical resistivity surveys using 1-D and 2-D arrays were performed at a regular interval from Subarnarekha River at Bhasraghat (south) to Kharagpur (north) to map the lithological variations in this area. Resistivity sounding surveys were carried out at an interval of 2-3km. Subsurface resistivity variation has been interpreted using very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) global optimization technique. The analysis of the field data indicated that the resistivity variation with depth is suitable in the southern part of the area and corresponds to clayey sand. Interpreted resistivity in the northern part of the area is relatively high and reveals impervious laterite layer. In the southern part of the area resistivity varies between 15 and 40m at a depth below 30m. A 2-D resistivity imaging conducted at the most important location in the area is correlated well with the 1-D results. Based on the interpreted resistivity variation with depth at different locations different types of geologic units (laterite, clay, sand, etc.) are classified, and the zone of interests for aquifer has been demarcated. Study reveals that southern part of the area is better for artificial recharge than the northern part. The presence of laterite cover in the northern part of the area restricts the percolation of rainwater to recharge the aquifer at depth. To recharge the aquifer at depth in the northern part of the area, rainwater must be sent artificially at depth by puncturing laterite layers on the top. Such studies in challenging areas will help in understanding the problems and finding its solution.",

Water resource is one of the most important factors limiting economic growth, which has been a hot topic among governments and international organizations. This study took Beijing city of China for an example to assess water carrying capacity (WRCC) based on the historical data from 2001 to 2010. Population size, economic scale and ecological environment were selected as main indices; the water carrying index, current WRCC in Beijing city and its dynamic tendency were evaluated. The results showed that the utilization of domestic water and ecological water accounted for the larger proportion. In addition water resources previously used for agriculture and industry systems tended to transfer to urban system due to rapid urbanization. This paper indicated that rational policies and measures should be established and implemented to make sure efficient water utilization in Beijing city.",
1063,"Validation and implementation of principles of the Integrated Pest Management concept - sustainability and current challenges in pest endemic pulse bowl of India Insect pests and vascular diseases are the major constraints to pigeonpea production in Karnataka and primarily responsible for lower productivity. There is no substantial host plant resistance to key insect pests in currently adopted cultivars, however effective utilization of other components of pest management led to development of various integrated pest management (IPM) to minimize yield losses and protect the environment. In present studies, it is a total ""system approach"" to sustainable pest management involving seed treatment with microbials, synchronized sowing, modification in landscape and application of need-based pesticide spray. Spray schedule was combined with online pest monitoring system for the plant protection related advisories for the target region. The resultant IPM package implemented through fanner-managed operational scale plots and compared with non-IPM (normal farmer practices) across 7 taluks of Gulbarga district for 4 years (2010-2013 seasons). A total of 2197 farmer-managed demonstrations were conducted, giving a 5-104% yield advantage (district means) of IPM over farmers' practice. Pest incidence data in IPM vis-a-vis non-IPM clearly indicates that pest can be managed by adopting IPM technology. Number of spray of pesticides could be reduced from 6 to 4. Pesticide residue analysis for 102 chemical pesticides for representative soil, water and grain samples drawn from IPM as well as non-IPM (farmers' practice) fields, indicates their presence within the prescribed limits. Grain yields in IPM plots were generally 15-20% higher than in FP. Even with all the available inputs, the production is subject to residual production risk due to abiotic constraints (rainfall), diseases and insect pests, which often large farmers are able to bear. Here in present studies it has been clearly demonstrated that strategies are friendly and adoptable by the small and marginal farmers. Effective implementation of IPM practices by participating farmers demonstrated that remunerative and reliable yields could be obtained in this pest-prone environment and helps mitigate climate induced threat to agricultural development having relevance to other pigeonpea growing regions prone to similar pest pests.",
1064,"Metagenomic resolution of microbial functions in deep-sea hydrothermal plumes across the Eastern Lau Spreading Center Microbial processes within deep-sea hydrothermal plumes affect ocean biogeochemistry on global scales. In rising hydrothermal plumes, a combination of microbial metabolism and particle formation processes initiate the transformation of reduced chemicals like hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, methane, iron, manganese and ammonia that are abundant in hydrothermal vent fluids. Despite the biogeochemical importance of this rising portion of plumes, it is understudied in comparison to neutrally buoyant plumes. Here we use metagenomics and bioenergetic modeling to describe the abundance and genetic potential of microorganisms in relation to available electron donors in five different hydrothermal plumes and three associated background deep-sea waters from the Eastern Lau Spreading Center located in the Western Pacific Ocean. Three hundred and thirty one distinct genomic 'bins' were identified, comprising an estimated 951 genomes of archaea, bacteria, eukarya and viruses. A significant proportion of these genomes is from novel microorganisms and thus reveals insights into the energy metabolism of heretofore unknown microbial groups. Community-wide analyses of genes encoding enzymes that oxidize inorganic energy sources showed that sulfur oxidation was the most abundant and diverse chemolithotrophic microbial metabolism in the community. Genes for sulfur oxidation were commonly present in genomic bins that also contained genes for oxidation of hydrogen and methane, suggesting metabolic versatility in these microbial groups. The relative diversity and abundance of genes encoding hydrogen oxidation was moderate, whereas that of genes for methane and ammonia oxidation was low in comparison to sulfur oxidation. Bioenergetic-thermodynamic modeling supports the metagenomic analyses, showing that oxidation of elemental sulfur with oxygen is the most dominant catabolic reaction in the hydrothermal plumes. We conclude that the energy metabolism of microbial communities inhabiting rising hydrothermal plumes is dictated by the underlying plume chemistry, with a dominant role for sulfur-based chemolithoautotrophy.",
1065,"Co-infection of Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E Viruses among the Acute Viral Hepatitis Cases in Tertiary Care Hospital -A Four Years Retrospective Study Acute viral hepatitis(AVH) is caused by Hepatitis A (HAV) and Hepatitis E(HEV). It is major health burden in India. Both the viruses HAV and HEV are primarily transmitted via the faeco-oral course. Study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of HAV, HEV and rate of co-infection in AVH patients attending rural tertiary care centre. A retrospective laboratory record based study was carried out in rural tertiary health care center located in Western Maharashtra. Laboratory and Medical records of suspected acute viral infection patients were analyzed during study. Study period was June 2014 to July 2018. Commercially available ELISA kits of IgM anti-HAV and IgM anti-HEV were used to analyze serum samples of suspected study participants. Tests were carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 778 acute viral hepatitis cases were included in the study from July 2014 to July 2018 among which 85/778 (10.9 %) detected positive for HAV and 121/778 (15.6%) detected positive for HEV. Co-infection was identified in 6/778(0.8 %). Jaundice, fever fatigue and hepatomegaly were common clinical presentation in HAV, HEV and confection with both viruses in acute viral hepatitis patients. Study indicated low exposure to HAV in childhood bellow 16 years. Co-infection rate was detected high in 16-25 years age group. Vaccination policy against HAV in adolescent age group needed as there is change epidemiological shift of HAV which has been observed in the current study. These data will helps for planning future vaccination strategies, better implementation sanitation program, and safe water supply in this geographic area.",
1066,"Risk Factors for Undernutrition and Diarrhea Prevalence in an Urban Slum in Indonesia: Focus on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation and hygiene lead to deterioration of the child health condition in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional and health status of children living in an urban slum and to clarify the factors contributing to undernutrition and diarrhea prevalence by focusing on water, sanitation, and hygiene from three viewpoints: household environments, child personal hygiene practices, and knowledge and awareness. The study was conducted at a preschool and two elementary schools in the densely populated area of Bandung, Indonesia. Participants were 228 pairs of children and their caretakers. The survey involved 1) anthropometric measurements (height and weight), 2) handwashing observation using a checklist, and 3) questionnaires. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, not using a towel for handwashing practices (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-4.96) was significantly associated with an increased risk of stunting. Regarding household environments, children from households using tap water as drinking water were significantly associated with an increased risk of stunting and thinness compared with households using tank water (AOR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.03-4.93; and AOR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.13-7.35, respectively). Moreover, children from households using open containers for water storage were significantly associated with an increased risk of diarrhea (AOR = 5.01; 95% CI = 1.08-23.15). Therefore, drinking water management at home and proper personal hygiene practices of children are important for maintaining and promoting child health in urban Indonesian slums.",
1067,"Longitudinal assessment of rainwater quality under tropical climatic conditions in enabling effective rainwater harvesting and reuse schemes A longitudinal harvested rainwater quality monitoring study was undertaken at 6 sites within Selangor, Malaysia over a period of 8 months. Overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the Malaysian recreational water quality Class BB standards with exceptions for pH (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). A large number of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and Chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in Malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. Mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. Rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. Last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. The results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. Both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

1068,"Associations between urinary total arsenic levels, fetal development, and neonatal birth outcomes: A cohort study in Taiwan Background: Arsenic exposure is a global health concern. Several studies have focused on chronic arsenic exposure in adults; however, limited data are available regarding the potential adverse effects of prenatal exposure on fetuses and neonates. Objectives: To assess which time point maternal arsenic exposure may influence the fetus during pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods: In this study, total arsenic concentrations were analyzed in urine samples collected from 130 women with singleton pregnancies (22-45 years old) in Taiwan from March to December of 2010. All fetal biometric measurements in each trimester period and birth outcomes at delivery were obtained. We applied a generalized estimating equation model and multivariate regression models to evaluate the associations between maternal urinary total arsenic (UtAs) exposure during pregnancy, fetal biometric measurements, and neonatal birth outcomes. Results: We observed statistically significant correlations between maternal UtAs levels and the fetal biparietal diameter over all three trimesters (beta = -1.046 mm, p < 0.05). Multiple regression analyses showed a negative association between maternal UtAs levels and chest circumference in the first trimester (beta = -0.721 cm, p < 0.05), and second-trimester UtAs exposure was associated with decreases in birth weight (beta = -173.26 g, p < 0.01), head circumference (beta = -0.611 cm, p < 0.05), and chest circumference (beta = -0.654 cm, p < 0.05). Dose-response relationships were also observed for maternal UtAs exposure and birth outcomes. Conclusions: We identified a negative relationship between maternal UtAs levels during pregnancy, fetal development, and neonatal birth outcomes. These findings should be confirmed in future studies with large sample sizes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1069,"THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF ARSENIC IN AGRICULTURE: IRRIGATION WATER, SOIL AND CROPS, STATE OF THE ART The existence of high content of arsenic exceeding international regulations stablished for irrigation water can be the main factor for the relationship of arsenic content found in soil and crops of many countries around the world such as Bangladesh, Mexico and Spain. The drinking water is not the only source of consumption of arsenic in human diet. Irrigating agricultural fields with arsenic contaminated water produces accumulation of arsenic in soil and subsequently an increases of arsenic concentration in crops. Concentration of arsenic in crops depends of many factors, for example, type of crop, arsenic concentration of soil and water, soil type, among others. In this paper, data from several studies are presented to show that arsenic in irrigation water tends to accumulate in agricultural soil and through several mechanisms is absorbed by crops. The problem of arsenic in agriculture requires more research that allows to know the actual situation and to propose solutions in order to solve some cases and avoid others.",
1070,"Three-dimensional reservoir architecture modeling by geostatistical techniques in BD block, Jinhu depression, northern Jiangsu Basin, China To reduce or avoid some of the ambiguities in a heterogeneous reservoir, a fine three-dimensional model would be inevitably established with the application of geostatistical techniques. BD oilfield is a low-permeability fractured reservoir with many fracture types, which composes a multi-azimuthal fracture system, causing strong anisotropy and heterogeneity. Moreover, fracture provides not only accumulation space for oil and gas but also channels for migration of hydrocarbons and water dashing and thus plays a leading role in controlling BD reservoir production. With the continuous exploitation of oil in reservoir for more than 30 years, BD oilfield has currently stepped into high water cut stage, exposing many problems such as low oil recovery, poor exploitation stability, rapid oil production decline, and one-way water intrusion. Therefore, a detailed reservoir characterization, constructed to describe reservoir behavior under strong water drive in a well-developed fractured reservoir, is urgently needed. In this study, combined with three-dimensional geostatistical techniques, an accurate and efficient reservoir parameter model that occurs in a strong heterogeneous fractured reservoir has been constructed through stratigraphic correlation and sedimentary facies analysis. Hence, all the study presented above will be available for well location, remaining oil potential-tapping and oil recovery improvement during the later study work.",
1071,"Assessment of Groundwater Quality in the Talensi District, Northern Ghana A comprehensive chemical quality assessment of groundwater resources in the Talensi District has been conducted using conventional graphical methods and multivariate statistical techniques. The study sought to determine the main controls of groundwater chemistry and its suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes in the district. Silicate and carbonate mineral weathering were identified as the main controls on groundwater chemistry in the district, with reverse ion exchange also playing a role. High nitrate and lead levels observed have been associated with agrochemicals and wastewater from farms and homes. Three main flow regimes have been identified with Q-mode cluster analysis, in which mixed cation water types have been revealed, where areas designated as recharge zones are dominated by Na(+)â€‰+â€‰K(+)-Mg(2+)-HCO(3) (-) fresh water types characterised by low mineralisation and pH, which evolve into Mg(2+)- Na(+)â€‰+â€‰K(+)- HCO(3) (-) fresh water type with corresponding increased mineralisation of the groundwater. Based on the water quality index (WQI) technique modified for the district and an interpolation technique using ordinary kriging developed from a well-fitted exponential semivariogram for the estimated WQIs, the groundwater quality has been spatially classified as generally 'good' to 'excellent' for domestic purposes. Generally, the quality of groundwater for domestic usage deteriorates as one moves towards the north of the district, whereas waters in the east and west present the best quality. Classifications based on the United States Salinity Laboratory (USSL), Wilcox, and Doneen diagrams suggest that groundwater from the unconfined aquifers of the district is of excellent quality for irrigation purposes.",1
1072,"The assessment of emerging data-intelligence technologies for modeling Mg(+2) and SO(4)(-2) surface water quality The concentration of soluble salts in surface water and rivers such as sodium, sulfate, chloride, magnesium ions, etc., plays an important role in the water salinity. Therefore, accurate determination of the distribution pattern of these ions can improve better management of drinking water resources and human health. The main goal of this research is to establish two novel wavelet-complementary intelligence paradigms so-called wavelet least square support vector machine coupled with improved simulated annealing (W-LSSVM-ISA) and the wavelet extended Kalman filter integrated with artificial neural network (W-EKF- ANN) for accurate forecasting of the monthly), magnesium (Mg(+2)), and sulfate (SO(4)(-2)) indices at Maroon River, in Southwest of Iran. The monthly River flow (Q), electrical conductivity (EC), Mg(+2), and SO(4)(-2) data recorded at Tange-Takab station for the period 1980-2016. Some preprocessing procedures consisting of specifying the number of lag times and decomposition of the existing original signals into multi-resolution sub-series using three mother wavelets were performed to develop predictive models. In addition, the best subset regression analysis was designed to separately assess the best selective combinations for Mg(+2) and SO(4)(-2). The statistical metrics and authoritative validation approaches showed that both complementary paradigms yielded promising accuracy compared with standalone artificial intelligence (AI) models. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that W-LSSVM-ISA-C1 (correlation coefficient (R)Â =Â 0.9521, root mean square error (RMSE)Â =Â 0.2637Â mg/l, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE)Â =Â 0.9361) and W-LSSVM-ISA-C4 (RÂ =Â 0.9673, RMSEÂ =Â 0.5534Â mg/l and KGEÂ =Â 0.9437), using Dmey mother that outperformed the W-EKF-ANN for predicting Mg(+2) and SO4(-2), respectively.",
1073,"Transformation of haematite and Al-poor goethite to Al-rich goethite and associated yellowing in a ferralitic clay soil profile of the middle Amazon Basin (Manaus, Brazil) The red and yellow colours of ferralitic soils in the tropics have for long intrigued pedologists. We have investigated the upward yellowing in a 10-m thick profile representative of the Ferralsols of the plateaux of the Manaus region of Brazil. We determined changes in the nature and crystal chemistry of their Fe oxides by optical and Mossbauer spectroscopy as well as Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns. We attribute the upward yellowing of the soil to a progressive transformation of the Fe oxides at nearly invariant iron contents. Aluminium in contrast is strongly mobilized in the uppermost clay-depleted topsoil where there is preferential dissolution of kaolinite and crystallization of gibbsite. Haematite decreases from 35 to 10% of the Fe oxides from the bottom to the top of the profile and the particles become smaller (75-10 nm). Its Al for Fe-substitution remains almost unchanged (10-15 mol %). The average Al-substitution rate of goethite increases from 25 to 33 mol %, and its mean crystal diameter remains in the range 20-40 nm. The proportion of Al-rich goethite (33 mol %) increases at the expense of less Al-substituted Fe oxides (haematite and goethite). This conversion with restricted transfer of iron means that the amount of Al stored in Fe oxides gradually increases. Kaolinite, haematite and Al-poor goethite are thus witnesses of earlier stages of ferralitization of the soil. In contrast, Al-rich goethite and gibbsite initiate the alitization (or bauxitization) of the soil. They correspond to the last generation of soil minerals, which most likely reflects the present-day weathering conditions. The progressive replacement of kaolinite, haematite and Al-poor goethite by new generations of Al-rich goethite and gibbsite attests to greater activities of water and aluminium and smaller activity of aqueous silica in the topsoil than in the subsoil. We interpret this as a consequence of longer periods of wetting in the topsoil that could result from soil aging, more humid climate or both.",
1074,"Nonchemical based integrated management package for live-wood eating termites in tea plantations of north-east India Live wood eating termites are responsible for considerable damage to young and mature teas throughout North-East India. Termite infestation leads not only to economic loss but also to the failure of several years of effort to grow tea plants. This study reveals the efficacy of various non-chemical approaches to control the termite problem in Assam tea plantation. Two multiplication field trials consisted of twelve non-chemical treatments were conducted following randomized block design (RBD) with three replications. The trials revealed that Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, Heterorhabditis indica and Ipomea carnea were effective in controlling the termites in tea compared to the check (thiamethoxam, a commonly used chemical pesticide against termites in conventional tea estates) as well as to control (untreated- water spray for both organic and conventional tea estates). Along with these non-chemical treatments, an integrated management package for termite control is discussed.",
1075,"Life cycle assessment of a biogas system for cassava processing in Brazil to close the loop in the water-waste-energy-food nexus Biogas, generated from anaerobic digester (AD), has been one of the promising sources of renewable energy. To manage the organic waste from small cassava industry in Brazil, a waste-water-energy-food nexus (WWEF) system is proposed, combining AD and co-generation or combined heat and power (CHP) plants. However, the environmental impacts and benefits of this system are yet not known. By using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, environmental impacts of three scenarios are assessed, i.e. business-as-usual (base), improved business-as-usual and WWEF closed-loop. Functional unit (FU) in this study is defined as generating 1 kg cassava starch/flour. Global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (CED), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP), terrestrial acidification potential (TAP) and water depletion potential (WDP) are selected. Landfilling cassava waste, power use for cassava starch and flour production, and emissions from fertilizer application are identified as environmental hotspots for business-as-usual case, suggesting making decisions on these aspects when dealing with environmental impacts. By using cassava waste to recover energy and nutrients for Brazilian rural family farming, the WWEF system is identified as the best environment-friendly scenario with lowest environmental impacts for the selected impact categories. The impact savings of the closed-loop scenario for GWP are over 90%, while over 50% of emissions for other selected impact categories, except FEP (lower than 10%), are saved compared to the business-as-usual and improved scenarios. Sensitivity analysis reinforces the results. Overall, this study provides a view on the potential of using cassava waste for the WWEF closed-loop system in Brazil, suggesting that the proposed WWEF closed- loop system is feasible and beneficial for small industries from the environmental perspective.

1076,"Interesterification of butter fat by partially purified extracellular lipases from Pseudomonas putida, Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae Three extracellular lipases were produced by batch fermentation of Pseudomonas putida ATCC 795, Aspergillus niger CBS 131.52 and Rhizopus oryzae ATCC 34612 during the late phase of growth, at 72, 96 and 96 h, respectively. The lipases were partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. The lipase of P. putida was optimal at pH 8.0 whereas those from A. niger and R. oryzae were optimal at pH 7.5. The A. niger lipase had the lowest V max value (0.51Ã—10(-3) U/min) and R. oryzae the highest (1.86Ã—10(-3) U/min). The K m values for P. putida, A. niger and R. oryzae lipases were 1.18, 0.97, and 0.98 mg/ml, respectively. Native PAGE of the partially-purified lipase extracts showed two to four major bands. The interesterification of butter fat by A. niger lipase decreased the water activity as well as the hydrolytic activity. The A. niger lipase had the highest interesterification yield value (26%) and the R. oryzae lipase the lowest (4%). In addition, A. niger lipase exhibited the highest decrease (17%) in long-chain hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0 and C16:0) at the sn-2-position; the P. putida lipase demonstrated the least favourable changes in specificity at the same position.

1077,"Identification of roxarsone metabolites produced in the system: Soil-chlorinated water-light by using HPLC-ICP-MS/ESI-MS, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS and High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) Roxarsone (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylarsonic acid) in contact with soil of volcanic origin and chlorine containing water generated a set of organoarsenicals. The transformation products were identified with element-specific (ICP-MS) as well as molecular-specific (ESI-MS) detection after their HPLC separation. The identification of the main transformation products by means of ESI-MS, ESI-MS/MS and ESI-TOF-MS adduce evidence of chlorinated phenylarsonic acids and a phenylarsine oxide derivative which contains arsenic in the trivalent state. Traces of chlorine in water used for sorption experiments are suggested to be responsible for the formation of chlorinated products. After irradiation of a roxarsone solution with visible light, different transformation product so far not identified were detected.",
1078,"The effects of petroleum exploration and production operations on the heavy metals contents of soil and groundwater in the Niger Delta Soil and water samples obtained from four sampling points; around an oil well head, flare site, waste pit and effluent discharge point in an exploration area in the Niger Delta were analysed for their heavy metals contents. The results showed that the amount of lead present in the soil ranges from 3.40 - 99.40 mg/kg, copper values were in the range of 5.10 - 49.30 mg/kg, Nickel concentration vary from 1.60 - 13.80 mg/kg, values for cadmium, iron, zinc, and chromium were 0.04 - 0.95 mg/kg, 536.00 - 12,872.00 mg/kg, 11.1 - 274.00 mg/kg and 1.30 - 165.00 mg/kg respectively. Apart from zinc and nickel, all other heavy metals were higher than the toxicity limits for heavy metals in natural soil; this implies pollution of the soil by heavy metals. Also the waters were found to be polluted by lead, the pH of the water samples was found to deviate significantly from DPR limits and W.H.O. standard for potable water. This also implies pollution. Remediation measures were suggested so as to render the soil and ground water fit for use.",1
1079,"Application of static and dynamic artificial neural networks for forecasting inflow discharges, case study: Sefidroud Dam reservoir Accurate forecasting of reservoir inflow is of great importance in water resources planning and management and it can highly affect decisions and policies of reservoir operation with respect to flood control, drought management, water supply, and hydropower generation. In this study, different models of static and dynamic artificial neural networks (ANN) including static feed forward neural network (FFNN), nonlinear autoregressive (NAR), and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) are employed in order to forecast Sefidroud Dam reservoir inflows. The capability of studied networks with a range of different input variables in predicting reservoir inflows are then compared. All employed models are trained using inflow discharge and precipitation data with different time delays and an optimum number of neurons in the hidden layers are obtained. In addition, the time index (T) is also employed as the input data to the proposed models in order to increase the accuracy of the estimates. The obtained results indicate that NAR dynamic neural network has a better performance in comparison with FFNN and NARX models. Furthermore, using 12 time delays for inflow discharges and precipitation data leads to the best accessible results where adding time index (T) increases the accuracy. The results obtained from this study provide useful information for reservoir inflow simulation. In other words, these results are critical for water resources management and planning particularly in the field of dam reservoir operation which is crucial under reported water crisis in Iran.

1080,"Enhancing water productivity at the irrigation system level: A geospatial hydrology application in the Yellow River Basin This paper provides results of an application of a holistic systematic approach of water accounting using remote sensing and GIS coupled with groundwater modeling to evaluate water saving options by tracking non-beneficial evaporation in the Liuyuankou Irrigation System (LIS) of China. Groundwater rise is a major issue in the LIS, where groundwater levels have risen alarmingly close to the ground surface (within 1 m) near the Yellow River. The lumped water balance analysis showed high fallow evaporation losses and which need to be reduced for improving water productivity. The seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETs) was estimated by applying the SEBAL algorithm for 18 NOAA AVHRR-12 images over the year of 1990-1991 (April 1990-March 1991). This analysis was aided by the unsupervised land use classification applied to three Landsat 5 TM images of the study area. SEBAL results confirmed that a fair amount (116.7 MCM) of water can be saved by reducing evaporation from fallow land which will result in improved water productivity at the irrigation system. The water accounting indicator (for the analysis period) shows that the process fraction per unit of depleted water (PFdepleted) is 0.52 for LIS, meaning that 52% of the depleted water is consumed by agricultural crops and 48% is lost through non-process depletion. Finally, the groundwater modeling was applied to simulate three land use and water management interventions to assess their effectiveness for both water savings and impact on the groundwater in LIS. MODFLOW's Zone Budget code calculates the groundwater budget of user-specified subregions, the exchange of flows between subregions and also calculates a volumetric water budget for the entire model at the end of each time step. The simulation results showed that fallow evaporation could be reduced between 14.2% (25.51 MCM) and 45.3% (81.36 MCM) by interventions such as canal lining and groundwater pumping. The reduction in non-beneficial ET, volumes would mean that more water would be available for other uses and it would allow the introduction of more surface water supplies in the area through improved water management strategies. This will ultimately lead to improved water productivity of the LIS system. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1081,"Statistical optimization of arsenic removal from synthetic water by electrocoagulation system and its application with real arsenic-polluted groundwater Arsenic presence in the water has become one of the most concerning environmental problems. Electrocoagulation is a technology that offers several advantages over conventional treatments such as chemical coagulation. In the present work, an electrocoagulation system was optimized for arsenic removal at initial concentrations of 100â€…Âµg/L using response surface methodology. The effects of studied parameters were determined by a 2(3) factorial design, whereas treatment time had a positive effect and current intensity had a negative effect on arsenic removal efficiency. With a p-value of 0.1629 and a confidence of level 99%, the type of electrode material did not have a significant effect on arsenic removal. Efficiency over 90% was reached at optimal operating conditions of 0.2â€…A of current intensity, and 7â€…min of treatment time using iron as the electrode material. However, the time necessary to accomplish with OMS arsenic guideline of 10â€…Âµg/L increased from 7 to 30â€…min when real arsenic-contaminated groundwater with an initial concentration of 80.2â€‰Â±â€‰3.24â€…Âµg/L was used. The design of a pilot-scale electrocoagulation reactor was determined with the capacity to meet the water requirement of a 6417 population community in Sonora, Mexico.

Clinical gold standard technique of culture-based method followed by biochemical tests demand 72+ hours for diagnosis while newly developed techniques (like PCR, RT-PCR, DNA microarray etc.) suffer from high limit of detection or involve high-cost infrastructure or both. In this work, a quick and highly specific method, SMOL was established for simultaneous detection of Salmonella paratyphi A and Salmonella typhi in clinical blood samples. SMOL consists of (i) pre-concentration of S. typhi and S. paratyphi A cells using magnetic nanoparticles followed by (ii) cell lysis and DNA extraction (iii) amplification of select nucleic acids by LAMP technique and (iv) detection of amplified nucleic acids using an affordable portable device (costs less than $70). To identify the viability of target cells at lower concentrations, the samples were processed at two different time periods of t = 0 and t = 4 h. Primers specific for the SPA2539 gene in S. paratyphi A and STY2879 gene in S. typhi were used for LAMP. Within 6 h SMOL was able to detect positive and negative samples from 55 human clinical blood culture samples and detect the viability of the cells. The results were concordant with culture and biochemical tests as well as by qPCR. Statistical power analysis yielded 100%. SMOL results were concordant with culture and biochemical tests as well as by qPCR. The sensitive and affordable system SMOL will be effective for poor resource settings.",

1084,"Optimization of multiple fillers used for removal of water pollutants of large well near the river in Northern China In this paper, chromium (Cr(VI)), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and ammonia nitrogen in synthetically polluted well water were treated in three columns packed with different fillers to compare treatment effects. The concentrations of Cr(VI), COD, and ammonia nitrogen were used to investigate processing efficiency and find the most efficient column and fillers. Several effective fillers were scanned by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to discover the removing mechanism. Results showed No.1 column with iron powder, activated carbon, and artificial zeolite in series exerted the best ability to remove pollutants. Total removal rate of No.1 column for Cr(VI), COD, and ammonia nitrogen was 91.7%, 47.1%, and 81.6%, respectively. Iron powder removed 86.6% of Cr(VI), activated carbon removed 30.1% of COD, and artificial zeolite removed 66.9% of ammonia nitrogen. The ability of iron powder to remove Cr(VI) is attributed to the redox reaction between iron powder and Cr(VI). Removal of COD by activated carbon is based on the adsorption of activated carbon. Artificial zeolite contains a variety of cationic components and is capable of removing ammonia nitrogen from the water by ion exchange. The No.1 column process has higher reference values for the pretreatment of polluted well water in the towns of underdeveloped countries. Â© IWA Publishing 2019.",
1085,"Bioremediation of industrial pharmaceutical drugs Recently, attention has been drawn toward the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. In recent years, many reports have been made on the occurrence of the large, differentiated group of pharmaceuticals in wastewater (PW), surface water, ground water, and in soil. The pharmaceutical sector is currently expanding in Tunisia, with more than 34 industries. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 to treat PW. P. putida was very efficient in reducing chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity of solution (85.5, 89.1, and 81.5%, respectively). Genotoxicity of effluent, before and after biodegradation, was evaluated in vivo in mouse bone marrow by assessing the percentage of cells bearing different chromosome aberrations. Results indicated that PW showed a significant ability to induce DNA damage. In addition, PW induced a remarkable lipid peroxidation (LPO) effect, however, activities of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were unchanged when treated with PW, compared to nontreated PW. This toxicity was imputed to the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater. However, chromosome aberration, as well as LPO of PW, were significantly reduced after bioremediation. Thus, the use of this strain for testing on the industrial scale seems possible and advantageous.",

The objective of this study is to model the speciation of commonly-occurring and sometimes health-threatening trace contaminants, and then to evaluate the impact of speciation on fluoride, arsenic, and magnesium retention by NF/RO. A series of experiments were performed in central Australia in late 2005 to assess elemental retention with four different membrane modules (BW30, ESPA4, NF90, and TFC-S) at various pH values between 3 and 11 at two different source waters (Pine Hill Station and Ti Tree Farm). The removal of fluoride and arsenic was observed to be independent of pH, while magnesium removal is pH dependent. Compound speciation is considered to explain dependence observations. Membrane type was found to impact retention. The results obtained in this study will provide valuable information on the reliability and the optimization windows of the renewable energy powered desalination system that has been developed.",
1087,"Effects of land use change on biodiversity and ecosystem services in tropical montane cloud forests of Mexico Tropical montane cloud forests deliver important goods and services to society, such as timber, the supply and purification of fresh water, and carbon sequestration. In spite of their relevance, current deforestation rates are very high, at the expense of affecting the provision of ecosystem services. We explore the impact of land use change in terms of provision of ecosystem services by following two approaches, one very detailed (focused on hydrological services - water quality) and another one with a broader perspective (at a large scale and considering the ecosystem service value (ESV) of several ecosystems and their ecosystem services at the same time). In the highlands of the State of Veracruz, previously forested lands were converted into coffee plantations and cattle ranches. To evaluate the role of species composition and community structure on water quality, we studied nine small watersheds (<15 ha) covered by pristine cloud forest, coffee plantations and cultivated grassland (three each). Species richness of the three land use types was similar, although species composition was as different as 90% Overall species diversity as well as that of woody species, and growth form diversities decreased in the transformed land uses. Water quality of streams flowing through these watersheds declined: nutrients (nitrate), conductivity, cations. chloride and suspended solids were lowest in the forest streams and highest in streams from coffee watersheds, whereas grasslands were intermediate We also calculated ecosystem service values (using the transfer value method) and estimated economic market-non-market gains and losses owing to land transformation. Loss of natural ecosystems may imply a significant economic loss to society in terms of ecosystem services, although market gains may still lead land owners to land conversion because revenues are higher. Adequate Payment for Ecosystem Services may be a good option to prevent deforestation, but the compensation should be at least equal to the opportunity cost of the promoted land use. Our estimates are indicative of the urgent need to go beyond water quantity as the most relevant ecosystem service considered in PES schemes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1088,"Interannual phytoplankton dynamics of a hypertrophic African lake Phytoplankton species composition and abundance were recorded weekly or biweekly for nearly 7 years in a hypertrophic lake (Hartbeespoort Dam, South Africa), together with a range of physical and chemical parameters. A total of 73 species were recorded, of which only 20 were occasionally abundant, and only 5 became dominant (>50% of total biomass) at least once (Microcystis aeruginosa, Oocystis lacustris, Aulacoseira (= Melosira) granulata, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Carteria cordiformis). The earlier years of the study (1982-1986) were drought years characterized by low water levels (10-15 m below the level at full supply), excess supply of nutrients at all times of the year, and overwhelming dominance of Microcystis aeruginosa. This K-selected species proved to be well adapted to withstand the range of environmental conditions throughout summer, fall and winter but it declined in spring each year when a fast successional episode followed. Several small-celled chlorophytes, diatoms and cryptophytes appeared and disappeared until Oocystis lacrustris became dominant for a few weeks, to be replaced by M. aeruginosa early in the summer. During the following rainy years (late 1986 to 1988), the lake re-filled. Major washout losses, concomitant with a considerable decline in surface water phosphorus concentrations and elevated TN/TP ratios, apparently led to the reduction in the abundance of M. aeruginosa. Its bloom extended over a smaller portion of the year in 1986 and 1987, and disappeared in May 1988, permitting the development of a more diverse phytoplankton community subject to control by 2ooplankton grazing. This long-term phytoplankton record from Hartbeespoort Dam demonstrates the key role of a dominant species in controlling community composition and diversity in hypertrophic lakes. Stable environments lead to low-diversity and high-biomass phytoplankton assemblages dominated by K-strategists, while disruptions of suitable strength and frequency allow for the development and maintenance of higher species diversity.",
1089,"Integrating Ecological Assessments to Target Priority Restoration Areas: A Case Study in the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration, China The identification and management of ecological restoration areas play important roles in promoting sustainable urban development. However, current research lacks a scientific basis for the scope and scale of ecological restoration. Further, the absence of a framework to assess policy goals and public preferences that leads to identification of ecological restoration areas across the science-policy interface is difficult, and the existing frameworks' performance has little applicability. We proposed a transdisciplinary framework to combine ecological quality, ecological health, and ecosystem services as an assessment endpoint to identify priority restoration areas. Further, we classified the ecological restoration areas on a township scale by K-means. Based upon policy goals and public preferences of the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration, we chose air quality, biodiversity, soil fragility, recreation quality, ecosystem vigor, landscape metrics, and the water supply ecosystem service as elements of the evaluation system. This study showed that priority restoration areas accounted for 10.8% of the urban agglomeration area and classified township, largely in the difference between natural and semi-natural ecosystems and the human environment. Policymakers can use this framework comprehensively and flexibly to identify and classify ecological restoration areas to achieve policy goals and fulfil public preferences.",
1090,"Temporal dimension and water quality control in an emission trading scheme based on water environmental functional zone Emission trading is one of the most effective alternatives to controlling water pollution. Water environmental functional zone (WEFZ) is used to determine the water quality standard and identify the zone boundary for each river or reach. In this study, a new emission trading scheme was addressed based on WEFZ, accounting for both the temporal dimension and water quality control. A temporal factor of emission trading was proposed based on variations in the environmental capacity within a year by dividing the year into three periods, including high, normal, and low periods of environmental capacity. During each period, emission trading was implemented exclusively. A water quality-control scheme was suggested based on the water quality requirement in the water functional zone, in which the water quality at the downstream boundary of the zone was required to meet the water standard following auto-purification in the stream. Two methods of calculating water quality control are addressed for point-source pollution and non-point-source pollution. The calculated temporal dimension and water quality control were located in Dongxi River of the Daning Watershed in the Three Gorges Watershed. The high period was during June, July, and August, the normal period was during April, May, September, and October, and the low period was during January, February, March, November, and December. The results from the water quality calculation demonstrated that the discharge of point-source and non-point-source pollutions led to an excess of common contaminants at the downstream boundary of WEFZ. The temporal and spatial factors above should be incorporated into the emission trading scheme based on WEFZ.",
1091,"Effects of urbanization and land-use type on monthly extreme temperatures in a developing semi-arid region, Turkey Climate change is a great concern and attracted attention of many researchers in the world. A study was conducted to determine the effects of regional parameters such as population change (Delta P), number of motor-driven vehicles (NMDV), area covered by industrial crops (A), number of buildings (NB), and monthly extreme temperature trends in a developing semi-arid southeast region of Turkey, known as GAP area. Monthly extreme temperature series observed at 16 observation stations, covering the period of 1932-2002, with record length varying between 27 and 71 years, were utilized. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall test procedure was employed to detect monthly trends. Multiple and univariate linear regression analysis were employed to relate Mann-Kendall test statistic Z to the regional parameters. Spatial coverage maps of statistically significant upward and downward trends for each month were produced by using inverse distance squared weighting (IDSW) method. The most widespread upward trend was determined in January and July covering 42.9% and 40.9% of total area for maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperatures. There were no statistically significant (P <= 0.05) downward trends for extreme temperature series in the area studied. Multiple regression analysis (overall model) results revealed that determination coefficients for T-max and T-min were the highest as 94.0% in August and 87.8% in June. Univariate regression analysis led us to conclude that Delta P and A were the most important parameters to detect trends in T-min and T-max series. Mann-Kendall test statistic Z for T-max in summer time was negatively correlated with A. This was likely due to direct human influence through irrigation practices as well as the construction of large man-made water bodies in the region. The Delta P, NMDV, and NB were positively correlated with T-min, indicating that the cool period is gradually becoming warmer with time. We concluded that, as the area sown with industrial crops increases, there is a decrease in maximum temperatures due to the evaporative cooling mechanism. Increase in urbanization and/or industrialization, causes an increase in minimum temperatures in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1092,"Atmospheric Deposition and Heavy Metal Contamination in an Organic Farming System in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Region of India Increased consciousness about agricultural sustainability and health risks associated with agrochemicals has lead organic farming to be a globally emerging alternative farm practice. We report the effect of atmospheric deposition on soil quality and heavy metal contamination of agricultural produce under an organic farming system using wheat and corn as test crops. Data obtained in the open field (OFO) were compared with a plastic-covered glass-house-grown system (OFG). The results showed that depositions of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn increased with time. Soil porosity, water holding capacity, microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), substrate-induced respiration (SIR), alkaline phosphatase, and FDAase activity decreased, whereas the bulk density and contents of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn increased over time in open plots receiving atmospheric deposition. Concentrations of metals in grains in OFO crops exceeded the safe limits of Indian standards and were three to sixfold higher than those recorded in OFG plots. These results indicate that atmospheric deposition of heavy metals can have a destabilizing effect on soil fertility in organic farming and can greatly increase the dietary intake of toxic metals. This may have long-term implications for human health as well as for agricultural sustainability. The data presented here have particular concern for developing countries, where unprecedented urban-industrial growth and consequently increased input fluxes of heavy metals will continue for decades to come.",
1093,"A Systematic Review on Prevention and Treatment of Nipple Pain and Fissure: Are They Curable? Averagely 80% to 90% of breastfeeding women experience the nipple pain and fissures. The important factor for successful breastfeeding is to treat this problem. This study has done as a review with the aim of analysis of the clinical trials in the field of the prevention and treatment of the nipple fissures and pain due to the importance of breastfeeding. For this purpose, the key words of sore, nipples, fissure, trauma, wound, prevention, treatment, therapeutics, therapy, clinical trial, breastfeeding and their Persian synonyms and all of their possible combinations were searched in the national databases: SID and Iran Medex and Magiran, and in the international databases: PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Science direct by May 2017. The Jadad criterion was used to assess the quality of the articles and the articles with a score of 3 or more were included in this study. Finally, 48 clinical trials were reviewed that 17 of them (sample size 1801) scored 3 or more based on the Jadad criterion. Seven articles were also in the non-drug treatment group (sample size 491) and 2 articles in the drug treatment group (sample size 337) and 8 articles in the herbal treatment group (sample size 973). The results show that menthol and warm water compress as well as teaching the correct breastfeeding methods are effective treatments to prevent and treat the nipple pain and fissures. Moreover, applying the herbal medicine for prevention and treatment of the issues raised from breastfeeding may have beneficial such as Aloe vera, Portulaca olearacea. However, more studies with a great methodology are necessary to obtain more accurate evidence.",
1094,"The research of groundwater flow model in Ejina Basin, Northwestern China Water resources is a primary controlling factor for economical development and ecological environmental protection in the inland river basins of arid western China. Groundwater, as the important component of total water resources, plays a dominant role in the development of western China. In recent years, with the utilization ratio of surface water raised, the groundwater recharge rate has been reduced by surface water, and groundwater was exploited on a large-scale. This has led to the decline of groundwater levels and the degradation of eco-environments in the lower reaches of Heihe watershed, especially. Therefore, the study on the groundwater-level change in recent years, as well as simulating and predicting groundwater levels changes in the future is very significant to improve the ecological environment of the Heihe River Basin, coordinate the water contradiction, and allocate the water resources. The purpose of this study is to analyze the groundwater-level variations of the Ejina region basin on a large-scale, to develop and evaluate a conceptual groundwater model in Ejina Basin; according to the experimental observation data, to establish the groundwater flow model combining MODFLOW and GIS Software; simulated the regional hydrologic regime in recent 10 years and compared with various delivery scenarios from midstream; determined which one would be the best plan for maintaining and recovering the groundwater levels and increasing the area of Ejina Oasis. Finally, this paper discusses the possible vegetation changes of Ejina Basin in the future.",
1095,"Reduction of acid rock drainage using steel slag in cover systems over sulfide rock waste piles The extraction of gold, coal, nickel, uranium, copper and other earth-moving activities almost always leads to environmental damage. In metal and coal extraction, exposure of sulfide minerals to the atmosphere leads to generation of acid rock drainage (ARD) and in underground mining to acid mine drainage (AMD) due to contamination of infiltrating groundwater. This study proposes to develop a reactive cover system that inhibits infiltration of oxygen and also releases alkalinity to increase the pH of generated ARD and attenuate metal contaminants at the same time. The reactive cover system is constructed using steel slag, a waste product generated from steel industries. This study shows that this type of cover system has the potential to reduce some of the adverse effects of sulfide mine waste disposal on land. Geochemical and geotechnical characterization tests were carried out. Different proportions of sulfide mine waste and steel slag were studied in leachate extraction tests. The best proportion was 33% of steel slag in dry weight. Other tests were conducted as follows: soil consolidation, saturated permeability and soil water characteristic curve. The cover system was numerically modeled through unsaturated flux analysis using Vadose/w. The solution proposed is an oxygen transport barrier that allows rain water percolation to treat the ARD in the waste rock pile. The results showed that the waste pile slope is an important factor and the cover system must have 5â€‰m thickness to achieve an acceptable effectiveness.",
1096,"Evaluation of tradeoffs in land and water productivity of dry seeded rice as affected by irrigation schedule Management strategies that increase water productivity and reduce labour requirement while maintaining or increasing land productivity are urgently needed. Dry seeded rice (DSR) has been proposed as one of the technologies to achieve these objectives, but little is known about tradeoffs between land and water productivity of rice as affected by irrigation schedule. This study tested the ability of the ORYZA2000 model to simulate the effects of irrigation schedule of DSR on yield, various measures of water productivity, and soil water dynamics. The study showed that under conditions of no or mild water stress (up to 20 kPa SWT) ORYZA2000 performs well in simulating the effects of irrigation schedule on crop growth, yield, soil water dynamics, water balance components and water productivity of DSR in north-west India. However, the model overpredicted crop growth and yield at higher irrigation thresholds (40 and 70 kPa) which was atleast partially due to the fact that the DSR suffered from iron deficiency at higher irrigation thresholds. Using weather data for 40 rice seasons, the model predicted that there is always some yield penalty when switching from continuous flooding (CF) to alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of DSR. The yield decline varied from 6% with an irrigation threshold of 10 kPa to 26% at 70 kPa. However, there was large irrigation water saving when changing from CF to alternate wetting and drying (AWD) at only 10 kPa, and only a small rate of decline in irrigation input as the threshold increased from 10 to 70 kPa. The water saving with AWD was primarily because of less drainage. There were tradeoffs between yield, water productivity and water depletion in relation to irrigation schedule. Maximum yield occurred with CF, maximum WPI and WPI+R with an irrigation threshold of 30 kPa and maximum WPET with a threshold of 20 kPa. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1097,"Arsenic exposure of child populations in Northern Argentina Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (As) is associated with numerous adverse effects. Argentina is one of the countries affected by arsenicism; however, there are few studies that evaluate inorganic As exposure and its effects on child population. The aim of this study is to evaluate exposure to As through water and food in child populations living in the provinces of Santiago del Estero and Chaco (n = 101), and to determine the impact of this exposure analysing biomarkers of exposure (urine and hair As contents) and effect [8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)]. The populations selected live in three areas with different levels of As in the drinking water (Santa Teresa de Carballo, 0.925 mg/L; Taco Pozo, 0.210 mg/L; Jumi Pozo, 0.016 mg/L). The As intakes through water and food are especially high in the areas with the greatest As exposure (Santa Teresa de Carballo, 1575 +/- 8 mu g/day; Taco Pozo, 386 +/- 8 mu g/day; Jumi Pozo, 39 +/- 1 mu g/day). The total As contents in most of the samples of hair (0.11- 13.11 mg/kg) and urine (31- 4258 mu g/g creatinine) are higher than the reference values (hair: 1 mg/kg; urine: 50 mu g/g creatinine). The increase in the level of As exposure alters the profile of metabolites in urine, with a decrease of dimethylarsinic acid (10%) and an increase in the percentages ofmonomethylarsonic acid (4%) and inorganic As (6%). The results also showhigh values of 8- OHdG (3.7- 37.8 mu g/g creatinine), a oxidative DNA damage marker, in the two areas with greater As exposure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",1
1098,"The origin of high hydrocarbon groundwater in shallow aquifer: experimental evidences from water-rock interaction The current studies had already revealed the hydrocarbons could migrate from relatively high hydrocarbon potential stratum to shallow groundwater by corrosion emission and extraction emission in karst area and further impact on human health. Then, the comprehensive experiments were used to understand the mechanism and process of hydrocarbon emission as a continuation of a long-term study on original high hydrocarbon groundwater in shallow Triassic aquifer, taking northwest Guizhou, China, as a reference. The results determined water-rock interaction that lead to the hydrocarbon emission into groundwater with salinity acting as the main driving force. Relatively high salinity promotes the rock corrosion and hydrocarbon emission in the study area. The hydrocarbon emission process varied with different strata, as the results show that the hydrocarbon uniformly distributed in T(2)g(3) than that in T(1)yn(4). Furthermore, the stratum with uniformly distributed hydrocarbon would likely contain high hydrocarbon groundwater, as determined by the process of sedimentation. In addition, ""corrosion rate estimation method"" and ""mineral constituent estimation method"" were firstly employed to estimate the hydrocarbon concentration in groundwater to date. Compared with the hydrocarbon concentration of local groundwater samples (0 to 0.14 mg L(-1)), the result of ""mineral constituent estimation method"" was analogous to measured value of groundwater samples in the area (0.05 to 0.50 mg L(-1)), indicating the concentration of hydrocarbon could be estimated by mineral constitutions of groundwater, which was related to the concentration of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). Based on the methods and theories in this study, the concentration of original hydrocarbon in shallow groundwater could be estimated and help to understand the mechanism of water-rock interaction in shallow aquifer and original high hydrocarbon groundwater strategic assessment.",
1099,"Hierarchically structured, well-dispersed Ti4+ cross-linked chitosan as an efficient and recyclable sponge-like adsorbent for anionic azo-dye removal Porous macro-and hierarchically structured materials with desired morphologies and high adsorption capacities are of great interest because of their potential applications in realistic environmental pollutant treatment. In this study, sponge-like Ti4+ cross-linked chitosan (SL-TiCs) was synthesized using a chitosan solution and titanium metal salt as precursors. The as-prepared product was characterized via FE-SEM, HR-TEM, EDS, EMI, FT-IR and XPS. The results demonstrate that SL-TiCs is composed of multiple nano-layer twisted sheets and a high content of well-dispensed Ti4+ on its surface, which provide plenty channels for mass transfer and active sites for pollutant adsorption. The hierarchical structure of SL-TiCs exhibits a high adsorption capacity for Orange II with a fast adsorption rate and good recyclability. The adsorption performance can be described by the pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity is 1120 mg g(-1), which is much higher than that of many other adsorbents. It is speculated that the probable mechanisms involve ligand exchange (44.6%) between Cl- and dye-SO3- and electrostatic attraction (55.4%) between Ti-OH3+ and dye-SO3- anions in the adsorption process. This study implies that SL-TiCs can be a potential adsorbent for the adsorption and separation of anionic dyes from large volumes of industrial dye wastewater.",
1100,"Mitigation of arsenic in rice through deficit irrigation in field and use of filtered water in kitchen An experiment was conducted in an arsenic-affected area of West Bengal, India, with the aim of alleviating arsenic toxicity from food chain through water management in rice field and modification of cooking procedure of the same grain in kitchen. Three regimes of deficit irrigation, viz. intermittent ponding, saturation and aerobic condition were tested in field against continuous ponding, i.e. local farmers' practice. Produced grains were cooked in traditional method with both arsenic-contaminated and filtered water. Results revealed that deficit irrigation can be efficiently used to reduce the arsenic load in rice grain. Water management in field can reduce 9-21 % arsenic content in raw rice grain and can save 150-340 mm of irrigation water over traditional cultivation procedure. Furthermore, use of filtered water for cooking can alleviate up to 32 % of arsenic. The study also revealed that growing rice under deficit irrigation can also increase the water use efficiency of the crop.",
1101,"Biochemical investigation of association of arsenic exposure with risk factors of diabetes mellitus in Pakistani population and its validation in animal model Arsenic is one of the naturally occurring heavy metal that has been reported to cause damaging effects on different body organs. This study was aimed to determine the arsenic level in different water sources and investigate the effect of arsenic exposure on risk factors of diabetes mellitus (DM) in human participants and experimental animals. We recruited 150 participants to investigate the arsenic exposure in their urine and from drinking water. We found that males contained significantly higher (P < 0.001) concentrations of urinary arsenic as compared with that of their female counterparts. Similarly, urinary arsenic concentration was high and showed significant association in the age of â‰¥ 60 years (P < 0.05), illiterate (P < 0.001), smokers (P < 0.0001), and diabetic (P < 0.0001) participants. Moreover, urinary arsenic exposure was also associated with higher levels of fasting (P < 0.001) and random blood glucose (P < 0.001), HbA1c (P < 0.001), AST, ALT, MDA, IL-6, CRP, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine in arsenic-exposed diabetics as compared with that of unexposed diabetics. Further, we also exposed the white albino rats with arsenic in drinking water for 30 days and their blood glucose was measured at 15th and 30th days of treatment that was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in arsenic-exposed animals as compared with that of unexposed animals. Similarly, arsenic-exposed animals failed to tolerate exogenously administered glucose (P < 0.001) as compared with that of unexposed animals. Likewise, insulin and glutathione concentrations were also significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in arsenic-exposed animals as compared with that of unexposed animals. The alterations in normal values of glucose, insulin, and glutathione exhibited the damaging effects of arsenic exposure in experimental rats. This study showed that arsenic exposed to human beings and animals through drinking water resulted in the disruption of pancreatic Î²-cell functioning that provoked the risk factor for development of DM. This study also suggested that long-term arsenic exposure induces hyperglycemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress that may lead to the onset of development of DM.",1
1102,"Experimental simulation on mineral and hydrochemical evolution in response to water-coal-gas interaction of closed gassy coal mines One ubiquitous environmental issue with the abandoned gassy coal mine is the potential of changes in water quality due to water-rock-gas action caused by high residual gas content. Therefore, a better understanding of how to accurately characterize the new multiphase system in the closed gassy coal mine is required. The gas in closed coal mine mainly includes CH4, CO2, N-2, H2S, CO, etc., existing in the adsorbed, dissolved and free phases, which also leads to complex gas-water-rock interactions in the underground flooded pool. The recovery of the water level caused by the closure of the coal mine varied dramatically in hydrogeochemical conditions as well as gas flow performance in the flooded mine. Based on the nationwide investigation and case studies of high residual coal mine gas in abandoned coal mines in China, some sealed gassy coal mines have been experiencing the CO2 inrush problems. Modeling experiments of mine water-rock (coal)-gas(CO2/N-2) reaction were conducted in closed coal mines. The results show that with the increasing reaction time, pH value increases gradually, and the relationship between Eh and pH is negative, by taking CO2/N-2 as gas phases in the water-rock reaction. The concentration of HCO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+,and SiO2 increases with a different magnitude, and the level of total Fe decreases gradually, while the TDS of the solution increases. The reaction between typical minerals in coal and high SO42- and Fe3+ mine water is simulated. The chemical composition of mine water and coal mineral compositions are modified in order to obtain the influence of particular reactions. The results show that in the mine water-rock-gas reaction with CO2 as gas phase, the pH value of the solution increases, and the Eh decreases. The dissolution of mineral phases leads to an increasing trend in the content of HCO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and soluble SiO2 in the water. The concentration of the total Fe in the solution gradually decreases, and the mineralization of the solution gradually increases. Each mineral has individual distinct dissolution reaction rate. The dissolution of kaolinite promotes the dissolution of quartz, while calcite dissolves along with the regeneration of new carbonate minerals. Pyrite dissolves accompanied by chlorite formation. For the N-2 gas phase, changes in hydrochemistry and mineral phases are mainly controlled by water-rock interaction.",
1103,"Dynamic behavior of two-dimensional homogeneous Earth Dam models subjected to incident SH waves and synchronized input motion In many parts of the world, both industrialized and newly developing nations, the need for dam construction continues. Darns are important for water storage as well as power generation. In recent history, there have been many reports of damage to darns in major earthquakes. Several earthquakes were speculated to have been triggered by a newly placed dam and its reservoir in the area, Severe damage to a dam can be catastrophic for the cities downstream and therefore, better seismic analysis and design procedures for darns are needed. There are three common types of darns: Arch Dams, Concrete Gravity Dams, and Earth Darns. The method used to analyze concrete darns is somewhat different from that for earth dams. Because of the geometry, the steel reinforcement and the properties of concrete, the stress analysis must account for bending in addition to shear effects. With an irregular geometry, the only feasible method for analyzing concrete darns is the finite element method with element types that include bending effects. However, earth dams may not experience large bending deformations, so they can be treated as a continuous but heterogeneous medium of irregular shape. For this reason, methods commonly used in wave propagation studies but not presently used for dam analyses should be considered for possible applications. Among the many methods that can be used to solve elastodynamic problems, the most versatile are: (a) the finite elements method [1, 2]; (b) the finite difference method [3-5]; (c) the continuum mechanics methods [6]; (d) the hybrid discrete-continuum method [7, 8]. There are many methods that can be identified as continuum methods, even though most of them require numerical discretization. Their solutions are written as a linear combination of continuous wave functions of mathematical physics, and the unknown coefficients associated with the wave functions are determined from the boundary conditions. The Boundary Integral Equation Method (BIEM) is classified as a continuum method. Unlike discrete methods, the Boundary Integral Equation Method does not require discretization of the entire volume; only the interfaces between contrasting material properties are considered. Therefore, the BIEM is simpler than discrete methods when there are few interfaces. In this paper, the Boundary Integral Equation Method is used to analyze the dynamic behavior of two-dimensional antiplane models resembling earth dams and subjected to SH incident waves and synchronized input excitation. This analysis investigates primarily the physical effects caused by wave passage through the base of the dam while the hydrodynamic effects will be ignored [9]. The BIEM solution accuracy for semi-circular antiplane cross-section have been tested favorably against exact solutions. Also, the behavior of a trapezoidal cross-section will be included in this study. Numerically, the BIEM will be evaluated as a possibly useful tool for vibration problems.",
1104,"Hydrogeological investigation of ground water arsenic contamination in south Calcutta Typical clinical symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning have been detected in 1000 residents near a factory in P.N. Mitra Lane, Behala, South Calcutta, located in a thickly populated area manufacturing copper acetoarsenite (Paris-Green) an arsenical pesticide for the past 25 years. Soil around the effluent dumping point of the factory was exceptionally contaminated, with arsenic, copper and chromium concentrations of 20,100-35,500 mg kg-1, 33,900-51,100 mg kg-1 and 5300-5510 mg kg-1. Arsenic and copper concentrations in bore-hole soils collected up to a depth of 24.4 m at the effluent dumping point, decreased with depth. Arsenous acid, arsenic acid, methylarsonic acid (MA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were detected in bore-hole soils up to a depth of 1.37 m, after which only inorganic arsenical compounds were present. A positive correlation was established between arsenic and copper authenticated the Paris-Green waste disposal site as the source of contamination. Mechanism of ground water contamination from this disposal site had been probed by a systematic hydrogeological survey and the arsenic content of the tube-well waters in the surrounding areas. Hydraulic conductivity was maximum in the central part. The site for disposal of the effluent was a ditch located in the zone of discharge. Sparingly soluble Paris-Green cumulatively deposited in the waste disposal site is decomposed by micro-organisms to water-soluble forms and finally percolated to underground aquifers along with rain water through the discharge zone. The contaminant is currently moving towards WNW with ground water flow and the residents in the direction of encroaching contamination are insecure due to penetration of the contaminant.",1

1106,"Use the predictive models to explore the key factors affecting phytoplankton succession in Lake Erhai, China Increasing algae in Lake Erhai has resulted in frequent blooms that have not only led to water ecosystem degeneration but also seriously influenced the quality of the water supply and caused extensive damage to the local people, as the lake is a water resource for Dali City. Exploring the key factors affecting phytoplankton succession and developing predictive models with easily detectable parameters for phytoplankton have been proven to be practical ways to improve water quality. To this end, a systematic survey focused on phytoplankton succession was conducted over 2 years in Lake Erhai. The data from the first study year were used to develop predictive models, and the data from the second year were used for model verification. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton in Lake Erhai was obvious. The dominant groups were Cyanobacteria in the summer, Chlorophyta in the autumn and Bacillariophyta in the winter. The developments and verification of predictive models indicated that compared to phytoplankton biomass, phytoplankton density is more effective for estimating phytoplankton variation in Lake Erhai. CCA (canonical correlation analysis) indicated that TN (total nitrogen), TP (total phosphorus), DO (dissolved oxygen), SD (Secchi depth), Cond (conductivity), T (water temperature), and ORP (oxidation reduction potential) had significant influences (p < 0.05) on the phytoplankton community. The CCA of the dominant species found that Microcystis was significantly influenced by T. The dominant Chlorophyta, Psephonema aenigmaticum and Mougeotia, were significantly influenced by TN. All results indicated that TN and T were the two key factors driving phytoplankton succession in Lake Erhai.",

Solar energy accounts for less than 1% of the total energy produced in India[1]. While photovoltaic power plants continue to dominate in India, the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) market has yet to build, operate and maintain its first large scale solar thermal power plant in India. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) was introduced in 2010. The aim of this mission is to create an enabling policy framework for the deployment of 20,000 MW of solar power by the year 2022[2]. In the first phase of the national solar mission, out of the 620 MW allocated by the federal government, 470 MW was allocated to solar thermal power and 150 MW to solar photovoltaic power [3]. The majority of these projects are located in the desert state of Rajasthan, the sunniest region in the country. In 2010, IIT Bombay, a premier education institution in Mumbai, decided to create a test facility which would help in gaining experience in design, operation and maintenance of large scale solar thermal power plants. This facility would also help in facilitating research development in the solar industry in India. This project was named 'National Solar Thermal Power Testing, Simulation and Research Facility'. The objective of the project was to install an expected combined capacity of 5 MWth, supply it to the national grid and also to act as a facility for component testing [4]. The 5 MWth power was divided into two power plants of different technologies: Parabolic trough and linear Fresnel reflector technology. The 3MW(th) parabolic trough solar field was built by Abengoa. Abengoa (MCE: ABG.B) applies innovative technology solutions for sustainability in the energy and environment sectors, generating electricity from renewable resources, converting biomass into biofuels and producing drinking water from sea water. (www.abengoa.com). The 3 MWth solar thermal parabolic trough field built by Abengoa, is the first parabolic trough power plant in India. The heat transfer fluid used is Therminol VP-1 which has an operating range of 12 - 400 degrees Celsius. The control system of the solar field is based on a hierarchical architecture of three levels. The plant is equipped with controllers to track the position of the sun on real time basis and optimize the energy absorption. The plant does not release any carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The parabolic trough solar collector field has been supplied by Abengoa, and the power block and the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) system have been supplied by IIT Bombay. The solar field consists of three loops with parabolic troughs of a total of about 1,500 meters in length and covering an area of 8,000 square meters. The solar field configuration of three loops of four collectors includes 12 steel structures of 10 modules, 3,360 solar reflectors, 360 receivers and 12 tracking devices. Other parts of the system include the HTF storage vessel with pumps, the in-line electrical heater and the expansion vessel. The project has not only shown India's capability to build large scale solar thermal power plants, but it also has exposed key challenges facing the CSP industry, like the limited CSP experience in India and the huge capital cost premium. This project with its sets of vagaries and triumphs has been a maiden attempt to pave the way for understanding and institutionalising the CSP market in India. (C) 2013 The Authors.

1108,"Adsorption of As(III) from aqueous solutions by iron oxide-coated sand Arsenic is a toxic element and may be found in natural waters as well as in industrial waters. Leaching of arsenic from industrial wastewater into groundwater may cause significant contamination, which requires proper treatment before its use as drinking water. The present study describes removal of arsenic(III) on iron oxide-coated sand in batch studies conducted as a function of pH, time, initial arsenic concentration, and adsorbent dosage. The results were compared with those for uncoated sand. The adsorption data fitted well in the Langmuir model at different initial concentration of As(III) at 20 g/l fixed adsorbent dose. Maximum adsorption of As(II) for coated sand is found to be much higher (28.57 mu g/g) than that for uncoated sand (5.63 mu g/g) at pH 7.5 in 2 h. The maximum As(III) removal efficiency achieved is 99% for coated sand at an adsorbent dose of 20 g/l with initial As(III) concentration of 100 mu g/l in batch studies. Column studies have also been carried out with 400 mu g/l arsenic (pH 7.5) by varying the contact time, filtration rate, and bed depth. Results of column studies demonstrated that at a filtration rate of 4 ml/min the maximum removal of As(III) observed was 94% for coated sand in a contact time of 2 h. The results observed in batch and column studies indicate that iron oxide-coated sand is a suitable adsorbent for reducing As(III) concentration to the limit (50 mu g/l) recommended by Indian Standards for Drinking Water.

1109,"Monitoring estrogen and androgen residues from livestock farms in Phayao Lake, Thailand The aim of the present study was to investigate steroid hormone residues from livestock farms and assess their risks to the surface water of Phayao Lake. These steroid hormones are endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), which can be found in natural and synthetic forms. This research focused on examining the residues of seven steroid hormones (five estrogens and two androgens-estrone (E1), 17Î±-estradiol (Î±E2), 17Î²-estradiol (Î²E2), estriol (E3), 17Î±-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), testosterone (T), and 17Î±-methyltestosterone (MT)) from four types of livestock farms around Phayao Lake, Thailand. The samples collected from the livestock farms included feces, soil, and wastewater and were extracted by the solid phase extraction (SPE) technique and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The risks from the residual steroid hormones were also characterized by estradiol equivalents (EEQs), testosterone equivalents (TEQs), and risk quotients (RQs). The results indicated that most hormone contamination from the farms' livestock was due to the estrogen hormones E1 (1.38-97.10Â ng/g), Î²E2 (10.08-1366Â ng/g), and EE2 (1.50-99.92Â ng/g), which originate from the natural excretion and admixture of steroids in feedstock or medicines. Steroid hormones were not detected in the wastewater from cleaning processes on farms with wastewater treatment plants, whereas farms without wastewater treatment plants showed high values of estrogen hormone contamination, with EEQs of 128.8-472.9Â ng/L and RQs of 208.3-294.3. However, the analysis of steroid hormone residues in Phayao Lake demonstrated that the residues did not severely affect aquatic organisms (with RQs of 0.002-144.5), and no estrogen or androgen residues were observed in the water treatment plant or tap water.",
1110,"Intraspecific variations in cadmium tolerance and phytoaccumulation in giant duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) Duckweeds are widely recognized for the heavy metal phytoremediation. However, the intraspecific variations in biological responses of duckweeds to heavy metal remain largely unknown. Here, the toxicity and phytoaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) were synchronously evaluated in 30 accessions of giant duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) collected from different provenances in Southern China. Exposure to 1 mu M Cd decreased relative growth rates of dry weight, fronds number and fronds area, as well as photosynthetic pigment contents, while it increased H2O2 accumulation, lipid peroxidation and activities of anti-oxidant enzymes in the majority of accessions. Cd treatment led to remarkable Cd accumulation but little changes in the starch content in giant duckweed. The biological responses to Cd varied among the accessions. Further correlation analysis indicated that growth traits and Cd concentration were positively correlated with Cd accumulation, while the contents of chlorophyll, H2O2 and MDA were negatively associated with Cd accumulation. Our results proved the great intraspecific variation in Cd tolerance of giant duckweed, suggesting a valuable natural resource for Cd phytoremediation. Moreover, different mechanisms may be exploited by S. polyrhiza for phytoaccumulation, but growth maintenance, Cd uptake and antioxidative enzyme-independent ROS-scavenging under Cd exposure are the common mechanisms contributing to Cd accumulation ability.",1
1111,"Deep geothermal for district heating and spa resorts in Romania and Bulgaria Romania and Bulgaria have rich resources of deep geothermal on a temperature level that is suitable for direct use in district heating (DH). Otopeni is a city located north and nearby to Bucharest with a population of 11000 inhabitants. DH was originally provided from seven boiler houses and rich geothermal resources servicing almost 2000 apartments until the year 1992. The hot water supplies were stopped in 1987 because the steel system corroded rapidly due to the geothermal water. After analyzing several scenarios automatization of boiler plants, interconnection between main boiler plants to enable central supply and installation of sanitary hot water modules were suggested. Due to the increased speed of installation the reduction of fuel usage for heavy machinery, polyfusion head to head welding, reduction of manpower, and elimination of consumables unnecessary in the welding of PB pipes has been reduced to 25%. Similarly, the Sapareva Banja in Bulgaria used flexible polybutene-1 pipes that were slipped into the old steel pipes. The experiences during the installation were the minimum disturbance and the speed of the installation due to pipe in coils, saving 70% of the connections.",
1112,"Robust electrochemical analysis of As(III) integrating with interference tests: a case study in groundwater In Togtoh region of Inner Mongolia, northern China, groundwater encountered high concentrations As contamination (greater than 50 Î¼g L(-1)) causes an increasing concern. This work demonstrates an electrochemical protocol for robust (efficient and accurate) determination of As(III) in Togtoh water samples using Au microwire electrode without the need of pretreatment or clean-up steps. Considering the complicated conditions of Togtoh water, the efficiency of Au microwire electrode was systematically evaluated by a series of interference tests, stability and reproducibility measurements. No obvious interference on the determination of As(III) was observed. Especially, the influence of humic acid (HA) was intensively investigated. Electrode stability was also observed with long-term measurements (70 days) in Togtoh water solution and under different temperatures (0-35 Â°C). Excellent reproducibility (RSD:1.28%) was observed from different batches of Au microwire electrodes. The results obtained at Au microwire electrode were comparable to that obtained by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), indicating a good accuracy. These evaluations (efficiency, robustness, and accuracy) demonstrated that the Au microwire electrode was able to determine As(III) in application to real environmental samples.",1
1113,"Hydrocarbon water-pollution related to chronic kidney disease in Tierra Blanca, a perfect storm Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects the kidneys, and in severe cases is considered as end-stage renal disease which can only be treated by dialysis and transplantation. Tierra Blanca city has a higher CKD rate compared to other Mexican cities, but its principal cause has not been found yet. Main factors related to CKD are carbonated beverage consumption, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heat stress, dehydration, and intoxication by pesticides, heavy metals, and/or hydrocarbons. The aim of this work was to evaluate hydrocarbon pollution in Tierra Blanca domestic fresh-water related to CKD and to integrate this information with other main factors in order to suggest precautionary actions taking account of key actors. We found hydrocarbons in the water wells of the city and the presence of other risk factors, which creates a perfect storm for CKD. Additionally, key actors were identified in order to follow precautionary principles related to CKD cases in Tierra Blanca.",
1114,"Mass loading, distribution, and removal of antibiotics and antiretroviral drugs in selected wastewater treatment plants in Kenya The discharge of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the aquatic environment from wastewater effluents is a concern in many countries. Although many studies have been conducted to evaluate the APIs removal efficiencies and emissions to the environment in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), most of these studies considered the aqueous and sludge phases, disregarding the suspended particulate matter (SPM) phase. To try to understand the role of the SPM, the occurrence of five most common antibiotics and three antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) commonly used in Kenya were investigated in this study. APIs partitioning and mass loading in influents and effluents of three different WWTPs: trickling filters, stabilization ponds, and decentralized fecal sludge system, were evaluated. API concentration levels ranging from Ë‚LOQ (limit of quantification) to 92 Î¼gL(-1) and Ë‚LOQ to 82.2 mgkg(-1) were observed in aqueous samples and solid samples respectively, with SPM accounting for most of the higher concentrations. The use of the aqueous phase alone for determination of removal efficiencies showed underestimations of API removal as compared to when solid phases are also considered. Negative removal efficiencies were observed, depending on the compound and the type of WWTP. The negative removals were associated with deconjugation of metabolites, aggregated accumulation of APIs in the WWTPs, as well as unaccounted hydraulic retention time during sampling. Compound characteristics, environmental factors, and WWTPs operation influenced WWTPs removal efficiencies. Wastewater stabilization ponds had the poorest removals efficiencies with an average of -322%. High total mass loads into the WWTPs influent and effluent of 22,729 and 22,385Â mgÂ day(-1) 1000 PE(-1) were observed respectively. The results aims at aiding scientists and engineers in planning and designing of WWTPs. Findings also aim at aiding policy-making on pharmaceutical drug use and recommend proper wastewater management practices to manage the high mass loading observed in the WWTPs.",
1115,"Explosive energy distribution in an explosive column through use of non-explosive material-case studies The entire process of explosive selection and utilization is solely dependent on 'explosive energy utilization' in any blasting operation. Extensive studies in the field and laboratories across the globe had indicated, the effectively explosive energy is used, the better is the blasting result and safer the same. Last few decades had come out with several specific solutions to effectively use the explosive energy by means of stemming column stabilization, incorporating air-deck etc in the explosive column etc. All these studies have been undertaken in laboratory as well as mass production scale. When it comes to inserting or placing non-explosive material for explosive energy distribution, numerous systems like chemically activated gas bags, wooden block spacers, inflated rubber balls etc. have been experimented and used. In view of the rising cost of explosives and accessories in any mines, the mine operators were not forthcoming to use these non-explosive materials, owing to higher cost component involved. The authors have thus tried a number of materials to replace gas bags etc, on both economic and technical view points. Used plastic water bottles of one liter capacity, was chosen to strengthen the stemming column, to insert an air-pocket in the explosive column and also in the sub-grade region of any blast hole. An attempt has been made to present the various aspects of the explosive energy distribution, and experiments conducted with the use of plastic bottles in Uranium, Limestone, Iron Ore and other surface mine blasting in India.",
1116,"EFFECTS OF VARYING INLET IRON AND MANGANESE CONCENTRATIONS ON SLOW SAND FILTER PERFORMANCE In this study a laboratory-scale slow sand filter (SSF) is used for removal of iron and manganese and the effects of various inlet concentrations on removal efficiency were investigated. SSF was operated at a filtration rate of 0.2 m.h(-1) with two different synthetic inlet waters (Run1 and Run2). Iron and manganese concentrations in two runs were 1.09 +/- 0.13mg. L-1-1.06 +/- 0.10 mg.L-1 for Run1 and 2.02 +/- 0.15 mg.L-1-2.10 +/- 0.14 mg.L-1 for Run2. In Run1, the removal efficiencies of 96.3 +/- 2.48%, 92.3 +/- 6.1%, 92.6 +/- 5.7%, and 55.3 +/- 8.3% were obtained for turbidity, iron, manganese and total organic carbon (TOC), respectively. In Run2, on the other hand, the removal efficiencies were obtained as 97.9 +/- 1.3%, 93.1 +/- 8.1%, 94.4 +/- 5.8%, and 55.5 +/- 6.8%, respectively. Results suggested that the SSF was the most efficient in turbidity removal at a filtration rate of 0.2 m.h(-1). Sequence analyses of DGGE bands from Run1 and Run2 were also performed and results indicated that a range of bacteria were present, with 16S rRNA gene sequences similar to groups such as Gallionella, Leptothrix, Crenothrix, and an uncharacterized environmental clone.",
1117,"The Trace Metal Chemistry of Deep Geothermal Water, Palinpinon Geothermal Field, Negros Island, Philippines: Implications for Precious Metal Deposition in Epithermal Gold Deposits Palinpinon geothermal field, Negros Island, Philippines, is a high-temperature, liquid-dominated geothermal system in an active volcanic island-arc setting. Parallels have been drawn between the geologic setting and hydrothermal alteration styles recognized at Palinpinon with those that characterize several types of magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits (e.g., porphyry, skim, and high and intermediate sulfidation epithermal systems). The neutral chloride Palinpinon reservoir water chemistry is affected by boiling, mixing, and conductive cooling. The occurrence of base and precious metal scale deposits in several geothermal wells demonstrates that the deep reservoir fluid is capable of transporting and depositing base and precious metals. However, trace metal analysis of the deep reservoir fluids shows they are undersaturated with respect to gold (1-4 mu g/kg). Chemical modeling of Palinpinon geothermal water predicts that boiling should lie the most effective mechanism for base and precious metal deposition, producing sulfide assemblages similar to those present in well scale deposits. Mixing with acid-bearing sulfate waters can also produce these sulfide assemblages, but less efficiently and with gold and silver deposition occurring at lower temperatures (i.e., <110 degrees C). Despite indications that modern hydrothermal fluids are capable of metal transportation, base and precious metal deposition is not strongly developed at Palinpinon. Base and precious metal concentrations in drill core and drill cuttings are one to two orders of magnitude below ore grade (<0.02 wt % Cu, <0.03 wt % Pb, <0.01 wt % Zn, <0.01 wt % Mo, <8 g/t Ag, and <0.05 g/t Au), and important features that characterize high-grade ore zones of porphyry (i.e., quartz stock-work veining) and epithermal deposits (i.e., residual vuggy quartz, massive crustiform veins, and/or hydrothermal breccia complexes) are apparently absent at Palinpinon. Such features intimate that high-grade ore deposition is promoted by large volumes of fluid and highly permeable wall rock. Their absence at Palinpinon indicates that permeability, fluid flux, and/or metal transport have been insufficient to form significant zones of base or precious metal enrichment.",1
1118,"[Spatial and temporal variability of nitrate contaminant in groundwater in Jinfo Mt. area, Chongqing, China] The geochemical background of nitrate in groundwater in Jinfo Mt. area was determined, and spatial and temporal variability of nitrate contaminant was analyzed using geochemical, statistical and GIS methods. Twenty-three samples were collected from groundwater discharge points in the study area during 1976-1977, 2004-2006 and 2009, and mass concentration of nitrate in groundwater was tested. The results showed that the geochemical background of nitrate in groundwater in study area was in the range of 0.72-2. 00 mg x L(-1), and the threshold of anomaly was 3.20 mg x L(-1). During 2004-2006 and 2009, the average values of nitrate concentration in groundwater in Jinfo Mt. natural reserve were 2.08, 2.67, 2.59 and 3.92 mg x L(-1); and were 39.08, 25.46, 17.99 and 13.73 mg x L(-1) in the groundwater out of the reserve; the average over-limit rates (standard limit NO3(-) -N < or = 10mg x L(-1)) were 451.64%, 478.61%, 331.85% and 145.67%; the maximum over-limit rates were 1 475.81%, 1 080.39%, 538.20% and 361.78%. Results of interpolation showed that the high value centers of nitrate concentration in groundwater in study area were changing over time, but districts with low nitrate concentration in groundwater in study area were distributed along Jinfo Mt. natural reserve. The application of environmental policy measures and industrial restructuring implemented were reasonable and successful, which had a positive effect to environmental protection.",
1119,"Evaluation and Comparison of Satellite-Derived Estimates of Rainfall in the Diverse Climate and Terrain of Central and Northeastern Ethiopia Understanding rainfall processes as the main driver of the hydrological cycle is important for formulating future water management strategies; however, rainfall data availability is challenging for countries such as Ethiopia. This study aims to evaluate and compare the satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM 3B43v7), rainfall estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks-climate data record (PERSIANN-CDR), merged satellite-gauge rainfall estimate (IMERG), and the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) with ground-observed data over the varied terrain of hydrologically diverse central and northeastern parts of Ethiopia-Awash River Basin (ARB). Areal comparisons were made between SREs and observed rainfall using various categorical indices and statistical evaluation criteria, and a non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was analyzed. The monthly weighted observed rainfall exhibited relatively comparable results with SREs, except for the annual peak rainfall shifts noted in all SREs. The PERSIANN-CDR products showed a decreasing trend in rainfall at elevations greater than 2250 m above sea level in a river basin. This demonstrates that elevation and rainfall regimes may affect satellite rainfall data. On the basis of modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency, the SREs from IMERG v06, TRMM 3B43v7, and PERSIANN-CDR performed well in descending order over the ARB. However, GSMaP showed poor performance except in the upland sub-basin. A high frequency of bias, which led to an overestimation of SREs, was exhibited in TRMM 3B43v7 and PERSIANN-CDR products in the eastern and lower basins. Furthermore, the MK test results of SREs showed that none of the sub-basins exhibited a monotonic trend at 5% significance level except the GSMap rainfall in the upland sub-basin. In ARB, except for the GSMaP, all SREs can be used as alternative options for rainfall frequency-, flood-, and drought-monitoring studies. However, some may require bias corrections to improve the data quality.",
1120,"A missense variant in FTCD is associated with arsenic metabolism and toxicity phenotypes in Bangladesh Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a carcinogen, and exposure to iAs via food and water is a global public health problem. iAs-contaminated drinking water alone affects >100 million people worldwide, including ~50 million in Bangladesh. Once absorbed into the blood stream, most iAs is converted to mono-methylated (MMA) and then di-methylated (DMA) forms, facilitating excretion in urine. Arsenic metabolism efficiency varies among individuals, in part due to genetic variation near AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32). To identify additional arsenic metabolism loci, we measured protein-coding variants across the human exome for 1,660 Bangladeshi individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Among the 19,992 coding variants analyzed exome-wide, the minor allele (A) of rs61735836 (p.Val101Met) in exon 3 of FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) was associated with increased urinary iAs% (P = 8x10-13), increased MMA% (P = 2x10-16) and decreased DMA% (P = 6x10-23). Among 2,401 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions (an indicator of arsenic toxicity and cancer risk) and 2,472 controls, carrying the low-efficiency A allele (frequency = 7%) was associated with increased skin lesion risk (odds ratio = 1.35; P = 1x10-5). rs61735836 is in weak linkage disequilibrium with all nearby variants. The high-efficiency/major allele (G/Valine) is human-specific and eliminates a start codon at the first 5Â´-proximal Kozak sequence in FTCD, suggesting selection against an alternative translation start site. FTCD is critical for catabolism of histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In our study population, FTCD and AS3MT SNPs together explain ~10% of the variation in DMA% and support a causal effect of arsenic metabolism efficiency on arsenic toxicity (i.e., skin lesions). In summary, this work identifies a coding variant in FTCD associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency, providing new evidence supporting the established link between one-carbon/folate metabolism and arsenic toxicity.",1
1121,"HEAVY METALS CONCENTRATION IN RIVER AND PUMPING WELL WATER FOR RIVER BANK FILTRATION (RBF) SYSTEM: CASE STUDY IN SUNGAI KERIAN Riverbank filtration (RBF) provides an alternative to extract raw water by removing pollutants such as suspended solids, organic carbon, and pathogenic bacteria/microbes in the water. However, the main issue with this system is the occurrence of high concentrations of arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) in the production well. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the presence of heavy metals in river water and pumping well water for an RBF system. Water samples were collected from Sungai Kerian (Kerian River) and a pumping well during a three-day pumping test. The heavy metal concentration in both samples was analyzed for 21 elements using ICP-OES. A total of 12 elements were detected in the water samples from either the river or the pumping well. Among the detected elements, As and Fe had concentrations that exceeded the standard values set by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. Results also suggested that the Fe concentration in the pumping well water was higher than that in the river water. Conversely, As was more frequently detected in the river water than in the pumping well water. These results imply that the As concentration in the river water was derived from external sources, while the presence of As and Fe in the pumping well water was influenced by geochemical and hydrochemical processes in the aquifer.",1
1122,"An Exploration Model for A Gold Deposit in Kervian Area, Kurdistan Province, Iran, using a Combination of Geophysical Results with Geological Information and Other Exploratory Data As many gold deposits are associated with sulfide zones, and the direct exploration of gold deposits using the geophysical methods is very difficult due to its low amount in the sub-surface, the direct exploration of sulfide zones by the geophysical electrical resistivity and induced polarization (IP) methods may lead to the indirect exploration of gold deposits. The gold deposit in the Kervian area is located in the Kurdistan shear zone, and is directly related to the sulfide, silica, and carbonate alteration units. After acquiring the resistivity and IP data, 2D modeling of the data is made in order to indirectly identify the gold-bearing zones in the surveyed area. As some of the identified geophysical anomalies indicating the sulfide zones may not be associated with the economic amounts of gold, in order to obtain an exploration pattern for the gold deposit in the studied area, a combination of the geophysical data modeling and interpretation results with the geological information and other exploratory data is used to reduce the uncertainty in identifying the gold-bearing zones in the studied area. Thus, modeling and interpretation of the geophysical data lead to identify the subsurface anomalies as the locations of possible gold mineralization in the area, and then the drilling points are suggested in the area. Considering the geological studies and chemical analysis of the samples taken from the drilled boreholes crossing some of the geophysical anomalies, we conclude that the geophysical anomalies occurring inside the phyllite and carbonate units in the area can contain an economic amount of gold, and thus are recommended as the top priority for further exploration.",
1123,"Assessment of Degree of Association Between Markers of Oxidative Stress in Lead Poisoned Mice Lead (Pb) is an abundant and one of the most lethal metals found in the earth's crust. Its use by humans dates back to thousands of year. Even the low doses of lead are responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species which leads to oxidative load. This oxidative stress mitigates production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and down regulates antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Study Design: Quasi experimental Study. Place and duration of study: Department of Biochemistry, ANMCH, Islamabad, Pakistan in collaboration with NIH, Islamabad from November, 2018 to April, 2019. Methodology: A total of 40 BALB/c mice were divided into two groups of 20 mice each. Group. was given normal standard diet. Group.. was given lead acetate in drinking water with normal diet without any supplementation. Levels of malondialdehyde were measured by using Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) was estimated by xanthine oxidase method at the end of study. Results: The results of our study showed increase in MDA and decrease in SOD in lead treated group when compared with the control group. Pearson correlation was applied to assess the degree of association between two parameters, it showed significant negative correlation with value of r = -0.96 and p-value of 0.001 Conclusion: It was concluded from our study that increase in MDA leads to decrease in SOD indicating strong negative correlation in lead poisoned mice.",
1124,"Evolution of oceanographic conditions off Baja California: 1997-1999 This paper examines the oceanic response off Baja California, Mexico, to the 1997-1998 El Nino and the transition to La Nina conditions. The data presented were gathered during seven cruises over a grid based on the CaICOFI station plan, from lines 100-130, out to station 80. T-S diagrams with data obtained during the peak phase of El Nino, demonstrate that warmer and saltier (spicier) than normal conditions prevailed in the upper 600 m over this region. Temperature and salinity anomalies calculated for CalCOFI line 120 revealed waters near the coast at 50 m depth to be up to 8.7 degreesC warmer and S = 0.8 saltier than the climatology during October 1997. These large anomalies persisted through January 1998, with some slight diminution in the magnitudes near the surface. This study suggests that anomalously warm and salty waters were fed from a source of spicy water to the southwest, identified as Subtropical Surface Water (StSW), and that low-salinity Tropical surface waters (TSW) were blocked to the southeast in the vicinity of the tip of the Peninsula. Subsurface waters associated with the California undercurrent (CU), fed from the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), were also warmer and saltier than normal, and indicate a significant expansion in volume of the CU, presumably a result of intensification of poleward flow at depth. We postulate that the well defined near-surface and deep poleward flows in the study area reflect anomalous large-scale cyclonic circulation affecting the flow in the southeastern region of the North Pacific subtropical gyre east of 125degreesW. Following the El Nino event, warm and salty upper waters retreated to latitudes south of Punta Eugenia. With the return to normal and cooler conditions, equatorward flow over the sampling grid predominated with an increased meandering and mesoscale activity. Transition to La Nina conditions would have been associated with re-establishment of normal anticyclonic flow in the southeastern quadrant of the Pacific subtropical gyre.

1125,"THE OLDEST CHINESE LOANWORDS IN THE TOCHARIAN LANGUAGES Tocharian tribes of Indo-European origin settled along the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (now @62 Xinjiang, China) around 2000 BC. Living on the ancient trade route leading from China to Europe, they controlled an important section of the Silk Road, miming along the Taklamakan Desert M for about three millennia. The Tocharians were the first Indo-Europeans who came into contact with a Sino-Tibetan population, in particular with Chinese tribes. The author analyses the oldest Chinese borrowings which entered the two Tocharian languages in the Old Chinese period (1000-200 BC), as well as in the epoch of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) and in the Early Middle Chinese period (ca. 600 AD). The Tocharians adopted various achievements of Old Chinese civilization, e.g. the terms for 'rice' (Toch. AB klu OCh. fr1), `brandy' (Toch. <- VA), damp' (Toch. AB cok <- EMCh. A), 'pot' (Toch. B lwake OCh. ph1), or 'abacus' (Toch. B;sip:Mk/tic <- EMCh. @@1,'J). They also took over Chinese names of measures and units that proved useful in trade, e.g. Toch. B cak 'hundred quarts' ( OCh. E), Toch. B cane* 'cash' (<- OCh. Toch. B tau 'ten quarts' (<- EMCh. Toch. B sank 'a measure of volume' (<- EMCh. ft). The term for a larger settlement (Toch. A ri, B rive `town, city' <- OCh. 'village, community') was also borrowed in the Old Chinese era, as was the name of the last month of the year (Toch. B *rap < OCh. it). In the early phase of the Middle Chinese period, Tocharian tribes also borrowed the Chinese name of a beautifully-colored exotic bird (Toch. A ythmasi, BA/mats/ 'a kind of waterfowl' <- EMCh. 'parrot').",

The morphology and surface chemical compositions of the prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. The regenerated AC-ZnO composites exhibited a well-developed porous structure with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area in excess of 1,100 m(2)/g, and the ZnO nanoparticles decomposed from zinc acetate loaded on the surface of the regenerated AC without aggregation. The adsorption performance of the AC-ZnO composites was further evaluated by adsorbing Congo Red (CR) from aqueous solutions. The experimental isotherms data were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models. Langmuir and Temkin models were found to satisfactorily match the experimental data with the maximum CR adsorption capacity of 16.72 mg/g for the sample activated by CO2 at 308 K. Similarly, the kinetics of adsorption were tested with pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models, and the data were found to conform to the pseudo-second-order kinetics with high correlation coefficient. The intraparticle diffusion model indicated external film diffusion, and intraparticle diffusion has taken place during the adsorption process.",
1127,"Astronomically tuned Plio-Pleistocene benthic delta O-18 record from South China Sea and Atlantic-Pacific comparison Based on benthic foraminiferal delta(18)O from ODP Site 1143, a 5-Myr astronomical timescale for the West Pacific Plio-Pleistocene was established using an automatic orbital tuning method. The tuned Brunhes/Matuyama paleomagnetic polarity reversal age agrees well with the previously published age of 0.78 Ma. The tuned ages for several planktonic foraminifer bio-events also agree well with published dates, and new ages for some other bio-events in the South China Sea were also estimated. The benthic 5110 from Site 1143 is highly coherent with the Earth's orbit (ETP) both at the obliquity and precession bands for the last 5 Myr, and at the eccentricity band for the last 2 Myr. In general, the 41-kyr cycle was dominant through the Plio-Pleistocene although the 23-kyr cycle was also very strong. The 100-kyr cycle became dominant only during the last I Myr. A comparison of the benthic delta(18)O between the Atlantic (ODP 659) and the East and West Pacific (846 and 1143) reveals that the Atlantic-Pacific benthic oxygen isotope difference ratio (Deltadelta(18)O(Atl-Pac)) displays an increasing trend in three time intervals: 3.6-2.7 Ma, 2.7-2.1 Ma and 1.5-0.25 Ma. Each of the intervals begins with a rapid negative shift in Deltadelta(18)O(Atl-Pac), followed by a long period with an increasing trend, corresponding to the growth of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet. This means that all three intervals of ice sheet growth in the Northern Hemisphere were accompanied at the beginning by a rapid relative warming of deep water in the Atlantic as compared to that of the Pacific, followed by its gradual relative cooling. This general trend, superimposed on the frequent fluctuations with glacial cycles, should yield insights into the processes leading to the boreal glaciation. Cross-spectral analyses of the Deltadelta(18)O(Atl-Pac) with the Earth's orbit suggests that after the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at about 2.5 Ma, obliquity rather than precession had become the dominant force controlling the vertical structure or thermohaline circulation in the paleo-ocean.

1128,"Warning! Fluoride debate ahead The fluoridation of South Africa's piped water supplies is set to continue despite increasing concerns over its potential implications on health and the environment. While the international debate has raged for more than 50 years, the South African wrangle started in 2000 when the Department of Health (DOH) published its fluoridation regulations in the Government Gazette. This legislation obligates the country's water service providers to fluoride water to a concentration of up to 0.7 mg/e. However, the regulations have come under severe fire from politicians and water professionals alike. Earlier this year, the majority of the members of the public who gathered at Johannesburg Water objected to fluoridation of their water supplies. At a recent meeting of Parliament's Water Affairs Portfolio Committee, the plans to fluoridate South Africa's water encountered adverse reaction from committee members, including chair Buyelwa Sonjica of the ANC, who said that there was no clear evidence that the country should go ahead with the implementation of the regulations. The majority of the committee members agreed that there was not enough conclusive research done on the issue (particularly in the South African context) that would lead the committee to believe that the fluoridation of water was or was not in the best interest of South Africans. Meanwhile, water professionals across the country have expressed their discontent with the regulations.",
1129,"Non-Darcian flow to a well in a leaky aquifer using the Forchheimer equation Non-Darcian flow to a well in a leaky aquifer was investigated using a finite difference method. Flow in the leaky aquifer is assumed to be non-Darcian and horizontal, while flow in the aquitard is assumed to be Darcian and vertical. The Forchheimer equation was employed to describe the non-Darcian flow in the aquifer. The finite difference solution was compared with the solution of Birpinar and Sen (2004). The latter overestimates the drawdown at early times and underestimates the drawdown at late times; also, the impact of beta (D) on the drawdown depends on the value of B (D), where beta (D) is a dimensionless turbulent factor in the Forchheimer equation and B (D) is the dimensionless leakage parameter. The impact of leakage on drawdown is similar to that of Darcian flow. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the drawdown is very sensitive to the change in the dimensionless well radius r (cD) when B (D) is relatively large, while it is sensitive to the change in B (D) when B (D) is relatively small. The numerical solution has been applied to analyze the pumping test data in Chaj-Doab area of Pakistan. Birpinar ME, Sen Z (2004) Forchheimer groundwater flow law type curves for leaky aquifers.

1130,"Evaluating the genesis and dominant processes of groundwater salinization by using hydrochemistry and multiple isotopes in a mining city The increasing salinization of groundwater renders it challenging to maintain the water quality. Moreover, knowledge regarding the characteristics and mechanism of groundwater salinization in mining areas remains limited. This study represents the first attempt of combining the hydrochemical, isotope (Î´D, Î´(18)O, Î´(37)Cl, and (87)Sr/(86)Sr) and multivariate statistical analysis methods to explore the origin, control, and influence of fluoride enrichment in mining cities. The TDS content of groundwater ranged from 275.9Â mg/L to 2452.0Â mg/L, and 54% of the groundwater samples were classified as class IV water according to China's groundwater quality standards (GB/T 14848-2017), indicating a decline in the water quality of the study area. The results of the groundwater ion ratio and isotope discrimination analysis showed that dissolution and evaporation involving water-rock interactions and halite were the main driving processes for groundwater salinization in the study area. In addition to the hydrogeological and climatic conditions, mine drainage inputs exacerbated the increasing salinity of the groundwater in local areas. The mineral dissolution, cation exchange, and evaporation promoted the F(-) enrichment, while excessive evaporation and salinity inhibited the F(-) enrichment. Gangue accumulation and infiltration likely led to considerable F(-) enrichment in individual groundwater regions. Extensive changes in the groundwater salinity indicated differences in the geochemical processes that controlled the groundwater salinization. Given the particularity of the study area, the enrichment of salinization and fluoride triggered by mining activities cannot be ignored.",
1131,"Performance index modeling for urban water system using hierarchical fuzzy inference approach In developing country like India, water management is growing exploding and all these water resources should maintain in the developing countries. There are many failures in the urban water system occur because of lack of assessment of present and future conditions. This needs a performance assessment method to assess performance and inform any irregularity for better performance of the urban water system. In this paper, we find performance index value through an integrated hierarchical fuzzy inference approach for urban water system. There are eight important parameters used as input for the proposed integrated hierarchical fuzzy inference model. This integrated modeling minimizes the different conditions in the rule base. For a very large set, reduction in rule is significant because of simplicity and interpretation. Additional, it is very important to design many rules because that requires skilled expertise; otherwise, it will lead to unexpected incidents. As compared to traditional fuzzy inference with integrated hierarchical fuzzy inference, a design that needs only fewer rules. For the proposed model, we take only 165 rules and for the similar eight variables, the traditional inference approach of fuzzy requires 250,000 rules. For this study, we select eight variables as input because these taken from the survey of a city. This proposed method will also used for the system with several parameters. In traditional fuzzy inference, there are several rules exponentially increases, also with the additional of new parameters. Integrated hierarchical fuzzy inference approach used for computing the performance index of the whole system. The index values traces the possibility of system failure and results shows the performance values under different circumstances. Â© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.",
1132,"Soil moisture response to snowmelt timing in mixed-conifer subalpine forests Western US forest ecosystems and downstream water supplies are reliant on seasonal snowmelt. Complex feedbacks govern forest-snow interactions in which forests influence the distribution of snow and the timing of snowmelt but are also sensitive to snow water availability. Notwithstanding, few studies have investigated the influence of forest structure on snow distribution, snowmelt and soil moisture response. Using a multi-year record from co-located observations of snow depth and soil moisture, we evaluated the influence of forest-canopy position on snow accumulation and snow depth depletion, and associated controls on the timing of soil moisture response at Boulder Creek, Colorado, Jemez River Basin, New Mexico, and the Wolverton Basin, California. Forest-canopy controls on snow accumulation led to 12-42cm greater peak snow depths in open versus under-canopy positions. Differences in accumulation and melt across sites resulted in earlier snow disappearance in open positions at Jemez and earlier snow disappearance in under-canopy positions at Boulder and Wolverton sites. Irrespective of net snow accumulation, we found that peak annual soil moisture was nearly synchronous with the date of snow disappearance at all sites with an average deviation of 12, 3 and 22days at Jemez, Boulder and Wolverton sites, respectively. Interestingly, sites in the Sierra Nevada showed peak soil moisture prior to snow disappearance at both our intensive study site and the nearby snow telemetry stations. Our results imply that the duration of soil water stress may increase as regional warming or forest disturbance lead to earlier snow disappearance and soil moisture recession in subalpine forests.

1133,"[Cutaneous manifestations of arsenicisme in Burkina Faso: epidemiological and clinical features] The main aetiology of human arsenic toxicity provide from natural geological source. The characteristic skin lesions of arsenic toxicity may be used as an indicator of high exposure. We have registered 45 cases. The age bracket was one to 70 years. We have registered 27 women (60%) and 18 men (40%). The cutaneous manifestations have been dominated by the palmo plantar hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentations (77,8% each one). The urinary concentrations of arsenic were 13 microg/l to 212 microg/l; they were 69 to 101 microg/l in the drinking water localized in the golden area, however they were normal outside this area. The clinical features were similar with the description of the literature. Intoxication of drinking water is problem of public health and we recommend checking all the other golden areas to find some appropriate solutions.",1
1134,"Validation of two applied methods of groundwater vulnerability mapping: application to the coastal aquifer system of Southern Sfax (Tunisia) The coastal aquifers system of Sfax Agareb Chaffar Mahres (Southern Sfax) located in the central east of Tunisia is well known for population growth and industrial development. These industrial and agricultural developments have led to the degradation of water quality. In this study, DRASTIC and GALDIT models were integrated with geographical information system (GIS) tools, in order to assess the aquifers vulnerability to pollution and the seawater intrusion risk. These methods use different parameters explaining the different results in the vulnerability degrees in the Aghereb-Chaffar-Mahres aquifer system. The vulnerability map to contamination as well as vulnerability to seawater intrusion showed three classes of vulnerability: low, moderate and high, depending on the intrinsic properties. In addition, the risk map showed three risk classes: low, moderate and high depending on hydrogeological characteristics, land use, distance from the coast and human impacts in the majority of the study area. GIS is used to manage, manipulate and analyze the necessary geographical data used in the different vulnerability methods. These maps could serve as a scientific basis for sustainable land use planning and groundwater management in Southern Sfax.",
1135,"Adsorption performance and mechanistic study of heavy metals by facile synthesized magnetic layered double oxide/carbon composite from spent adsorbent To reuse the spent magnetic MgAl-layered double hydroxide after humic acid adsorption, this work provided a simple calcination method to prepare the magnetic layered double oxide/carbon (Mag-LDO/C) nanocomposite. The characterization results indicated the Mag-LDO/C was a carbonaceous composite with a large number of functional groups and superparamagnetic property. Then the adsorption performance of Mag-LDO/C for heavy metals was studied by batch experiments. The Mag-LDO/C exhibited excellent removal efficiencies for Cd(II), Pb (II), and Cu(II) with maximum adsorption capacities of 386.1, 359.7, and 192.7 mg/g, respectively. The batch sorption data were studied by the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and the Langmuir isothermal model, and they matched well. According to the zeta potentials, X-ray diffraction patterns, and X-ray photoelectron spectra of Mag-LDO/C after heavy metals adsorption, the interaction mechanisms were ascribed to the precipitation, surface complexation, and electrostatic attraction. After reaction, the solid-liquid separation of Mag-LDO/C could quickly achieve using a magnet. Additionally, the Mag-LDH/C exhibited excellent adsorption capacities in various simulated wastewater and well sorption recyclability, proving the valuable applications of Mag-LDO/C synthesized from spent adsorbent for metal ions removal in actual water environment.",

1137,"Recycled crustal melt injection into lithospheric mantle: implication from cumulative composite and pyroxenite xenoliths A rare composite xenolith and abundant cumulative pyroxenites obtained from the Mesozoic Fangcheng basalts on the eastern North China Craton record a complex history of melt percolation and circulation in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The composite xenolith has a dunite core and an olivine clinopyroxenite rim. The dunite is of cumulative origin and has a granular recrystallized texture and extremely low Mg# [100 Mg/(Mg + Fe) = 81-82] contents in olivines. The olivine clinopyroxenite contains larger clinopyroxene and/or orthopyroxene with a few fine-grained olivine and tiny phlogopite, feldspar, and/or carbonate minerals interstitial to clinopyroxene. The clinopyroxene has low Mg# (83-85). Compositional similarity between dunitic olivine and pyroxenitic one indicates a sequential crystallization of dunite and pyroxenite from a precursor melt. Pyroxenite xenoliths include olivine websterites and clinopyroxenites, both are of cumulative origin. Estimation of the melt from major oxides in olivines and REE concentrations in clinopyroxenes in these composite and pyroxenite xenoliths suggests a derivation from subducted crustal materials, consistent with the highly enriched EMII-like Sr and Nd isotopic ratios observed in the pyroxenites. Occurrence of phlogopite, feldspar and carbonate minerals in some xenoliths requires the melt rich in alkalis (K, Na), silica and volatiles (water and CO2) at the latest stage as well, similar to highly silicic and potassic melts. Thus, the occurrence of these composite and pyroxenite xenoliths provides an evidence for voluminous injection of recycled crustal melts into the lithosphere beneath the southeastern North China Craton at the Late Mesozoic, a reason for the rapid lithospheric enrichment in both elemental and isotopic compositions.",
1138,"Application of composite fly ash gel to extinguish outcrop coal fires in China This paper presents the application of composite fly ash gel injection technology, along with several other methods to help extinguish outcrop coal fires (excavation, blasting and sealing). The Haibaoqing coal fires extended for 6000-7000 m across similar to 1000-m-wide area, part of which was simulated by Fluent to determine the distribution of high temperature and the situation of leakage. The radon-test method was used to accurately detect the extent of the burning area, along with the degree and tendency of burning. The areas were then separated into three distinct regions: north, middle and south. The gel injecting and monitoring boreholes were then installed in the regions. A comprehensive application of composite fly ash gel injection technology, excavation, blasting and sealing was used to extinguish the outcrop coal fire. After subsurface blasting, the composite gel was injected into the coal seams to extinguish and prevent re-ignition of the fires by filling in new areas created by the blasting and forming an effective composite coverage in order to prevent combustion. Boreholes monitored temperature and CO concentrations during the entire process to indicate when the fire was extinguished, along with extended monitoring to verify no combustion reoccurred. Using this combination of methods has proven to effectively extinguish the coal fires at reasonable costs in the region.",
1139,"Tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate-basd ionic liquids as advantageous solid-phase micro-extraction coatings for the extraction of organophosphate esters in environmental waters Ionic liquids (ILs) containing the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate [FAP] anion and various cations have great potential in sample preparation because of their excellent hydrophobicity, thermostability and low hydrolysity. In the present study, a [FAP]-based IL, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tris (pentafluoroethyl) trifluoro phosphate ([HMIM][FAP]), was used as coatings of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for extracting organophosphate esters (OPEs) from environmental water samples. This SPME fiber was fabricated by coating a stainless steel wire substrate with [HMIM][FAP] via a simple direct dip-coating approach, and the extraction was conducted by the direct immersion solid phase microextraction. Coupling to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the developed SPME method exhibited excellent selectivity and sensitivity towards the extraction of 11 OPEs from aqueous samples. Satisfactory linearity (R-2 >= 0.99) of the calibration curves was obtained over the range of 0.05-50.0 ng mL(-1) with the limits of detection (LODs, S/N = 3) and limits of quantification (LOQs, S/N = 10) ranged from 0.13-7.40 ng L-1 and 0.50-24.0 ng L-1, respectively. The proposed SPME method showed excellent extraction efficiency to OPEs with enrichment factors in the range of 168-2603, and acceptable reproducibility with relative standard deviations (RSDs) <= 15% for single fiber (n = 7) and <= 16% for fiber-to-fiber (n = 3 x 3) at a concentration level of 0.5 ng mL(-1), respectively. The prepared IL-based fiber was successfully applied to determine eleven common used OPEs in tap water, influent and effluent of sewage treatment plant, with results are comparable to those determined by the reference (UPLC-MS/MS), and spiked recoveries in the range of 84.0-108%, 82.1-123% and 82.8-100%, respectively.

1140,"A brief study of adsorption of Congo red dye over sawdust of Cedrus deodara Adsorptive removal of Congo red dye from aqueous media has been carried out by using sawdust of Cedrus deodara saw as an efficient adsorbent by evaluating different parameters such as adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, initial dye concentration, and temperature at constant shaking time of five minutes by using a Benchtop orbital shaker to homogenize adsorption medium that develops more attractive forces between C. deodara saw and dye molecules lead to higher adsorption values. The C. deodara saw surface morphology was monitored by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The adsorption experimental data was studied by applying the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isothermal models, and data was well obeyed by D-R isotherm based on R-2 and SSE (0.996, 0.004) values. The kinetics of the adsorption process was investigated by pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, liquid film, and intra-particle diffusion models. Kinetics indicated that the pseudo-second-order model behaves as the most favored model with a 1.0 R-2 value but the adsorption process can also be explained with the help of more than one kinetic mechanism (liquid film and intra-particle models). The values for thermodynamic parameters such as Delta G, Delta S, and Delta H were indicating the spontaneity and endothermic nature of the reaction. The applicability of the developed procedure was studied in tap water with 94% removal of Congo red dye. These results suggested that sawdust of C. deodara could be used as a low-cost alternative waste material adsorbent for synthetic dye removal.",
1141,"Folate Deficiency, Hyperhomocysteinemia, Low Urinary Creatinine, and Hypomethylation of Leukocyte DNA Are Risk Factors for Arsenic-induced Skin Lesions BACKGROUND: Arsenic methylation relies on folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and facilitates urinary As elimination. Clinical manifestations of As toxicity vary considerably among individuals and populations, and poor methylation capacity is thought to confer greater susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: After determining that folate deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia, and low urinary creatinine are associated with reduced As methylation, and that As exposure is associated with increased genomic methylation of leakocyte DNA, we asked whether these factors are associated with As-induced skin lesion risk among Bangladeshi adults. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of 274 cases who developed lesions 2 years after recruitment, and 274 controls matched to cases for sex, age, and water As. RESULTS: The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for development of skin lesions for participants who had low folate (< 9 nmol/L), hyperhomocysteinemia (men, > 11.4 mu mol/L; women, > 10.4 mu mol/L), or hypomethylated leukocyte DNA at recruitment (< median) were 1.8 (95% Cl, 1.1-2.9), 1.7 (95% Cl, 1.1-2.6), and 1.8 (95% Cl, 1.2-2.8), respectively. Compared with the subjects in the first quartile, those in the third and fourth quartiles for urinary creatinine had a 0.4-fold decrease in the odds of skin lesions (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that folate deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia, and low urinary creatinine, each associated with decreased As methylation, are risk factors for As-induced skin lesions. The increased DNA methylation associated with As exposure previously observed, and confirmed among controls in this study, may be an adaptive change because hypomethylation of leukocyte DNA is associated with increased risk for skin lesions.",
1142,"High uranium concentrations in groundwater in Burundi Uranium occurs naturally in groundwater and frequently exceeds maximum admissible concentration levels. Here we present the results of a study from Burundi where dissolved uranium concentrations can exceed 700 mu g/L. A conceptual model is proposed that relates these high levels to strong evapotranspiration of groundwater where uranium appears by dissolution of minerals from the granitic host rock. The proposed model is consistent with water balance considerations and corroborated by simulations using the geochemical code PHREEQC. Varying degrees of evapotranspiration, mineral dissolution and uranium concentrations of the source rock account for the large variation of the chemical composition of groundwater observed in the study area. These findings highlight the need for caution when developing water supply systems in the vicinity of groundwater discharge zones characterized by strong evapo-concentration. (C) 2017 The Authors.

1143,"Principle and capacity quantification of deep-borehole heat exchangers Deep-Borehole Heat Exchanger (DBHE) is generally installed as a co-axial pipe in deep boreholes. The DBHE can obtain heat without extracting groundwater. Literature review shows that the specific heat extraction rate of DBHE is less than 200 W . m(-1), which is much smaller than that by conventional hydrothermal exploitation systems. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we evaluated the capacity of DBHE with representative parameters in northern China. Three modeling scenarios were constructed using the simulator OpenGeoSys, including (1) shortterm (4 months) continuous heat extraction; (2) short-term heat extraction with half-day intervals and (3) long-term (30 years) continuous heat extraction. Results show that the sustainable heat extraction rates in all continuous extraction scenarios are less than 150 W.m(-1). While in the intermittent scenario, the rate could be doubled, but will lead to larger fluctuations in the outflow temperature. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the depth of borehole is not a significant influencing factor to the heat extraction rate, while the heat conductivity of surrounding formation is critical. Finally, we point out that the basic need in order to increase the specific heat extraction rate of a DBHE is to increase the convection in the surrounding formation, or in other words, the contact area between circulation water and formation.",
1144,"Modeling Equitable Distribution of Water: Dynamic Inversion-Based Controller Approach It is a well-known fact that most of the developing countries have intermittent water supply and the quantity of water supplied from the source is also not distributed equitably among the consumers. Aged pipelines, pump failures, and improper management of water resources are some of the main reasons for it. This study presents the application of a nonlinear control technique to overcome this problem in different zones in the city of Bangalore. The water is pumped to the city from a large distance of approximately 100km over a very high elevation of approximately 400m. The city has large undulating terrain among different zones, which leads to unequal distribution of water. The Bangalore, inflow water-distribution system (WDS) has been modeled. A dynamic inversion (DI) nonlinear controller with proportional integral derivative (PID) features (DI-PID) is used for valve throttling to achieve the target flows to different zones of the city. This novel approach of equitable water distribution using DI-PID controllers that can be used as a decision support system is discussed in this paper.",
1145,"Physicochemical Profile of Ground Water in Bahawalpur City, Pakistan: Hazardous Aspects Analysis of ground water of Bahawalpur city, Pakistan, has been made to evaluate its suitability for domestic use. Water samples from populated areas of the city were subjected to various physicochemical investigations. Physical properties of ground water were assessed by determining color, odor, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved salts (TDS), alkalinity, hardness and dissolved oxygen (DO). Whereas, its chemical nature was evaluated by estimating pH, Cl-, F-, NO3-, SO4-2, Cl-, F-, essential (Na, K, Ca, Mg) and heavy (Fe, Ni, Cr, As, Pb) metals. The presence of coliform bacteria was also checked and 75% samples were found contaminated. The analysis of physicochemical data, with reference to PSI and WHO standards, revealed that some of the estimated parameters were well within the limit, while others exceeded hydrochemical standards. The data was also subjected to correlation study to check the association among estimated parameters. Relation of important water quality parameters with pH was sketched graphically to understand variation in their amount with the change in pH. The study suggests proper treatment of ground water to ensure citizen's safety from hazardous effects associated with elevated concentration of toxic components.",1
1146,"Assessing of genotoxicity of 16 centralized source-waters in China by means of the SOS/umu assay and the micronucleus test: Initial identification of the potential genotoxicants by use of a GC/MS method and the QSAR Toolbox 3.0 Only few studies were conducted to assess genotoxicity of centralized source waters in China and almost none of them dealt with the causal relationship between the genotoxic effect and genotoxicants. In this work, 16 centralized source waters in China were sampled from five river systems and genotoxicity of their organic extracts was assessed by use of the SOS/umu test for DNA-damaging effect and the miniaturized flow cytometry-based micronucleus (MN) test for chromosome-damaging effect. In addition, initial identification of potential genotoxicants for the six samples from the Yangtze River was done with a GC/MS method and the QSAR toolbox 3.0. The results demonstrate that eight samples showed both indirect and direct DNA-damaging effects, another four samples showed only indirect DNA-damaging effects, while chromosome-damaging effects were found for 14 out of the 16 samples, in which aneugenic and clastogenic modes of action were found for 4 and 10 samples, respectively. Both direct/indirect DNA-damaging effects and chromosome-damaging effects were induced by the six Yangtze River samples, and the existing different types of genotoxicant confirmed the results. Furthermore, o-phenylphenol was initially identified as the major cause for the DNA-damaging effects while PAHs, pesticides, phenol and anthraquinone were identified as ubiquitous chromosome-damaging agents among these samples. In conclusion, a combination of the SOS/umu test and the miniaturized flow cytometry-based MN test to detect both DNA-damaging and chromosome-damaging effects could be used as a comprehensive genotoxicity assessment tool for the evaluation and classification of genotoxicity of complex mixtures, and potential genotoxicants can be initially identified with additional information from chemical analysis and the QSAR toolbox.

1147,"Identifying and assessing human activity impacts on groundwater quality through hydrogeochemical anomalies and NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+), and COD contamination: a case study of the Liujiang River Basin, Hebei Province, P.R. China In the face of rapid economic development and increasing human activity, the deterioration of groundwater quality has seriously affected the safety of the groundwater supply in eastern China. Identifying and assessing the impact of human activities is key to finding solutions to this problem. This study is an effort to scientifically and systematically identify and assess the influence of human activities on groundwater based on irregularities in hydrochemical properties and water contamination, which are considered to directly result from anthropogenic activity. The combination of the hydrochemical anomaly identification (HAI) and the contaminant identification (CI) was proposed to identify the influence of human activities on groundwater quality. And the degree of abnormality was quantified by the background threshold value. The principal component analysis (PCA) and land use map were used to verify the reliability of the identification result. The final result show that the strong influence areas mainly distributed in the south of the basin and the affected indicators contained the major elements and NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+), COD. Impacts from anthropogenic activities can be divided into two types: mine drainage that disrupts natural water-rock interaction processes, agricultural cultivation, and sewage emissions that contribute to nitrate pollution.",
1148,"BEYOND THE DECADE - A FRAMEWORK FOR GLOBAL COOPERATION The International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD) was launched by the General Assembly of the United Nations in November 1980 with the goal ""to provide all people with water of safe quality and adequate quantity and basic sanitary facilities by 1990"". The World Bank estimates that despite the efforts during the Decade less than 50 percent of developing country populations have access to adequate water supplies and only 20 percent to adequate sanitation facilities. Major factors for the situation are the continuing population explosion and the economic stagnation of developing countries. Qualitative breakthroughs have been made however, through (i) improved coordination for sector inputs at the global and country levels, (ii) systematic formulation of country strategies, (iii) rationalization of the management of the sector, and most significantly through (iv) community involvement and (v) the adoption of low-cost sustainable and replicable technolgies. The UNDP/World Bank Programme and the UNDP/WHO Decade Programmes have played a catalytic role in developing activities in these five areas. To maintain Decade momentum beyond 1990 and to accelerate the provision of water supply and sanitation services to all, with emphasis on the unserved rural and peri-urban poor, by using a coordinated programme ""Decade""approach, a Framework for Global Cooperation has been established. A series of meetings of a Collaborative Council of External Support Agencies (ESAs) is involved, leading to a global consultation in India in 1990 for all developing countries to define and achieve consensus on a water and sanitation sector strategy for ""Beyond the Decade"".",
1149,"Utilising Cold Energy from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to Reduce the Electricity Cost of Data Centres The Office of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission has reported that, from 2014 to 2018, Thailand's internet usage has grown six-fold to 3.3 million terabytes per annum. This market trend highlights one of the policies of Thailand 4.0, with the aim of making Thailand a hub for information transfer in ASEAN. As a result, there will be a massive demand growth for data storage facilities in the near future. Data centres are regarded as the brain and heart of the digital industry and are essential for facilitating businesses in organising, processing, storing and disseminating large amounts of data. As the energy demand for equipment cooling contributes to over 37% of the total energy consumption, the data centres of the world's leading companies, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook, are generally located in cold climate zones, such as Iceland, in order to reduce operating costs for cooling. Due to this reason, the possibility of data centres in Thailand is limited. Beneficially, PTTLNG, as the first liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in Thailand, has processed the import, receiving, storage and regasification of LNG. The high abundance of cold energy inherently presented in LNG is normally lost to the surroundings during regasification. Presently, PTTLNG's LNG receiving terminal utilises a heat exchanger with propane as an intermediate fluid to transfer cold energy from LNG to water. This cold energy, in the form of cold water, is then used in several projects within the LNG receiving terminal: (1) production of electricity via an organic Rankine cycle capacity of 5 MWh; (2) cooling the air inlet of gas turbine generators to increase the generator efficiency; (3) replacing refrigerant heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems within buildings; (4) development of winter plantations with precision agriculture to replace imported products. Therefore, this study focuses on the potential and future use for LNG cold energy by performing a thermodynamic and economic analysis of the use of LNG cold energy as a source to produce cold water at 7 degrees C, with the total cold energy of 27.77 to 34.15 MW or 7934 t to 9757 t of refrigeration depending on the target pressure of the natural gas to replace the conventional cooling system of data centres. This research has the potential to reduce the cooling operation costs of data centres by more than USD 9.87 million per annum as well as CO2 emissions by 34,772 t per annum. In an economic study, this research could lead to a payback period of 7 years with IRR 13% for the LNG receiving terminal and a payback period of 2.21 years with IRR 45% for digital companies.",
1150,"Assessment of Agroeconomic Indicators of Sesamum indicum L. as Influenced by Application of Boron at Different Levels and Plant Growth Stages To achieve the nutritional target of human food, boron (B) has been described as an essential mineral in determining seed and theoretical oil yield of Sesamum indicum L. The research to increase its cultivation is garnering attention due to its high oil content, quality and its utilization for various purposes, which include human nutrition as well as its use in the food industry. For this, a two-year field experiment was performed at PAU, Punjab, India to determine the effect of different concentrations of foliar-applied B (20, 30 and 40 mg L-1) and different growth stages of crop, i.e., we measured the effects on agroeconomic indicators and certain quality parameters of sesame using different concentrations of B applied at the flowering and capsule formation stages as compared to using water spray and untreated plants. Water spray did not significantly affect the studied parameters. However, B application significantly increased the yield, uptake, antioxidant activity (AOA) and theoretical oil content (TOC) compared to those of untreated plants. The maximum increase in seed yield (26.75%), B seed and stover uptake (64.08% and 69.25%, respectively) as well as highest AOA (69.41%) and benefit to cost ratio (B:C ratio 2.63) was recorded when B was applied at 30 mg L-1 at the flowering and capsule formation stages. However, the maximum sesame yield and B uptake were recorded when B was applied at a rate of 30 mg L-1. A significant increase in TOC was also recorded with a B application rate of 30 mg L-1. For efficiency indices, the higher values of boron agronomic efficiency (BAE) and boron crop recovery efficiency (BCRE) were recorded when B was applied at 20 mg L-1 (5.25 and 30.56, respectively) and 30 mg L-1 (4.96 and 26.11, respectively) at the flowering and capsule formation stages. In conclusion, application of B @ 30 mg L-1 at the flowering and capsule formation stages seemed a viable technique to enhance yield, B uptake and economic returns of sesame.",
1151,"Inflammation biomarkers associated with arsenic exposure by drinking water and respiratory outcomes in indigenous children from three Yaqui villages in southern Sonora, Mexico Environmental arsenic exposure in adults and children has been associated with a reduction in the expression of club cell secretory protein (CC16) and an increase in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), both biomarkers of lung inflammation and negative respiratory outcomes. The objectives of this study were to determine if the levels of serum CC16 and MMP-9 and subsequent respiratory infections in children are associated with the ingestion of arsenic by drinking water. This cross-sectional study included 216 children from three Yaqui villages, Potam, Vicam, and Cocorit, with levels of arsenic in their ground water of 70.01 +/- 21.85, 23.3 +/- 9.99, and 11.8 +/- 4.42 mu g/L respectively. Total arsenic in water and urine samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometry. Serum was analyzed for CC16 and MMP-9 using ELISA. The children had an average urinary arsenic of 79.39 mu g/L and 46.8 % had levels above of the national concern value of 50 mu g/L. Increased arsenic concentrations in drinking water and average daily arsenic intake by water were associated with decreased serum CC16 levels (beta = - 0.12, 95% CI -0.20, -0.04 and beta = -0.10, 95% CI -0.18, -0.03), and increased serum MMP-9 levels (beta = 0.35, 95% CI 0.22, 0.48 and beta = 0.29, 95% CI 0.18, 0.40) at significant levels (P < 0.05). However, no association was found between levels of these serum biomarkers and urinary arsenic concentrations. In these children, reduced serum CC16 levels were significantly associated with increased risk of respiratory infections (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.90). In conclusion, altered levels of serum CC16 and MMP-9 in the children may be due to the toxic effects of arsenic exposure through drinking water.",1
1152,"Evaluation of irrigation water quality across major water resources in Albania during a five-year monitoring process The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of water for irrigation from several surface water sources in Albania. The study was made in seven rivers: Drini, Fan, Mat, Erzen, Shkumbin, Seman, and Vjosa, and in four reservoirs: Tapize, Xhalzotaj, Thane and Kurjan. The study was realized during 2006-2010. The samples were collected in a one-week period every year (varying from June 1st to August 30th) and were analyzed for pH, TDS, EC, chemical parameters (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+. Cl-, CO32-center dot HCO3- and SO42-), nutritional elements (N-NO3, N-NH4 and P) and heavy metals (Fe, Pb Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn and Mn) for Fan and Shkumbin rivers in 2010. The analytical results obtained were mostly within the accepted values set by the State Standard Catalogue, with the exception of Thana reservoir with high EC and TDS values. This was attributed to the reduction of water supply during the second half of August and to the high amount of Na+ and Cl- in the reservoir basin. There were also relatively high concentrations of NO3-N, NH4-N and K+ in this basin. The content of heavy metals in the Shkumbini river follows the order: Cr>Cu>Ni>Mn>Pb>fe>Zn, while for Fani river the order is: Cr>Pb>Ni>Fe>Cu>Mn>Zn. Most heavy metal contents in rani river were beyond the acceptable levels. Our results indicate that irrigation water resources of Albania, except for Thana, can be considered of good quality (class II). Anyway, since these water resources are continually threatened by urban, industrial and agricultural pollution, it is recommended to maintain a permanent monitoring program of the water quality.",
1153,"Casein based biogenic-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles simultaneously decontaminate heavy metals, dyes, and pathogenic microbes: a rational strategy for wastewater treatment BACKGROUNDWastewater management has become a great concern recently due to industrial and domestic discharges containing metals, organic pollutants and pathogenic microbes that contaminate water bodies and also cause waterborne diseases. Although there have been multiple conventional processes for removing contaminants, nanomaterials have recently gained importance for wastewater treatments. RESULTSHere, ZnONPCS with an average size of 10nm was successfully synthesized by using casein as biogenic reducing and capping agent. Removal of three metals and two dyes was investigated and it was found that nearly 90% was removed. Adsorption isotherm data were best fitted with the Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption capacity (mgg(-1)) was found to be 156.74 for Cd(II), 194.93 for Pd(II), 67.93 for Co(II), 115.47 for methylene blue and 62.19 for congo red. Repeated cycles of regeneration and reuse showed a drop in removal efficiency of 10-13%. Further, nanoparticles also showed efficient photo-degradation of dyes within 240min. Moreover, ZnONPCS demonstrated high antibacterial potential for Escherichia coli in the presence of metals and dyes. CONCLUSIONBiogenic synthesized ZnONPCS demonstrated simultaneous removal of metals, dyes as well as pathogenic microbes, and could be used as a cost-effective and reusable system in various industrial effluent treatments.

1154,"Effects of climate, land cover and topography on soil erosion risk in a semiarid basin of the Andes Understanding soil erosion processes in the Ecuadorian Andes with a tropical wet-dry climate and a variable topography, is fundamental for research on agriculture sustainable, environmental management, as well as for a stable water supply for the local populations. This work proposes method to estimate soil erosion risk in the semiarid Catamayo basin with limited data. The results show that the rainfall distribution and the erosivity along with the rugged topography, followed by the land cover (C-factor), are the most important factors to estimate soil erosion risk. The soil erodibility is the most important factor in the dry season for agricultural areas and where the ground cover is sparse. Soil erosion risk is higher in the centre and southwest than in the northeast of Catamayo basin. In protected areas with evergreen vegetation, the soil erosion risk is very low, even with steep slopes and high annual rainfall amounts. The methodology developed allows understanding of the soil erosion processes and the factors that lead to the spatio-temporal variability of soil erosion risk, and as a consequence improves the potential to achieve sustainability of this ecosystem through proposed conservation measures.

1155,"The disposing techniques of water treatment wastes containing arsenic - a review Solid waste management in developing countries is often unsustainable, relying on uncontrolled disposal in waste dumps. Particular problems arise from the disposal of treatment residues generated by removing arsenic (As) from drinking water because As can be highly mobile and has the potential to leach back to ground and surface waters. This paper reviews the disposal of water treatment wastes containing As, with a particular emphasis on stabilisation/solidification (S/S) technologies which are currently used to treat industrial wastes containing As. These have been assessed for their appropriateness for treating As containing water treatment wastes. Portland cement/lime mixes are expected (at least in part) to be appropriate for wastes from sorptive filters, but may not be appropriate for precipitative sludges, because ferric flocs often used to sorb As can retard cement hydration. Brine resulting from the regeneration of activated alumina filters is likely to accelerate cement hydration. Portland cement can immobilise soluble arsenites and has been successfully used to stabilise As-rich sludges and it may also be suitable for treating sludges generated from precipitative removal units. Oxidation of As(III) to As(V) and the formation of calcium-arsenic compounds are important immobilisation mechanisms for As in cements. Geopolymers are alternative binder systems that are effective for treating wastes rich in alumina and metal hydroxides and may have potential for As wastes generated using activated alumina. The long-term stability of cemented, arsenic-bearing wastes is however uncertain, as like many cements, they are susceptible to carbonation effects which may result in the subsequent re-release of As.",
1156,"Hydrochemical and isotopic assessment for characterizing groundwater quality and recharge processes under a semi arid area: Case of the Haouz plain aquifer (Central Morocco) The Haouz plain aquifer is one of the most important aquifers in Morocco. It is supporting so many activities tightly connected to the local and national socioeconomic development (agriculture, tourism, industry). The recurrent drought the region has been experiencing, had led to a major mobilization of groundwater to meet human needs and socioeconomic objectives. A hydrogeochemical, isotopic and statistical study based on field data was conducted to understand the functioning of the aquifer, to characterize the processes controlling the groundwater's chemistry, as well as identify areas presenting water salinity anomalies. The objective of this study is to develop a conceptual model of functioning of the Haouz aquifer, leading to a better comprehension of the spatial evolution of mineralization regarding the geological frame and the current context of exploitation to evaluate groundwater suitability for domestic and agricultural use. The Plio-Quaternary aquifer water-table contours map showed a flow direction from the High Atlas Mountains, in the south (recharge zone) towards the Tensift bed river in the northwest part of the region. Physico-chemical analysis showed that electrical conductivity are essentially controlled by the chloride and sodium ions and varies over a wide range from 326 to 6800 mu S/cm. Regarding irrigation, poor groundwater quality was defined specially near Tensift River in the north of the study area. Stable isotopes contents of water, range respectively from 8.35 to 5.26 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and from 54.4 to 32.4 parts per thousand for delta D. The recharge altitude of the aquifer was estimated between 860 and 2110 m, following an attitudinal gradient of 0.25% per 100 m.",
1157,"Delineation of Groundwater Potential Zones of Coastal Groundwater Basin Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making Technique Delineation of groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) has been performed for a coastal groundwater basin of eastern India. The groundwater potential zone index (GWPZI) map is generated by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) from different influencing features, e.g., Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC), soil (S), geomorphology (GM), hydrogeology (HG), surface geology (SG), recharge rate (RR), drainage density (DD), rainfall (RF), slope (Sl), surface water bodies (SW), lineament density (LD), and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI). Recharge rate values are estimated from hydrological water balance model. Overlay weighted sum method is used to integrate all thematic feature maps to generate GWPZ map of the study area. Four zones have been identified for the coastal groundwater basin [very good: 36.39 % (273.53 km(2), good: 43.57 % (327.47 km(2)), moderate: 18.27 % (137.30 km(2)), and poor: 1.77 % (13.27 km(2))]. Areas in north to south-west and south-east direction show very good GWPZ due to the presence of low drainage density. GWPZ map and well yield values show good agreement. Sensitivity analysis reveals that exclusion/absence of rainfall and lineament density increases the poor groundwater potential zones. Omission of hydrogeology, soils, surface geology, and NDVI show maximum increase in good GWPZ. Obtained GWPZ map can be utilized effectively for planning of sustainable agriculture. This analysis demonstrates the potential applicability of the methodology for a general coastal groundwater basin.",
1158,"Calculation of water volume in step wells for cyclopicide application and its eco-epidemiological implication: mathematical validation of some theoretical considerations Chemical treatment of step wells to kill cyclopoid vectors of guinea worm by temephos (50 per cent E. C.) at the dose of 1 ppm is now an important activity of the guineaworm eradication programme in India. Calculation of correct volume of water in step wells, to determine the exact quantity of temephos to be applied, therefore, deserves adequate attention to prevent over and underdosing of stepwells by the chemical. The prescribed method of calculation of water volume includes two formulae; pi r2h and 1 x b x h (where h = mean depth for uneven bottoms and is a single depth measurement for almost even bottoms). Field observations revealed that in many stepwells there were marked variations in depth within the same well. These differences in depth ranged from small to very large in some wells. Since these depth variations would lead to miscalculation of water volume by existing method and the dose of temephos to be applied, with eco-epidemiological consequences, new formulae have therefore been deduced for conceivable patterns of depth variations by geometrical and algebric applications. The new formulae will permit calculation of, nearest to, exact quantity of temephos required for application. These formulae have been validated by an example.",
1159,"Quality of sources of drinking water and health among the hill tribe people of northern Thailand Poor-quality drinking water can cause numerous health problems, particularly for people who are living with poor economic conditions, have a low educational status and have limited access to safe drinking water, such as the hill tribe people in Thailand. This study aimed to assess the quality of different sources of natural drinking water from the hill tribe villages in northern Thailand. Seventy-two drinking water samples from the hill tribe villages were collected and tested for biological, chemical and physical qualities, which were compared with the standard parameter values for safe drinking water according to the World Health Organization. Total coliform bacteria and fecal coliform bacteria, which represented the biological parameters, were detected in all samples. The physical parameters, which consisted of turbidity (36.1%), iron content (5.5%), color (2.7%) and pH (2.7%), exceeded the standard indications. However, the hazard quotient and hazard index values were less than 1. The hill tribe people are facing the problem of poor-quality drinking water, particularly in terms of biological and physical parameters that exceed the standard values. An effective program for improving access to safe water for the hill tribe people should be developed and implemented immediately.",1
1160,"Microplastics and associated PAHs in surface water from the Feilaixia Reservoir in the Beijiang River, China Microplastics have been a prevalent and persistent contamination problem in the global aquatic environment. In particular, microplastics that can adsorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and therefore transfer these POPs to organisms in the aquatic environment have received much attention. In this study, an investigation of microplastics in the surface water of the Feilaixia Reservoir (Guangdong Province, China), which is an important part of people's daily lives in Guangdong Province was carried out, mainly focusing on the characteristics and spatial distribution of microplastics, as well as microplastics and their adsorded PAHs in the surface water of the Feilaixia Reservoir were investigated. The average abundance of microplastics in the surface water of the Feilaixia Reservoir was 0.56â€¯Â±â€¯0.45 items/m(3). Six kinds of polymers, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were identified, among which PP (52.31%) and PE (27.39%) were the major compositions. Four shapes of microplastics, i.e., foams, films, fragments and fibers were found, and films (37.78%) being the main shape. The most common typical size of the plastic particles ranged from 0.6 to 2â€¯mm (41.36%). The total concentration of the sixteen PAHs carried on the EPS, PE and PP microplastics ranged from 282.4 to 427.3â€¯ng/g; chrysene, benzo [ghi] perylene, and phenanthrene were abundant in the samples, at concentrations of 39.5-89.6â€¯ng/g, 34.6-56.8â€¯ng/g and 25.6-45.6â€¯ng/g, respectively. Based on the ratios of the PAH isomers (Flut/Pyâ€¯<â€¯1 and Phe/Ant >10), it was speculated that the source of the PAHs may be derived from the imperfect combustion of fossil fuels.",

1162,"Effect of decreasing soil organic matter content and tillage on physical properties of sandy Sahelian soils The semiarid tropical zones in West Africa, in particular the so-called ""Sahel"" and ""Sudan-Savanna"" zones, with annual rainfall of 200-500 mm and 600-900 mm respectively, are facing serious problems. A harsh climate (a long dry season and a short rainy season with aggressive, unpredictable rainfall) and light, unstable soils with a poor nutrient content and very low soil organic matter levels do not contribute to acceptable yields of arable crops or biomass from natural vegetation. In addition, the high population pressure is causing a serious overgrazing of the rangelands (which form a very important part of the agricultural production system) and an almost complete removal of crop residue from arable fields. As a result, there is a decrease in soil organic matter content and soil biological activity. This causes not only soil chemical impoverishment, but also a physical degradation of the soil. Due to its typically light (loamy) texture, the majority of the region's soils are crust susceptible. Consequently, further physical degradation will lead to higher runoff losses, less natural vegetation, and a risk of crop production failure in low rainfall years. As part of a multi-disciplinary research project on sustainable management of natural resources in West Africa, the possibilities for water and nutrient conservation are under investigation. In field experiments using small plots with rainfall simulation and large runoff plots with varying slope length under natural rainfall, we are attempting to quantify runoff and nutrient losses as a function of scale. This paper reports on research carried out in Burkina Faso to assess the effect of soil organic matter (SOM) on soil physical characteristics and on the infiltration process. Soils with different intensity of use (which is evident by difference in organic matter content) were chosen. Rainfall simulator tests were run and some physical characteristics were determined. It was found that a lower organic matter content leads to high runoff losses and (slightly) higher erosion losses. Soil roughness of soils superficially tilled with a manual hoe decreased after rainfall to a level even lower than before tillage. In addition to well-known effects on soil nutrient behavior, organic matter was found to have a positive effect on the surface water balance of these light, structureless soils.",
1163,"A multi-site approach towards integrating environmental management in the wine production industry Nine wineries and a water bottling plant situated in the Franschhoek Valley, South Africa, have decided to lead the way towards creating a safer and more sustainable environment in the Valley. As part of the Vignerons de Franschhoek ECO Association (VFEA), they adopted a multi-site approach and obtained, in December 2003, the first ISO 14001 multi-site certification in South Africa. This proactive approach allows them better overall environmental performances through mutual motivation, information sharing and comparison of practices by the different participating organisations of the Valley. At the initiation of the project, the major concerns were associated with a lack of sound environmental management and training of employees. Of particular concern was also the lack of monitoring and measurement of environmental performance key indicators, especially in water consumption and wastewater disposal areas. Although the system is still in its juvenile stage, it already showed some effluent quality improvements through better wastewater management, better control over chemical stores as well as definite improvement in water management and increase in solid wastes recycling. The latter improvements will definitely entail long term cost savings should the system be continually and properly maintained. It is the intention of the VFEA to create a more environmentally friendly Valley by convincing others to be more environmentally responsive and expanding the ISO 14001 principles to other areas of the organisations including the farms, to other wineries and ultimately to the whole Franschhoek Valley.",
1164,"Partial stress drop and frictional overshoot mechanism of seismic events induced by mining The values of uniformly estimated apparent stress, Ïƒ(a), and Brune's stress drop, taken as a measure of static stress drop, from 850 seismic events, with moment magnitude ranging from -3.6 to 3.6, induced at the Underground Research Laboratory (URL) in Canada, Western Deep Levels (WDL) gold mine in South Africa, and two coal and two copper mines in Poland, were collected to study the stress release mode in various mining environments. For this, the quantity epsilon, Îµ = Î”Ïƒ/(Ïƒ(a) + Î”Ïƒ/2), where Î”Ïƒ is the static stress drop, proposed by Zuniga (1993) as an indicator of stress drop mechanism was used. The events induced at the URL are characterized by low values of epsilon corresponding to a partial stress drop mechanism, whereas all the events at WDL display frictional overshoot mechanism in which final stress reaches a lower value than that of frictional stress. The events at Polish coal and cooper mines, on the other hand, are in good agreement with the well-known Orowan's condition that the final stress is equal to the dynamic frictional stress. The Brune stress drop, however, is heavily model dependent through the source radius-corner frequency relation. The Orowan's condition for the events from the URL would be met if a constant in the source radius-corner frequency relation is equal to 1.82 Â± 0.12, and for the events from WDL if it is equal to 3.92 Â± 0.40, in contrast to Brune's constant of 2.34. The smoothed values of epsilon displayed as a function of time, represented by the consecutive event numbers, for selected sets of events imply that the largest seismic events in a given set occur when the epsilon is low and a partial stress drop mechanism is dominant. The large events are then followed by high epsilon values when a frictional overshoot mechanism begins to dominate.",
1165,"Load development In the Himalayan foot hills, there is a significant amount of electricity generated by isolated run-of-river hydro schemes. Load factors are often as low as 18%, and yet evening peaks are sometimes difficult to meet. Against this background of ""spare"" energy,there is enormous pressure on fuel wood, and suppressed demand for alternative fuels such as LPG. This paper looks at ways of improving load factors, to reduce CO2 emissions, and improve the economics of present and future mini hydro schemes. In an example from Sri Lanka, the rural grids in some areas were suffering ""brown-outs"" during the peak evening load time, and a massive upgrading of the lines looked inevitable. In an innovative move, several rural industrial consumers (mainly tea and rubber factories) were offered a reduced tariff if they accepted dual tariff meters which charged high rates between the hours of 6pm and 9pm(""peak"" times). The factories found no problem in modifying their production schedules, they made savings to their bills, and the ""brown-out"" problem disappeared. All parties gain in this situation, at very little added cost or complexity. Storage type appliances (storage heaters, insulated hot water geysers and storage cookers) can be combined with dual tariffs to significantly increase domestic load factors. Low cost timer units are available which can tolerate power cuts, and switch appliances on and off automatically at preset times. At least 6 countries including UK use this method. The paper looks at pricing off peak electricity to compete with domestic charcoal, LPG, coal and fuelwood. In India, small connections are sometimes given on a fixed monthly payment basis. This has advantages as no meter or meter reading is needed, but can lead to overloading problems if there is no precise control on the peak current drawn by the consumer. In Zimbabwe, Nepal, Eritrea and elsewhere, current limited connections are common, where the customer buys 100W, or 250W, or even 1kW, on a fixed tariff basis. Tamper proof auto-resetting current limiting devices then control the maximum current going to the dwelling. Load limiting connections can be 50% cheaper than metered connections to install. The paper looks at the potential for these techniques in India The paper also looks at international experience in innovative tariff collection systems, including community involvement and pre-payment meters, and how it may help in the Indian situation. Electrification is one of the largest industries in the world New consumer connection technology is being developed in India and elsewhere. Indian industry is well placed to benefit from innovations in this sector. This section of the Hilly Hydro project is very challenging and complex, but the relative lack of innovation in demand side management, combined with an ample resource of off-peak electricity, provides significant opportunities for change, Whilst reductions in fuelwood use for poor rural consumers will be difficult, there are many other users who can switch from fuelwood and other CO2 producing fuels. The national potential is very significant.",
1166,"[Spatio-temporal characteristics and source identification of water pollutants in Wenruitang River watershed] Identifying the temp-spatial distribution and sources of water pollutants is of great significance for efficient water quality management pollution control in Wenruitang River watershed, China. A total of twelve water quality parameters, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+ -N), electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity (Turb), nitrite-N (NO2-), nitrate-N(NO3-), phosphate-P(PO4(3-), total organic carbon (TOC) and silicate (SiO3(2-)), were analyzed from September, 2008 to October, 2009. Geographic information system(GIS) and principal component analysis(PCA) were used to determine the spatial distribution and to apportion the sources of pollutants. The results demonstrated that TN, NH4+ -N, PO4(3-) were the main pollutants during flow period, wet period, dry period, respectively, which was mainly caused by urban point sources and agricultural and rural non-point sources. In spatial terms, the order of pollution was tertiary river > secondary river > primary river, while the water quality was worse in city zones than in the suburb and wetland zone regardless of the river classification. In temporal terms, the order of pollution was dry period > wet period > flow period. Population density, land use type and water transfer affected the water quality in Wenruitang River.",
1167,"Residence times of groundwater and nitrate transport in coastal aquifer systems: Daweijia area, northeastern China Groundwater within the coastal aquifer systems of the Daweijia area in northeastern China is characterized by a large of variations (33-521mg/L) in NO3(-) concentrations. Elevated nitrate concentrations, in addition to seawater intrusion in the Daweijia well field, both attributable to anthropogenic activities, may impact future water-management practices. Chemical and stable isotopic (Î´(18)O, Î´(2)H) analysis, (3)H and CFCs methods were applied to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the distribution of groundwater mean residence time (MRT) and nitrate transport, and to identify sources of nitrate concentrations in the complex coastal aquifer systems. There is a relatively narrow range of isotopic composition (ranging from -8.5 to -7.0â€°) in most groundwater. Generally higher tritium contents observed in the wet season relative to the dry season may result from rapid groundwater circulation in response to the rainfall through the preferential flow paths. In the well field, the relatively increased nitrate concentrations of groundwater, accompanied by the higher tritium contents in the wet season, indicate the nitrate pollution can be attributed to domestic wastes. The binary exponential and piston-flow mixing model (BEP) yielded feasible age distributions based on the conceptual model. The good inverse relationship between groundwater MRTs (92-467years) and the NO3(-) concentrations in the shallow Quaternary aquifers indicates that elevated nitrate concentrations are attributable to more recent recharge for shallow groundwater. However, there is no significant relationship between the MRTs (8-411years) and the NO3(-) concentrations existing in the carbonate aquifer system, due to the complex hydrogeological conditions, groundwater age distributions and the range of contaminant source areas. Nitrate in the groundwater system without denitrification effects could accumulate and be transported for tens of years, through the complex carbonate aquifer matrix and the successive inputs of nitrogen from various sources.",
1168,"Mechanizing water lifting through pumps: A case study in sri lanka A reliable supply of water is critical for agricultural intensification and yield improvement. Technological devices that lift, transport and apply water contribute to increased yield from improved crop varieties and high input cultivation. Using such devices to shift to high-value cultivation has become an important source of wealth accumulation in Asia and Africa. In particular, the increasing use of motor pumps is a significant contribution to the development of small-scale irrigation. The objective of this study was to identify and analyze the trajectories of technological innovations and uptake for agricultural water management in farming systems in Sri Lanka, with a special focus on identifying impacts, emerging issues and potential responses to the rapid proliferation of motor pumps in the intensification of agriculture in the country. The Government of Sri Lanka promoted the rapid adoption of water pumps through interventions such as the development of groundwater wells for agriculture; provision of subsidies and credit facilities for purchasing micro-irrigation equipment; and government policies on tax, tariffs and extension support. At the same time, the high profit margin realized from cash crop cultivation motivated farmers to invest in water lifting and related technologies. Finally, water scarcity and restrictions on the use of surface water, i.e., canals, prompted a shift to using water-lifting technologies to pump groundwater. The use of water pumps in agriculture has expanded the area under cultivation; increased cropping intensity, especially during the dry seasons; changed the cropping pattern from low-return rice cultivation to high-return cash crop cultivation; and enhanced household incomes. Expanded and intensified cultivation has provided more opportunities for women to participate in agriculture, generating additional income, and enhancing their purchasing power and decision-making at the household level. Some farmers do not have groundwater wells and water pumps because they lack the necessary capital to make the initial investment. Smallholder farmers, in particular, are reluctant to risk their limited income on new technologies. This may lead to the further marginalization of poor farmers. Inclusive intensification will require helping farmers to access irrigation technology, for example, through carefully targeted subsidies and access to credit. Using water pumps can provide benefits to both users and non-users, but uncontrolled groundwater extraction may also create new problems by putting enormous pressure on common property resources. The government will need to take on a dual role to both promote the inclusive growth of small-scale irrigation, and to prevent and mitigate its negative environmental impacts. This second role may include establishing a regulatory system, setting standards for well construction, and monitoring and enforcing standards on extraction and water quality. There is an urgent need for institutional measures and governance arrangements to guide and regulate groundwater irrigation, especially in the context of intensive cultivation using shallow aquifers.

1169,"Distribution of Trace Elements in Groundwater around Beris Lalang Landfill Bachok, Kelantan, Malaysia The present study was conducted in the vicinity of Beris Lalang landfill, part of state Kelantan, Malaysia to determine the distribution of trace elements concentration in groundwater. A total of eleven groundwater samples and two surface water samples were analyzed for lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr) and aluminium (Al) using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). These probe elements were further categorized as toxic metals (i.e. Pb), transition metals (i.e. Mn), metallic elements (i.e. Cu, Fe, Zn, Cr), and non-metallic elements (i.e. Al). This study shows that few groundwater samples have marginally high concentration of Mn, Pb, Fe and Cr as per W.H.O. standard for potable water. The high concentration of metal ions in groundwater is likely due to untreated effluents from landfill site, municipal wastewater, fertilizers and other activities. To help identifying the contamination sources, the study recommends that regular monitoring of the groundwater quality should be undertaken both temporally and spatially that can contribute in public health and as well agricultural uses.",1
1170,"Cross-Sectional Analysis of Critical Risk Factors for PPP Water Projects in China During the past decades in China, the traditional state monopoly has experienced difficulties in meeting the huge demand for new infrastructure and improvement in service levels, engendering the growth of different forms and degrees of private sector involvement. Since the 1990s, China has started experimenting with the public-private partnership (PPP) delivery method in the water supply sector. However, many problems stemming from unsuccessful risk management have been encountered in PPP applications that have eventually led to project failure. This paper aims to identify and evaluate typical risks associated with PPP projects in the Chinese water supply sector. A literature review, a Delphi survey, and face-to-face interviews were used to achieve these objectives. Finally, a register of 16 critical risk factors (CRFs) of water PPP projects in China was established. The findings revealed that completion risk, inflation, and price change risk have a higher impact on Chinese water PPP projects, whereas government corruption, an imperfect law and supervision system, and a change in market demand have a lower impact on the water supply sector. The findings can help project stakeholders to improve the efficiency of privatization in public utility service and provide private investors with a better understanding while they participate in the enormous Chinese water market through the PPP mode.

1171,"Water quality and pollution in the Hunchun Basin, China Chemical properties and pollution of water resources were studied in the Hunchun basin, which is located in northeast China and borders directly North Korea and Russia along the Tumen river. Water quality was characterised according to its major constituents and geological features. Ground waters could generally be grouped into (Ca+Mg)-HCO3 type and (Ca+Mg)-(SO4+Cl) type in first and the second terrace areas, respectively. The mixing of these two types depends on the local conditions, such as pumping or permeability variations. Hunchun city is a pollution source for local water resources due to its uncontrolled sewage and urban discharge. In a previous study of the southwestern part of the Hunchun basin, groundwater contamination by Fe, Mn and NO3-N was reported. In addition, this study identified Cd and F as prevailing contaminants in the water resources. Pollution of water resources by these contaminants appeared to be affected by the application of fertilisers, irrigation practice, variation of aquifer characteristics, solubility of mineral phases, and discharge of domestic sewage. Wide distribution and high levels of Cd and F in surface- and ground waters could pose significant problems if they are utilised as major water supply sources.",1
1172,"Spatial distribution of uranium and metalloids in groundwater near sandstone-type uranium deposits, Southern Mongolia In the Dornogobi Aimag region of Southern Mongolia, the main source of groundwater contamination by U, As, and Se is hydrogenic-or sandstone-type uranium deposits. These environmentally hazardous deposits, located in close proximity to populated settlements, pose a serious threat to drinking water quality and human health. Fifty samples were analyzed and levels of uranium were found to be elevated in deep and shallow waters (200 and 34.7 mu g/L, respectively), with nearly 25% exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline level for drinking water quality (30 mu g/L). Local rocks and soils appear to be the natural source of uranium. In particular, water from deep hydrologic wells near the largest deposits (Dulaan Uul and Zoovch Ovoo) exceeds the WHO guideline levels for U, As, Se, Sb, Cd, and Fe. At the same time, shallow groundwater (Argalant area) contains 50.5 mu g/L of As, 34.7 mu g/L of U, and 35.9 mu g/L of Cd. Although multiple metal and metalloid contamination of groundwater is an issue of global concern, our understanding of the physical- chemical conditions of its accumulation is limited. This study provides a plausible explanation of the geochemical situation at the uranium Dornogobi province based on thermodynamic calculations.",1

1174,"Antioxidant System and Biomolecules Alteration in Pisum sativum under Heavy Metal Stress and Possible Alleviation by 5-Aminolevulinic Acid Environmental pollution is the most serious problem that affects crop productivity worldwide. Pisum sativum is a leguminous plant that is cultivated on a large scale in the Nile Delta of Egypt as a winter crop, and many of the cultivated fields irrigated with drainage water that contained many pollutants including heavy metals. The present research aimed to investigate the impact of Cd and Ni on the biochemical and physiological processes in P. sativum and evaluate the potential alleviation of their toxicity by 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Seedlings of P. sativum were grown in Hoagland solution treated with CdCl2 or NiCl2 for 72 h in the growth chamber. Hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, proline, phenolics, antioxidant enzymes, as well as Cd and Ni concentrations were measured at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 h. An experiment of alleviation was conducted where ALA was added to the growth solution at a concentration of 200 mu M coupled with 100 mu M of either CdCl2 or NiCl2. Hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, proline, and phenolics were induced due to the toxicity of Cd and Ni. The activities of antioxidant enzymes [NADH-oxidase (EC: 1.6.3.1), ascorbate peroxidase (EC: 1.11.1.11), glutathione reductase (EC: 1.6.4.2), superoxide dismutase (EC: 1.15.1.1), and catalase (EC: 1.11.1.6)] were induced under the treatments of both metals. On the other hand, the soluble protein decreased gradually depending upon the time of exposure to the heavy metals. The concentration of Cd and Ni in the leaves treated plants increased in time of exposure dependent manner, while their contents remained within the acceptable limits. The addition of ALA decreased the oxidative stress in treated P. sativum plants. The results revealed the significance of using ALA in the cultivation of P. sativum might improve its tolerance against heavy metal stress.",
1175,"Understanding Public Perception of and Participation in Non-Revenue Water Management in Malaysia to Support Urban Water Policy In contextualising the serious water loss, inefficient resource utilization, and ineffective water utility management in Malaysia, the objective of this study is to understand the public's perception of non-revenue water (NRW) management in order to provide policy inputs, and to determine ways to improve public participation in NRW reduction. Findings reveal that there is currently only meagre public participation in NRW management in Malaysia, with a majority of the respondents demonstrating a lack of knowledge and awareness on NRW; over-dependence on water utility and government agencies in reducing NRW rates; and failure to submit a report when a leaking pipe is noticed. Educating the public on the importance of reducing NRW and promoting public interests and concerns around water tariffs, is essential to improve NRW reductions in Malaysia. Community-led strategies to better engage the public in addressing NRW-related issues have to be enhanced. To this end, concrete policy implications derived from the findings of the study are outlined.",
1176,"Efficient removal of anionic dye (Congo red) by dialdehyde microfibrillated cellulose/chitosan composite film with significantly improved stability in dye solution A novel composite film with efficient removal of anionic dye (Congo red) was developed using chitosan and dialdehyde microfibrillated cellulose nano fibrils. Microfibrillated cellulose with three dimensional network structure was prepared from microcrystalline cellulose by high-pressure homogenization. Then it was surface modified by periodate to prepare dialdehyde microfibrillated cellulose (DAMFC). DAMFC/chitosan composite films were prepared by solvent-casting. During the compounding of DAMFC with chitosan, a Schiff base was formed through the reaction between the aldehyde groups of DAMFC and amino groups of chitosan. A giant network structure was therefore formed. The addition of DAMFC resulted in remarkably increased adsorption capacity of the chitosan material as well as drastically improved stability in dye solution. The adsorption performance was investigated with respect to pH, temperature, contact time, and the initial dye concentration. The possible adsorption mechanism was proposed. Various isotherm models have been used to fit the data, and kinetic parameters were evaluated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1177,"An integrated study on the geochemical, geophysical and geomechanical characteristics of the organic deposits (Coal and CBM) of eastern Sohagpur coalfield, India Coal mining, especially the underground mines are often encountered with several types of geological constraints, where massive-hard roof and trapped gas are the most serious threats leading to catastrophic (fatal) effects in form of roof falls, mine explosion and gas contamination. Thus, for enhancing the safety of underground coal mines, identification of aforesaid constraints during detailed exploration is very essential. The minable seams of Sohagpur Coalfield are often associated with rich Coal Bed Methane (CBM) content, which enhances their economical importance, but the gas content along with the presence of stable sandstone roof parallely induces challenges during their extraction. CBM also acts as an environmental hazard having twenty-one times more greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, the present paper attempts to investigate the depositional environment of the high-quality methane-rich sub-bituminous reserves of eastern Sohagpur Coalfield through integration of geochemical, geophysical and geomechanical analysis of the drilled boreholes along with their respective gas content. The results showed that the six major Barakar coal seams possessed nearly consistent distribution in terms of reserve distribution and chemical properties. These seams consisted of good quality reserves (Grade: G5-G8) with high heat values and organic content, and had less impurity content. These coal seams are overlain by stable roof having lower cavablity in form of thick hard medium-grained sandstone beds with moderate elasticity and strength. The seam structures showed a stable profile without any abrupt discontinuity except Bahmni-Chilpa fault in southern part of block. Some of the higher rank coal seams also contained potential CBM content. Statistical analysis was also carried out for understanding the distribution of reserve properties and monitored their interdependence using suitable fitting tools. Thus, the present study helped in summarizing different aspects related to reserve quality, roof properties and gas content for understanding the geology and working environment of coal reserves of less explored but economically important Central Indian coalfields.

1178,"Evaluating contamination impact of wastewater irrigation to soils in Zahedan, Iran With respect to water crisis, using urban wastewater to irrigate urban green spaces is an upcoming strategy. The pollution of lands irrigated with wastewater is one of the upcoming challenges. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate contamination indices of soils irrigated with wastewater. In this study, field experimental method in statistical form of totally random blocks with three reiterations for considered treatments was employed. To this end, one piece of three-hectare grass irrigated with wastewater and one piece of land irrigated with well water (control sample) were selected out of the green spaces of Zahedan refinery. Then, 30 compound samples were randomly taken from the depth of 0-50Â cm of three lands' soil. The refinery wastewater outlet and wall water were also sampled. Physicochemical and biological features of wastewater, wall water and soil samples irrigated with the refinery wastewater and well water were measured according to the standard methods. The obtained data were analyzed using MSTAT-C software. Based on the obtained results, the modified degree of contamination (mCd) of highly and lowly used elements in the considered soils in the experiment was less than 1, indicating a low-contamination status. PLI index of the mentioned elements in the surface soil of grass irrigated with wastewater was higher than 1 and by wall water was less than 1. The concentration of sulfur in surface soil of the two treatments under investigation was in a highly severe enrichment factor (EFâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50). In addition, the concentration of nitrogen, magnesium, zinc and manganese in the surface soil of palm trees and that of manganese, copper and manganese in the surface soil of the grass irrigated with wastewater had a high enrichment factor (5â€‰â‰¤â€‰EFâ€‰<â€‰25). Geoaccumulation index (I(geo)) of sulfur in the surface soil of the pieces irrigated with wall water (control) and that of potassium in the surface soil of the grass irrigated with wastewater were in no-contamination or average-contamination statuses (0â€‰<â€‰I(geo)â€‰â‰¤â€‰1). Other elements were in non-contaminated status (I(geo)â€‰â‰¤â€‰0) in terms of I(geo). The results of investigation of soil contamination indices showed that the soil contamination status of the study area due to wastewater irrigation was low to medium. Therefore, periodic and more accurate monitoring of wastewater treatment plant of Zahedan can be used from this wastewater for landscapes irrigation.",
1179,"Population of the North-Eastern States of India North-East India, comprising the seven states, has a population of over 45 million, which is 3.76 % of India's population. The overall density of population is 159 persons/km(2), though Assam, the principal state of the region, has a population density of 397 persons to a km(2). In contrast, the state of Arunachal Pradesh, occupying the foothills of the Himalayas, has an average density of 17 persons to a km(2). The distribution of population is highly irregular that reflects the sequent of occupancy, the agricultural potential of a state and the ruggedness and accessibility of the terrain. The most densely populated parts of the region are the plains of Brahmaputra and Barak, the Imphal plain in Manipur and the western part of Tripura. The mid-twentieth century was a demographic watershed in the population growth of Assam, as much as for the rest of India. While the population of Assam grew by just 55 % over a period of half a century between 1901 and 1951, the accelerated growth after 1951 resulted in a population growth of 288 % between 1951 and 2001. During the same period, the population of North-Eastern region as a whole grew four and a half times showing an increase of 350 %. The region has around 27 % indigenous people in its population, recognised by the Indian constitution as Scheduled Tribes or STs. The sex ratio of the region is 954 females per 1,000 males, slightly above the national average of 940 females per 1,000 males. The literacy rate in different states is variable, the highest being in Mizoram which has enumerated 93 % of its population as literate in contrast to Arunachal Pradesh which has recorded only 67 % of its population as literate. During the last four decades, birth as well as death rate has declined. A steep decline in birth rate has led to a decline in growth rate, despite the decrease in death rate. The highest decadal growth rate was between 1971 and 1981, but it has come down to 1.7 % in 2011, a figure that corresponds to the population growth rate for India.",
1180,"ACID MINE DRAINAGE AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE WATER RESOURCES IN THE WATERBERG COALFIELD South Africa currently ranks ninth in the world for proven coal reserves that have been estimated to last for over 200 years. Coal constitutes 77% of the primary energy needs in the country, with the Waterberg Coalfield estimated to hold about 40% of the remaining South African coal reserves. Coal deposits in the study area are largely composed of shales, mudstones, siltstones and sandstones which host coal-containing clay minerals,quartz, carbonates and sulphides; the most abundant sulphide mineral is pyrite. Once mining operations commence, the sulphide minerals are exposed to atmospheric oxygen which promotes degradation of hydrous sulphides into iron and sulphuric acid causing acid mine drainage (AMD). Acid-base accounting (BA) was used to determine the balance between the acid-producing potential (AP) and neutralising potential (NP). From the analysis the net neutralising potential (NNP) was determined to classify a sample as potentially acid-producing or non-acid producing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were used as other sources of characterisation for geological samples where the mineralogical and whole-rock analyses are determined. Acid mine drainage does not only result in the generation of acid but is accompanied by decreased pH and increased values of specific conductance, dissolved metals and sulphate. Inductively coupled plasma analysis was applied to determine the release of the heavy metals as well other constituents which can be detrimental to the environment. Samples were collected from the interburden and overburden as well as the coal seams. Acid-base accounting results show that the interburden and coal samples have the higher risk of producing acid upon oxidation when compared with overburden samples which have a higher concentration of neutralising minerals that can neutralise the acid produced through sulphide minerals as oxidation takes place. Analysis of kinetic test results indicated the long-term behaviour of different samples, with the electrical conductivity (EC) and pH changing over time. Samples with lower pH continued to produce more sulphate, while calcium continued to increase until it was depleted from the samples. The water demand will increase as mining continues in the area, with inter-catchment transfers identified to overcome local water-scarcity issues. Acid mine drainage poses a major threat to water resources, both groundwater and surface water.",
1181,"A new concept of river and lake regulation: ""Bi Dao"" The aquatic environmental regulations at home and abroad is rarely considered from the perspective of water body and water bank treatments together and coordinated economic and cultural development. To improve the environmental quality of waterfront cities and activate and revitalize their vitality in waterfront areas, it is necessary to make full use of the water system and its surrounding green space, to get through the waterfront slow-moving system, and connect various natural and human elements along the waterline. Li Xi, the Secretary of Guangdong Province, China, proposed the concept of ""Bi Dao"". ""Bi Dao"" is a comprehensive regulation concept that integrates natural elements and economic and social attributes with water as the main focus. ""Bi Dao"" is constantly evolving, innovating and enriching in practice and provides a useful tool for exploration and practice in China's environmental regulation efforts. ""Bi Dao"" will improve the quality of cities on both sides of the river or lake and lead to industry transformations and upgrades, which will promote economic and social development and improve the level of ecological civilization.",
1182,"Spatial patterns and regional differences of inequality in water resources exploitation in China Given an uneven distribution of water resources and different developing phases among the provinces in China, relatively equal water resources exploitation (WRE) at the provincial level is necessary to promote a coordinated development in the face of increasing regional differentiation. In this study, the deprivation theory is introduced to measure the inequality of the provincial WRE and the general deprivation index (GDI) of the WRE is calculated for 31 provinces in China during three periods (2006, 2011, and 2015); the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) is employed to detect the spatial patterns and the regional differences of the provincial GDI of the WRE. The spatial distribution of the inequality of WRE indicates that provinces with a low and medium GDI account for 71%-74% of all the provinces from 2006 to 2015. Provinces with a very high and very low GDI are mostly located in the frontier areas of the western region (WR) and in the well-developed eastern coastal areas respectively. The aggregation of the provincial GDI of the WRE occurs in Xinjiang and Tibet (high-high class) and in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai (low-low class) at the 5% significance level. The WR has the largest absolute inequality of WRE, followed by the central region (CR) and the eastern region (ER). A multiple regression analysis is used to explore the possible driving forces behind the inequality of WRE; the main drivers of the deprivation of WRE are the water use per 10,000 yuan of the gross domestic product, the per capita water resources, and the water use per 10,000 yuan of value added by industry; these parameters have large positive correlations with the GDI. Policies such as enhancing the inter-provincial socioeconomic and technological exchanges, proper compensation, and improving the water use efficiency would provide an equal distribution of the WRE.

1183,"Liver support therapy with molecular adsorbents recirculating system in liver failure: a summary of 252 cases from 14 centers in China BACKGROUND: A liver support therapy, named molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS), has been used for more than 700 liver failure patients in China. We made here a summary to evaluate the effects of MARS treatment in different applications with emphasis on hepatitis B virus (HBV) based liver failure. METHODS: This report analyzed data of 252 patients (mean age (44.9+/- 12.7) years) in three groups: acute severe hepatitis (ASH), subacute severe hepatitis (SSH) and chronic severe hepatitis (CSH). The largest group was CSH (156 patients, 61.9%), and 188 patients (74.6%, 188/252) were infected with HBV. RESULTS: MARS treatments were associated with significant reduction of albumin bound toxins and water-soluble toxins. Most of the patients showed a positive response with a significant improvement of multiple organ function substantiated by a significant increase in prothrombin time activity (PTA) and median arterial pressure (MAP). There was a decrease in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grade and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scale. Thirty-nine of 188 HBV patients (20.7%) dropped out of the commendatory consecutive therapy ending with lower survival of 43.6% while the rest of the 149 patients had a survival rate of 62.4%. Survival within the ASH and SSH groups were 81.2% and 75.0%, respectively. In the CSH group, end stage patients were predominant (65/151, 43%), whereas the early and middle stage patients had a better prognosis: early stage survival, including orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) survival of 91.7%, middle stage survival of 75%, end stage survival of 33.8%. CONCLUSIONS: MARS continues to be the most favorable extracorporeal treatment for liver support therapy in China for a wide range of conditions, including the majority of hepatitis B related liver failure conditions. The appropriate application of MARS for the right indications and stage of hepatic failure, as well as the fulfillment of prescribed treatments, will lead to the optimal therapeutic result.",
1184,"Reservoir Triggered Seismicity (RTS) and well water level response in the Koyna-Warna region, India Water level fluctuations in twenty-one observation wells have been monitored for the last 10 years around the seismically active Koyna-Warna region, western India where earthquakes continue to occur even after four decades of the initiation of the seismic activity in the region. Fourteen of the observation wells act as volume strain meters as their water levels show earth tidal signals. Our analysis suggests three types of response of the well water levels to seismo-tectonic effects, i) one to local earthquakes, ii) to regional and teleseismic events, and iii) to local fluctuations in rock strain on regional scale. We observed five cases of co-seismic step-like well water level changes, of the order of few centimeters in amplitude, related to earthquakes in the magnitude range 4.3 <= M <= 5.2. All these earthquakes occurred within the network of wells drilled for the study and within 25 km distance of the recording wells. In three cases, drop in well levels preceded co-seismic step-like increases, which may be of premonitory nature. The second type of response is observed to be due to the passing of seismic waves from regional and teleseismic earthquakes like the M 7.7 Bhuj event on January 26, 2001 and the M 9.3 December 26, 2004 Sumatra earthquake. The third type is a well level anomaly of centimeter amplitude coherently occurring in several wells. The anomalies are similar in shape and last for several hours to days. From our studies we conclude that the wells in the network appear to respond to regional strain variations and transient changes due to distant earthquakes. The two factors which are important to co-seismic steps due to local earthquakes are the magnitude and epicentral distance. From the limited number of events we found that all local earthquakes exceeding M ! 4.3 have produced co-seismic changes. No such changes were observed for earthquakes below this magnitude threshold.

1185,"Assessment of water quality and heavy metals in Semenyih River Semenyih River has been considered one of Malaysia's most important rivers, particularly in the Selangor Region. This river has been the primary water supply for Putrajaya's domestic and industrial activities in Sepang and Hulu Langat District. However, due to the rapid development near the Semenyih River, this stream's quality has been heavily affected. Therefore, this research aimed to determine the Water Quality Index (WQI) and heavy metals concentration in the upstream, middle stream, and downstream of the Semenyih River. The upstream is located at Peeing River Village, the middle stream situated at Semenyih Town, and downstream located at Buah River Village. The WQI set by the Department of Environmental Malaysia (DOE) has been used to classify Semenyih River. In-situ and laboratory tests were done in quantifying the WQI. Heavy metals concentration such as chromium, iron, manganese, zinc, and lead were tested for the river samples. From the results obtained, all intake points had fallen into Class III, in which extensive treatment is needed for water supply. Meanwhile, for heavy metals, the downstream sample had shown the highest concentration of heavy metals compared to the upstream and middle stream. Thus, the Semenyih River's rehabilitation is urgently required to reduce the pollution in preserving the water supply in the Selangor region.",1
1186,"Rapid and highly selective removal of lead from water using graphene oxide-hydrated manganese oxide nanocomposites To overcome the limits of graphene oxide (GO) as a novel sorbent for heavy metal removal (e.g., low sorption selectivity and difficulty in solid-liquid separation), a nanocomposite (HMO@GO) with excellent settling ability (<2 min) was fabricated through in situ growing nanosized hydrated manganese oxide (HMO) (10.8 +/- 4.1 nm) on GO. As a graphene-based adsorbent, HMO@GO exhibited fast sorption kinetics (<20 min). Meanwhile, the introduced HMO endowed HMO@GO with outstanding sorption selectivity and capacity toward Pb(II) (>500 mg g(-1)) in the presence of high-level competing Ca(II). Cyclic sorption batches showed that 1 kg HMO@GO can treat at least 22 m(3) Pb(II)-laden synthetic industrial drainage (5 mg L-1 Pb(II)) and 40 m(3) drinking water (0.5 mg L-1 Pb(II)) to their corresponding limits (0.1 mg L-1 for wastewater and 10 mu g L-1 for drinking water) enforced in China. Additionally, the exhausted HMO@GO can be effectively regenerated using 0.3 M HCI for repeated uses. The eminent performance of HMO@GO was attributed to its specific structure, that is, the abundant oxygen-containing groups on GO mediated the growth of highly dispersed HMO that preferably sequestrated Pb(II) through specific interaction, and the host GO offered the preconcentration of Pb(II) for enhanced sequestration through the Donnan membrane effect.

1187,"Exercising the right to access adequate housing in Joe Morolong Local Municipality, Rural South Africa Among the rights in the Bill of Rights contained in the South African Constitution is the right to access adequate housing. This right is bound up with other rights in the Constitution, including the right to have human dignity respected, and the right to, inter alia water and health care. The right to adequate housing is also included in several international human rights declarations including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. However, the right to access adequate housing is more than just shelter but includes a number of other elements such as security of tenure, and access to basic services and facilities. Housing must be affordable and accessible. It must be safe and habitable and be culturally acceptable. Moreover, adequate housing is well located with respect to economic and other opportunities. The provision of housing and basic services has been the focus of the ANC-led government since 1994, and a major portion of municipal resources has been dedicated to providing water and sanitation to particularly the poorest households, while over 4.3 million state-subsidized housing opportunities have been delivered. whereas the scale of delivery has been impressive, has it really impacted on the lives of people in remote communities? Research conducted in the Joe Morolong Municipality in the Northern Cape Province regarding the realization of the right to access adequate housing reveals that the right to adequate housing has at best, only been partially realized. In addition to interviews with office bearers and municipal officials, 120 households were interviewed (of which half were from self-built houses and half were residing in ""RDP"" houses) regarding their interpretation and experience of the right to access adequate housing in the municipality. The study reveals that the structures do not meet the criteria for adequate housing and the provision of water and sanitation remains a challenge. Access to health and education facilities is poor, due to the low densities and vast distances between settlements.",
1188,"EFFECTIVENESS OF THE APPLICATION OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA FUNGI AND ORGANIC AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE SOIL QUALITY AND PLANT PERFORMANCE UNDER STRESS CONDITIONS Plant growth is limited in arid and/or contaminated sites due to the adverse conditions coming from heavy metal (HM) contamination and/or water stress. Moreover, soils from these areas are generally characterised by poor soil structure, low water-holding capacity, lack of organic matter and nutrient deficiency. In order to carry out a successful re-afforestation, it is necessary to improve soil quality and the ability of plants species to resist this harsh environment. The symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi has been proposed as one of the mechanisms of plant heavy metal tolerance and water stress avoidance. On the other hand, addition of organic amendments to the soil can reverse degradation of soil properties. Agro-waste residues such as dry olive cake (DOC) and sugar beet waste (SB) supplemented with rock phosphate (RP) can be used as organic amendments after fermentation by Aspergillus niger. The application of A. niger- treated DOC and/or SB to semi-arid soils and/or HM-contaminated soils increased aggregate stability, soil enzymatic activities, water soluble C and water soluble carbohydrates as well as nutrient availability, especially P. AM inoculation, using adapted endophytes, was more efficient with respect to increasing plant nutrition and growth as well as plant tolerance to drought or HM-stress conditions. The combined treatments involving mycorrhiza fungi inoculation and addition of the amendments into the soil can be proposed as a successful revegetation strategy for plant performance in P-deficient soils under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. The beneficial effectiveness of this symbiosis with suitable AM fungi in A. niger-treated agro-waste residue-amended soil can also be regarded as a successful biotechnological tool for reclamation of HM-contaminated soils.",
1189,"Radiation Synthesis of Novel Hydrogel Based on Wheat flour for Dyes Removal A novel hydrogel based on wheat flour (F) and acrylic acid (AAc) was performed by gamma irradiation. The parameters that controlled the preparation conditions were studied including irradiation dose and hydrogel composition. Characterization of the produced hydrogel (F/AAc) was done by infrared spectroscopy to confirm the structure and the change in morphology was investigated by the scanning electron microscope. The thermal stability was also investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The swelling properties were investigated in relation to time and irradiation dose. The developed hydrogel was used for the removal of Congo Red dye (CR) from aqueous solution. Effects of different operating parameters such as effect of pH, contact time, concentration of the dye and temperature on the adsorption capacity of the dye have been studied. It was found that marvelous adsorption capacities were obtained at pH 3. The adsorption capacity at pH 3 is 19.5 mg/g for (F/AAc) hydrogel contains (15wt% AAc) at 2.5 kGy, 17.3mg/g for (F/AAc) hydrogel contains (15wt% AAc) at 20 kGy, and 13.4 mg/g for (F/AAc) hydrogel contains (20 wt% AAc) at 20 kGy.

1190,"Responses of rainwater conservation, precipitation-use efficiency and grain yield of summer maize to a furrow-planting and straw-mulching system in northern China In the rain-fed areas of northern China, maize (Zea mays L.) is a main field crop, as it is well adapted to high temperatures and bright sunshine. However, low and variable rainfall and high evapotranspiration rates are common in water-limited environments during the growing season, and often mismatched rainfall events with the critical growth stages, making yield unstable. In this study, the performance of a furrow-planting and straw-mulching system was compared with the conventional flat-planting system in a double-crop culture of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize for two consecutive years (2005-2006 and 2006-2007). The four tested treatments were: conventional flat planting (F), furrow planting between ridges (B), flat planting with wheat straw-mulching (FS), and furrow planting between ridges with wheat-straw mulch (BS). Soil water content and leaf area index (LAI) were measured throughout the growing season each year, and grain yield and precipitation-use efficiency (PUEY) were determined. On average, ridge tillage combined with furrow planting increased maize yield by 430 kg ha(-1) (7.3%) and PUEY by 10.7% (1.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)), compared with the conventional flat planting; furrow planting coupled with straw mulching increased yield by an additional 16.9% and PUEY by 19.4%, respectively. From jointing to maturity, LAI values of BS were significantly higher than those of F-system (55.6% vs. 26.1% in 2006 and 81.4% vs. 21.7% in 2007). Our data suggest that maize production adopted by furrow planting with straw-covered ridges performed best under seasonal average rainfall below 480 mm, which was associated with better synchronization of seasonal soil water supply and crop needs, leading to improved maize yield and PUEY.

1191,"The effective radium content and radon concentrations in coffee samples Background: Many people in Iraq and indeed the world choose to drink coffee on a daily basis; accordingly, we planned to find the radium and uranium concentrations in addition to the Radon emission rate to determine if coffee shows the levels of radioactivity that may affect people's lives. Material and Methods: A nuclear track detector (CR-39) was used to study the natural radioactivity of ten samples of coffee collected from local Iraqi markets. Results: The effective radium content varied from 0.13 to 0.66 Bq/kg with a mean 0.32 Bq/kg. The mass exhalation rates of radon vary from 0.024 - 0.121/kg.h, with a mean 0.059 Bq/kg.h, while the surface exhalation rates of radon vary from 0.47 - 2.39/m(2).h, with a mean 1.16 Bq/m(2).h. Uranium content varied from 0.10 to 0.54 ppm with a mean value of 0.26 ppm. Conclusion: Insofar as health effects are concerned, the results have shown that all the samples were entirely safe.",
1192,"Comparison of Biomasses of Different Plants for Phytoremediation of Arsenic The removal of heavy metals from drinking water, lake and waste water is crucial issue concern to health. The brake fern, Pteris vittata, is claimed to be the first found to function as an arsenic hyper accumulator. Phytoremediation by water hyacinth presents a potential solution to the arsenic problem. In the present study three plants (Calotropis procera, Eichhoenia crassipes and Pieris vittata) biomasses are selected and there arial parts and roots (dry biomasses) are compared for the first time. Also these plants are checked for the presence of other metals. After the removal of metal the treated water is then checked for the drinking water parameters. It was found that roots of Calotropis procera are best of biomasses selected for the phytoremediation of arsenic. The capacity of removal of Calotropis roots was also determined. After treatment water samples meet all EPA standards for drinking water.",
1193,"Antibiotic resistome in a large urban-lake drinking water source in middle China: Dissemination mechanisms and risk assessment The increasing pollution of urban drinking water sources by antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) threatens human health worldwide. However, the distribution and influencing factors of ARGs, especially how to reveal the risks of ARGs in this environment remains unclear. Hence, Chaohu Lake was selected as an example to investigate the characteristics of ARGs and explore the interactions among physicochemical factors, microorganisms, and ARGs by metagenomic approach. In this work, 75 ARG subtypes with an average of 30.4Â Ã—Â /Gb (ranging from 15.2Â Ã—/Gb to 57.9Â Ã—/Gb) were identified, and multidrug and bacA were most frequent in Chaohu Lake. Non-random co-occurrence patterns and potential host bacteria of ARGs were revealed through co-occurrence networks. Microbial community and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were the major direct factors in ARG profiles. The dissemination of ARGs was mainly driven by plasmids. Considering the interactions among MGEs, human bacterial pathogens, and ARGs, antibiotic resistome risk index (ARRI) was proposed to manifest the risks of ARGs. Overall, our work systemically investigated the composition and associated factors of ARGs and built ARRI to estimate the potential risks of ARGs in a typical urban drinking water source, providing an intuitive indicator for managing similar lakes.",
1194,"Prosper, survive or exit: Contrasted fortunes of farmers in the groundwater economy in the Saiss plain (Morocco) In North Africa, the development of groundwater-based irrigation enabled agricultural intensification and market-oriented production. Groundwater use was also often said to alleviate smallholder poverty. However, there is growing evidence linking the expansion of groundwater-based agriculture with increasing socioeconomic inequalities in a context of declining water tables and rapid agrarian change. This paper analyzes the contrasted fortunes of different categories of farmers participating in the groundwater economy, depending on access to other resources including land, capital and labor. The study was conducted in a 3910 ha area in the Saiss plain (Morocco), where rapid agrarian transformations took place with the arrival of investors attracted by state subsidies and the possibility to carry out intensive groundwater-based agriculture. The study began with interviews with key informants to determine the role of groundwater use in farm trajectories. Then, an inventory was undertaken of all farms and of all wells and tube-wells in the study area. Next, the groundwater use per farm type was determined on a sample of 24 farms. Finally, the socioeconomic differentiation of farms was determined, based on the inequalities in access to groundwater, land, labor and financial capital. The results revealed contrasted fortunes of farmers involved in the groundwater economy. The boom in the groundwater economy benefitted entrepreneurial and well-endowed farmers who made intensive use of groundwater, while the effects of their overexploitation of groundwater fed the marginalization of family farmers. The results show that capital has replaced landownership as the dominant production factor, thereby re-qualifying what is a 'small' farmer. Capital is not only required to obtain access to groundwater, but also to deal with the more risky agriculture frequently conducted in the groundwater economy. This leads to the exclusion of small family farmers who may quit the groundwater economy poorer than they entered it. The urgent need to control access to and use of groundwater in the face of declining water tables has little chance of producing results if socioeconomic inequalities remain unaddressed.

1195,"Ecosystem Services Assessment, Trade-Off, and Bundles in the Yellow River Basin, China Understanding ecosystem services(ESs)and their interactions will help to formulate effective and sustainable land use management plans, and clarifying the balance and synergy between watershed ecosystem services can provide a basis for the regulation of the ecological environment in different regions of the watershed and the maximization of overall ecological benefits. This paper takes the Yellow River Basin as the research object and uses the Ecosystem Services and Trade Offs (InVEST)model to evaluate the water yield (WY), soil conservation (SC), carbon storage (CS) and habitat quality (HQ) of the Yellow River Basin. The paper adopts the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA)model to evaluate the net primary productivity (NPP), draws the spatial distribution map of the five ecosystems, analyzes the trade-off and synergy between the five ecosystems using correlation and binary spatial correlation, and expresses it in space. In addition, it adopts self-organizing mapping (SOM) method to identify ecosystem service clusters. The results show that: (1) ES is generally higher in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and lower in the middle reaches. (2) WY and NPP, HQ, CS and WY are trade-off relationships, and other ecosystem services are synergistic relationships. Trade-offs and synergy show obvious spatial heterogeneity. (3) The ecosystem services of the Yellow River Basin, driven by different factors, can be divided into three areas, namely WY and SC service leading functional areas, HQ and CS service leading functional areas, and NPP service leading functional areas. Finally, it discusses the driving factors of the spatial heterogeneity of the balance of the ecosystem service functions of the Yellow River Basin and the suggestions of land use management in the basin.",
1196,"Statistical Analysis of Fluoride Levels in Human Urine and Drinking Water Samples of Fluorinated Area of Punjab (Pakistan) Increasing fluoride levels in drinking water of fluorinated areas of world leading to fluorosis. For bio-monitoring of fluorosis patients, fluoride levels were determined in drinking water and human urine samples of different individuals having dental fluorosis and bony deformities from fluorotic area of Punjab (Sham Ki Bhatiyan, Pakistan) and then compared with reference samples of non fluorotic area (Queens Road, Lahore, Pakistan) using ion selective electrode methodology. Fluoride levels in fluorinated area differ significantly from control group (p < 0.05). In drinking water and human urine samples, fluoride levels in fluorinated areas were: 136.192 +/- 67.836 and 94.484 +/- 36.572 mu molL(-1) respectively, whereas in control samples, fluoride concentrations were: 19.306 +/- 2.109 and 47.154 +/- 22.685 mu molL(-1) in water and urine samples correspondingly. Pearson's correlation data pointed out the fact that that human urine and water fluoride concentrations have a significant positive dose response relationship with the prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis in fluorotic areas having higher fluoride levels in drinking water.",
1197,"Arsenic exposure and impaired lung function. Findings from a large population-based prospective cohort study RATIONALE: Exposure to arsenic through drinking water has been linked to respiratory symptoms, obstructive lung diseases, and mortality from respiratory diseases. Limited evidence for the deleterious effects on lung function exists among individuals exposed to a high dose of arsenic. OBJECTIVES: To determine the deleterious effects on lung function that exist among individuals exposed to a high dose of arsenic. METHODS: In 950 individuals who presented with any respiratory symptom among a population-based cohort of 20,033 adults, we evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, measured by well water and urinary arsenic concentrations measured at baseline, and post-bronchodilator-administered pulmonary function assessed during follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For every one SD increase in baseline water arsenic exposure, we observed a lower level of FEV1 (-46.5 ml; P < 0.0005) and FVC (-53.1 ml; P < 0.01) in regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, betel nut use, and arsenical skin lesions status. Similar inverse relationships were observed between baseline urinary arsenic and FEV1 (-48.3 ml; P < 0.005) and FVC (-55.2 ml; P < 0.01) in adjusted models. Our analyses also demonstrated a dose-related decrease in lung function with increasing levels of baseline water and urinary arsenic. This association remained significant in never-smokers and individuals without skin lesions, and was stronger in male smokers. Among male smokers and individuals with skin lesions, every one SD increase in water arsenic was related to a significant reduction of FEV1 (-74.4 ml, P < 0.01; and -116.1 ml, P < 0.05) and FVC (-72.8 ml, P = 0.02; and -146.9 ml, P = 0.004), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This large population-based study confirms that arsenic exposure is associated with impaired lung function and the deleterious effect is evident at low- to moderate-dose range.",1
1198,"Toxicological responses of environmental mixtures: Environmental metal mixtures display synergistic induction of metal-responsive and oxidative stress genes in placental cells Exposure to elevated levels of the toxic metals inorganic arsenic (iAs) and cadmium (Cd) represents a major global health problem. These metals often occur as mixtures in the environment, creating the potential for interactive or synergistic biological effects different from those observed in single exposure conditions. In the present study, environmental mixtures collected from two waste sites in China and comparable mixtures prepared in the laboratory were tested for toxicogenomic response in placental JEG-3 cells. These cells serve as a model for evaluating cellular responses to exposures during pregnancy. One of the mixtures was predominated by iAs and one by Cd. Six gene biomarkers were measured in order to evaluate the effects from the metal mixtures using dose and time-course experiments including: heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and metallothionein isoforms (MT1A, MT1F and MT1G) previously shown to be preferentially induced by exposure to either iAs or Cd, and metal transporter genes aquaporin-9 (AQP9) and ATPase, Cu2+ transporting, beta polypeptide (ATP7B). There was a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of ATP7B, HO-1, MT1A, MT1F, and MT1G in mixture-treated cells compared to the iAs or Cd only-treated cells. Notably, the genomic responses were observed at concentrations significantly lower than levels found at the environmental collection sites. These data demonstrate that metal mixtures increase the expression of gene biomarkers in placental JEG-3 cells in a synergistic manner. Taken together, the data suggest that toxic metals that co-occur may induce detrimental health effects that are currently underestimated when analyzed as single metals.

1199,"New dimensions in Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM's) Tunnelling dates back to prehistoric times, Primitive people made cavities or widened the natural caves for shelter against weather, enemies and wild life. Archaeological research establishes that men even in the stone age excavated cavities. History reveals that about 4000 years back, Queen Semiramis of Babylon constructed an underground tunnel about 1 km long, 10 ft diameter under the bed of the River Euphrates to establish underground traffic between the palace and the Temple of Jove. Roman and Greek warriors dug tunnels to demolish forts and undermine or underpass the fortifications. About 700 BC the King of Judea built a water tunnel about 200 m long to feed the town. Vey old tunnels built several thousand of years ago have been found in Egypt, India, Mexico and Peru. Man's insatiable passion to achieve more and more progress and production to meet the ever increasing requirement of mankind has driven him to design and improve upon the production of basic tunnelling tools into more efficient and productive ones. In the last two decades or so, conventional tunelling equipment like drill machines, drill bits and drill rods, ventilation system, muck loading and handling equipment. rail mounted as well as tyred, Hydraulic-Micro-Computer-Controlled two boom and three boom tunnel jumbos fitted with automatic mechanism stopping the drill on completion of the hole and micro-processor contol enabling the operator to spend more time in monitoring performance with position of the booms, drilling penetration and the drill penetration rate unit, computerised short-creting and-rock bolting are some of the hallmarks of recent innovations which have enabled us to achieve spectacular progress in the technique of conventional method of tunnelling. Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) or ""MOLE'S"" as popularly known in the construction industry, have since 1851 when the first continuous tunnel borer was developed in America, to date, have undergone tremendous changes in order not only to beat the productive capacities of conventional equipment but also to make their application more versatile and flexible to successfully face the ever-changing and quite often unpredictable geological formations of the rock mass. Significant developments in the design of configuration of cutter heads, their metallurgy, their spacing and size and other features in the last 20 years or so have made the borers more versatile and adaptable to a variety of rocks-hard and sound, faily good rock, poor rock including ""squeezing"" are some of the amazing Features which have been innovated and implemented by the engineers in the recent past. These and other highly efficient and productive features based on extensive research and experience have enabled the TBM's to achieve fantastic progress both in terms of size and advance. This article ""New Dimensions in Tunnel Boring Machines"" attempts to discuss these and other features more in detail and also the application of various types of borers compatible with the geological formations to be encountered. This also attempts to highlight he latest ""Fluid Balance"" system (FBS), developed by Robbins Co.

1200,"The effect of arsenite on denitrification using volatile fatty acids (VFAs) as a carbon source A lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated at a solids retention time (SRT) of 20 +/- 2.5 days to develop a consortium of denitrifying bacteria with a mean specific denitrification rate of 0.11 g nitrate (NO(3)(-)-N)/g volatile suspended solids (VSS)/day. This biomass was used in a series of denitrification batch tests which used volatile fatty acids (VFAs) as their external carbon source. The VFAs were generated from an anaerobic digester that had an effluent VFA concentration of 5655 +/- 876 mg/L (expressed as acetic acid (HAc)). The denitrification batch reactors were spiked with NO(3)(-)-N (carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio of 3.0) and different concentrations of arsenite (a trivalent arsenic salt) in order to quantify the effect of arsenite on the denitrification process. A steady deterioration in the ability of the biomass to denitrify under increasing arsenite concentrations was observed with the mean specific denitrification rate dropping from 0.183 g NO(3)(-)-N/gVSS/day at an arsenite concentration of 5 mg/L, to a value of 0.047 g NO(3)(-)-N/gVSS/day at a concentration of 25 mg/L.",
1201,"Geochemical and microbial characteristics of seepage water and mineral precipitates in a radwaste disposal facility impacted by seawater intrusion and high alkalinity The construction of an underground facility can dramatically change the quality, flow direction, and level of groundwater. It may also impact subsurface microbial composition and activity. Groundwater quality was monitored over eight years in two observational wells near an underground disposal facility on the east coast of South Korea. The results showed dramatic increases in dissolved ions such as O(2), Na, Ca, Mg, and SO(4) during facility construction. Seepage water samples downgradient from the silos and tunnels, and precipitates deposited along the seepage water flow path were collected to determine the impact inside the disposal facility. X-ray analysis (powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS)) were used to characterize the mineral precipitates. Microbial community composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The seepage water composition was of two types: Ca-Cl and Ca-Na-HCO(3). The ratio of Cl and Î´(18)O showed that the Ca-Cl type seepage water was influenced by groundwater mixed with seawater ranging from 2.7% to 15.1%. Various sulfate-reducing bacteria were identified in the Ca-Cl type seepage water, exhibiting relatively high sulfate content from seawater intrusion. Samples from the Ca-Na-HCO(3) type seepage water had an extremely high pH (>10) and abundance of Hydrogenophaga. The precipitates observed along the flow path of the seepage water included calcite, ferrihydrite, green rust, and siderite, depending on seepage water chemistry and microbial activity. This study suggests that the construction of underground structures creates distinct, localized geochemical conditions (e.g., high alkalinity, high salinity, and oxic conditions), which may impact microbial communities. These biogeochemical changes may have undesirable large-scale impacts such as water pump clogging. An understanding of the process and long-term monitoring are essential to assess the safety of underground facilities.",
1202,"Towards a low cost lead assay technique for drinking water using CMOS sensors An estimated 26 million people in low-and middle-income countries are at risk of lead exposure and there is no safe threshold for lead ingestion. Radio assay methods are not easily accessible in regions at risk, therefore a low cost and easy to use sensor is desirable. Pb occurs together with traces of radioisotopes with decay energies in the range of 10 to several 100keV and beyond. Such energies are accessible in silicon sensors. We have tested a scientific CMOS (Neo 5.5 sCMOS), optimised for optical wavelengths, as Î³ detector for radiation in the range of 0 to a few 10keV. We find a minimal detectable 241Am decay rate of 20Bq for a â‰¤1.4h measurement. Optimising our analysis software will potentially enable detecting lower rates in the same measurement time. We established that the Neo 5.5 sCMOS allows to measure a spectrum of 241Am decay lines. In addition we show that it is possible to enhance the concentration of radioisotopes in water when reducing the water's volume by boiling. The knowledge gained using the scientific CMOS sensor will be transferred to commercial silicon sensors as the chips in smart phones. Â© 2019 IEEE.",
1203,"Regional patterns in the geochemistry of oil-field water, southern San Joaquin Valley, California, USA Chemical and isotopic data for water co-extracted with hydrocarbons in oil and gas fields are commonly used to examine the source of the formation water and possible impacts on groundwater in areas of oil and gas development. Understanding the geochemical variability of oil-field water could help to evaluate its origin and delineate possible contamination of shallow aquifers in cases where oil-field water is released to the environment. Here we report geochemical and multiple isotope (H, C, O, Sr, Ra) data from 22 oil wells, three sources of produced water that are disposed of in injection wells, and two surface disposal ponds in four oil fields in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California (Fruitvale, Lost Hills, North and South Belridge). Correlations between Cl and delta O-18, as well as other ions, and gradual increases in salinity with depth, indicate dilution of one or more saline end-members by meteoric water. The saline end-members, represented by deep samples (610 m-2621 m) in three oil-bearing zones, are characterized by Na-Cl composition, near-seawater Cl concentrations (median 20,000 mg/L), enriched delta O-18-H2O (median 3.4 parts per thousand), high ammonium (up to 460 mg-N/L), and relatively high radium activity (Ra-226+Ra-228 = 12.3 Bq/L). The deepest sample has low Na/Cl (0.74), high Ca/Mg (5.0), and low Sr-87/Sr-86 (similar to 0.7063), whereas the shallower samples have higher Na/Cl (0.86-1.2), Ca/Mg near 1, and higher Sr-87/Sr-86(similar to 0.7083). The data are consistent with an original seawater source being modified by various depth and lithology dependent diagenetic processes. Dilution by meteoric water occurs naturally on the east side of the valley, and in association with water-injection activities on the west side. Meteoric-water flushing, particularly on the east side, results in lower solute concentrations (minimum total dissolved solids 2730 mg/L) and total radium (minimum 0.27 Bq/L) in oil-field water, and promotes biodegradation of dissolved organic carbon and hydrocarbon gases like propane. Acetate concentrations and delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon indicate biogenic methane production occurs in some shallow oil zones. Natural and human processes produce substantial variability in the geochemistry of oil-field water that should be considered when evaluating mixing between oilfield waters and groundwater. The variability could result in uncertainty as to detecting the potential source and impact of oil-field water on groundwater.",
1204,"A review of 17Î±-ethynylestradiol (EE2) in surface water across 32 countries: Sources, concentrations, and potential estrogenic effects 17Î±-ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a synthetic estrogen with very strong estrogenic potency. Due to its wide usage in human and livestock as well as its high recalcitration to biodegradation, it was ubiquitous in different environment. This review summarized EE2 concentration levels in surface waters among 32 countries across seven continents. EE2 concentrations varied greatly in different surface waters, which ranged from not detected to 17,112Â ng/L. The top 10 countries ranked in the order of high to low average EE2 concentration in surface water, were Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Laos, Brazil, Argentina, Kuwait, Thailand, Indonesia and Portugal, with the respective mean concentrations of 27.7, 22.1, 21.5, 21.1, 13.6, 9.6, 9.5, 8.8, 7.6 and 6.6Â ng/L. Generally speaking, the EE2 concentration levels in surface waters in developing countries were much higher than those in developed countries. EE2 in effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was the dominant source to most countries, which suggested that improving the EE2 removal performance of municipal WWTP is the key to mitigate EE2 contamination to surface water body. Livestock, hospital, pharmacy factory and aquaculture wastewaters were also the important sources, but further work should be performed to elucidate their contribution. Evaluation based on estrogenic effects, the EE2-derived estrogen equivalence in surface waters ranged from 0 to 33Â ng E2/L, among which about 65% of surface waters among 32 countries were at risk or high risk, indicating global serious EE2 contamination. MAIN FINDING: EE2 concentration in surface waters across 32 countries were summarized, along which its potential estrogenic effects were evaluated.",
1205,"Geoelectrical study of corrosivity and competence of soils within Uburu and Okposi areas of Ebonyi State, Southeastern Nigeria Purpose The corrosivity and competence of soils within Uburu and Okposi areas of the Southern Benue Trough, Nigeria, were evaluated using the electrical resistivity method. This paper aims to provide information that will aid pre-design of subsurface iron/steel pipe networks for distribution of pipe-borne water and construction of subsurface structures for agricultural and environmental purposes. Design/methodology/approach In total, 22 vertical electrical soundings (VES) in the Schlumberger configuration were acquired with Allied Ohmega Terrameter with a maximum half current (AB/2) electrode spacing of 200 m. Layer parameters were determined using partial curve matching techniques, using the Schlumberger master curves, while processing and modelling were done with the IPI2win software. The VES results were interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively to obtain various curve types and layer parameters, respectively, which were used to categorize the area into different competence and corrosivity zones. The first layer isoresistivity and competence maps were used to delineate four zones (A,B,C and D) with varying apparent resistivities and competences. Findings Incompetent soils with resistivity values ranging from 24.3-88.7 Om are found in Zone A. The soils in Zone A are mainly expansive clays which swell on absorption of water. Zone B contains moderately competent soils with resistivity values ranging from 273-308.6 Om, while Zones C and D are underlain by sandstones and contain competent to highly competent soils with resistivity values ranging from 511-750 Om and 835-1,525 Om, respectively. Zone E contains highly corrosive (24.3 Om) to mildly corrosive (102 Om) soils; Zone F contains soils that are essentially non-corrosive with resistivity values ranging from 271-1,525 Om, while the corrosivity of soils within Zone G varies from corrosive to mildly corrosive, with resistivity values ranging from 44.3-114 Om. Research limitations/implications Some of the areas are not accessible because of community restrictions. Practical implications These findings are essentially very significant and should be taken into consideration when materials that are susceptible to corrosion are being considered for engineering, agricultural and environmental purposes in the area. Social implications The findings will aid water resource planners and developers on how to protect metal pipes from corrosion, when used for water reticulation and agricultural purposes. Originality/value This paper fulfils an identified need to study the corrosivity of soils in the study area with a view to providing adequate protection to metal objects when being considered for water reticulation for domestic and agricultural purposes in the area.",
1206,"Adsorption of Toxic Metals on Modified Polyacrylonitrile Nanofibres: A Review Removal of toxic metals from aqueous solutions is of high priority in environmental chemistry. Most of the available techniques for this task are considered expensive; however, the adsorption process has been considered the easiest and the cheapest way of removing toxic metals from aqueous solution. The performance of adsorption setup largely depends on the characteristic of adsorbents. One of these characteristic is availability of large surface area. The more the available sites for chelation, the more the amount of metals removed. Therefore, the production of materials of nanoscale is expedient for adsorption purposes. Electrospinning process is one of the technologies that have been employed to produce polyacrylonitrile nanofibres (PAN-nfs). Moreover, PAN-nfs surfaces have also been chemically modified so as to introduce chelating groups such as amine, carboxyl, imines, etc. Here we review PAN-nfs as metal ion adsorbent. With characteristics such as high surface area as well as good mechanical strength, modified PAN-nfs are considered good adsorbents and have been used to remove toxic metals such as cadmium, lead, chromium, mercury, uranium, silver and copper in different ion states from their aqueous solutions. The ease of immobilization of metal-specific ligands on PAN-nfs has been of great interest in selective extraction of metal ions from their aqueous solutions. Also, toxic metals adsorbed on modified PAN-nfs can be recovered through desorption process using acids or bases of various concentrations.",
1207,"Isotopic fractionation of Cu in tektites Tektites are terrestrial natural glasses of up to a few centimeters in size that were produced during hypervelocity impacts on the Earth's surface. It is well established that the chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is generally identical to that of the upper terrestrial continental crust. Tektites typically have very low water content, which has generally been explained by volatilization at high temperature; however, the exact mechanism is still debated. Because volatilization can fractionate isotopes, comparing the isotopic composition of volatile elements in tektites with those of their source rocks may help to understand the physical conditions during tektite formation. Interestingly, volatile chalcophile elements (e.g., Cd and Zn) seem to be the only elements for which isotopic fractionation is known so far in tektites. Here, we extend this study to Cu, another volatile chalcophile element. We have measured the Cu isotopic composition for 20 tektite samples from the four known different strewn fields. All of the tektites (except the Muong Nong-types) are enriched in the heavy isotopes of Cu (1.98 < delta Cu-61 < 6.99) in comparison to the terrestrial crust (delta Cu-65 approximate to 0) with no clear distinction between the different groups. The Muong Nong-type tektites and a Libyan Desert Glass sample are not fractionated, (delta Cu-65 approximate to 0) in comparison to the terrestrial crust. To refine the Cu isotopic composition of the terrestrial crust, we also present data for three geological reference materials (delta Cu-65 approximate to 0). An increase of delta Cu-65 with decreasing Cu abundance probably reflects that the isotopic fractionation occurred by evaporation during heating. A simple Rayleigh distillation cannot explain the Cu isotopic data and we suggest that the isotopic fractionation is governed by a diffusion-limited regime. Copper is isotopically more fractionated than the more volatile element Zn (delta Zn-66/64 up to 2.49 parts per thousand). This difference of behavior between Cu and Zn is predicted in a diffusion-limited regime, where the magnitude of the isotopic fractionation is regulated by the competition between the evaporative flux and the diffusive flux at the diffusion boundary layer. Due to the difference of ionic charge in silicates (Zn2+ vs. Cu+), Cu has a diffusion coefficient that is larger than that of Zn by at least two orders of magnitude. Therefore, the larger isotopic fractionation in Cu than in Zn in tektites is due to the significant difference in their respective chemical diffusivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1208,"A new route to fabricate high-efficient porous silicate adsorbents by simultaneous inorganic-organic functionalization of low-grade palygorskite clay for removal of Congo red A series of porous quatemized silicate (QS) adsorbents with superior adsorption capabilities for anionic dye Congo Red (CR) were prepared by synchronous inorganic and organic functionalization of natural low-grade palygorskite (Pal) via a facile one-pot hydrothermal process. The Pal and its associated minerals were restructured as new porous silicate adsorbents under the action of the inorganic salts of sodium silicate and magnesium sulfate, and simultaneously the quaternary ammonium groups were in-situ introduced into the silicates using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) as donors of quatemary ammonium groups. The adsorption capacities of the QS adsorbents enhanced as the increment of quatemization degree until equilibrium is reached. The silicate adsorbents with the organification degree of 16.46% (for CTA-QS-1.2) and 13.32% (for DTA-QS-1.2) showed the best adsorption capacities of 664.29 +/- 3.92 mg/g and 684.01 +/- 8.50 mg/g for CR, respectively, which are far away higher than that of raw Pal (51.22 +/- 2.85 mg/g), the magnesium silicate adsorbents without quatemization (78.69 +/- 0.54 mg/g), and the CTAB-modified Pal prepared by commonly used method (145.10 +/- 3.61 mg/g). The fitting results of thermodynamics and kinetic models revealed that the adsorption process of the silicate adsorbents for CR obeys Freundlich and pseudo-second-order models very well, which suggests a chemical interaction and multilayer adsorption mechanism. In addition, the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen-bonding interaction contribute more to the adsorption capability than specific surface area. This paper provides a new route to fabricate high-efficient silicate adsorbent by restructure of naturally abundant low-cost Pal clay for deep decontamination of anionic dye-polluted water.",
1209,"Long Wave Resonance in Tropical Oceans and Implications on Climate: the Atlantic Ocean Based on the well established importance of long, non-dispersive baroclinic Kelvin and Rossby waves, a resonance of tropical planetary waves is demonstrated. Three main basin modes are highlighted through joint wavelet analyses of sea surface height (SSH) and surface current velocity (SCV), scale-averaged over relevant bands to address the co-variability of variables: (1) a 1-year period quasi-stationary wave (QSW) formed from gravest mode baroclinic planetary waves which consists of a northern, an equatorial and a southern antinode, and a major node off the South American coast that straddles the north equatorial current (NEC) and the north equatorial counter current (NECC), (2) a half-a-year period harmonic, (3) an 8-year sub-harmonic. Contrary to what is commonly accepted, the 1-year period QSW is not composed of wind-generated Kelvin and Rossby beams but results from the excitation of a tuned basin mode. Trade winds sustain a free tropical basin mode, the natural frequency of which is tuned to synchronize the excitation and the ridge of the QSWs. The functioning of the 1-year period basin mode is confirmed by solving the momentum equations, expanding in terms of Fourier series both the coefficients and the forcing terms. The terms of Fourier series have singularities, highlighting resonances and the relation between the resonance frequency and the wavenumbers. This ill-posed problem is regularized by considering Rayleigh friction. The waves are supposed to be semi-infinite, i.e. they do not reflect at the western and eastern boundaries of the basin, which would assume the waves vanish at these boundaries. At the western boundary the equatorial Rossby wave is deflected towards the northern antinode while forming the NECC that induces a positive Doppler-shifted wavenumber. At the eastern boundary, the Kelvin wave splits into coastal Kelvin waves that flow mainly southward to leave the Gulf of Guinea. In turn, off-tropical waves extend as an equatorially trapped Kelvin wave, being deflected off the western boundary. The succession of warm and cold waters transferred by baroclinic waves during a cycle leaves the tropical ocean by radiation and contributes to western boundary currents. The main manifestation of the basin modes concerns the variability of the NECC, of the branch of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) along the equator, of the western boundary currents as well as the formation of remote resonances, as will be presented in a future work. Remote resonances occur at midlatitudes, the role of which is suspected of being crucial in the functioning of subtropical gyres and in climate variability.",
1210,"Assessment of spring water microbiology and role of Typha angustata as biosorbent More than 2.1 billion people worldwide are deprived of safe drinking water at homes. The situation is strikingly worse in a developing country like Pakistan where over 69% of the population does not have access to safe drinking water. The present study evaluated a perenial herb, Typha angustata (TA), to purify the spring water. For this purpose, 25 water samples were collected. Majority of samples (20/25) were highly contaminated with microbes ranging colony forming units (CFU) per millileter per Petri dish ranged from 85 to 279 with an average of 136.4. Microbial inhibition of water samples treated with the nonmodified plant extract was observed to be better with the average of 55.5% compared to the treatment with NaOH chemically modified plant where average 46.4% inhibition of microbial load was observed. Four species of microbes such as Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas otitidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae were identified after sequencing. We concluded that T. angustata extract may be used as an antibacterial agent/biosorbent for the purification of drinking water to provide safe drinking water to billions of humans. Practitioner points Spring water samples were collected from 25 different springs. Spring water samples were analyzed for physiochemical parameters. Spring water samples were found to be contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, that is, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas otitidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Pathogenic bacteria in spring water samples were treated with extract of Typha angustata. Extract of Typha angustata was found as a potential antibacterial agent against pathogenic bacteria.",
1211,"Effect of regulated deficit irrigation on alfalfa performance under two irrigation systems in the inland arid area of midwestern China Irrigation plays a fundamental role in sustanining the productivity of agricultural systems in the inland arid area of midwestern China. Deficit irrigation can help to balance yield outcome and water input. Few studies have investigated the impact of deficit irrigation on alfalfa performance, which shows great differences from grain crops in water requirement and management strategy. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of regulated deficit irrigation on forage yield and quality of alfalfa (Medicago sativa). A three year trial was carried out with two irrigation systems (flood irrigation, FI and subsurface drip irrigation, SDI) and seven contrasting regulated irrigation treatments, and alfalfa growth, productivity and water use were measured. Under both irrigation systems, alfalfa forage yield decreased with decreasing irrigation amount under whole stage irrigation, while forage quality improved. However, the performance of alfalfa was different when deficit irrigation was applied at various growth stages. Compared with other deficit irrigation treatments, regulated deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually led to a higher yield. There was an exponential relationship between plant height and forage yield (R-2 = 0.62 for FI and R-2 = 0.57 for SDI) and a linear relationship between leaf area index and forage yield (R-2 = 0.56 for FI and R-2 = 0.64 for SDI). There was a negative correlation between forage yield and quality, which was closer to some quadratic relationships. Therefore, regulated deficit irrigation can help to achieve an ideal yield (up to 34.9 t/ha) and quality in this area. In the inland arid area of midwestern China, subsurface drip irrigation showed a higher irrigation water use efficiency (13.8-84.4 kg/(ha mm)) than flood irrigation (10.8-66.6 kg/(ha mm)) for alfalfa production. With limited water supply, deficit irrigation at single growth stage usually maintained a higher forage yield compared to slightly stressed irrigation during the whole growth. Deficit irrigation at the branching stage led to more negative effect on forage yield compared to other single stages.",
1212,"Adverse childhood experiences, adult depression, and suicidal ideation in rural Uganda: A cross-sectional, population-based study Author summary Why was this study done? Depression is recognized globally as a leading cause of disability. Studies from high-income countries have shown robust associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and depression during adulthood. While studies from sub-Saharan Africa have demonstrated associations between ACEs and depression and suicidality among children, adolescents, and young adults, no study from this region has yet estimated the associations between ACEs and major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation within a whole-population sample of adults. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study of 1,626 adults in rural Uganda, eliciting ACEs, current depression, and suicidal ideation through face-to-face interviews. The cumulative number of ACEs that occurred before age 18 had statistically significant associations with adult depression symptom severity, major depressive disorder, and suicidal ideation. Depression symptom severity and major depressive disorder had statistically significant associations with each of the 9 types of ACEs. Suicidal ideation also had statistically significant associations with living with an adult who was sent to jail or prison during childhood and experiencing food and/or water insecurity during childhood. What do these findings mean? Our interpretation of these findings raises implications for the development of policies and programs that support children, adolescents, and their families, and promote mental health. We are not able to determine the extent to which these associations are causal, and our analysis is susceptible to potential bias from the use of retrospective self-report of ACEs. Background Depression is recognized globally as a leading cause of disability. Early-life adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been shown to have robust associations with poor mental health during adulthood. These effects may be cumulative, whereby a greater number of ACEs are progressively associated with worse outcomes. This study aimed to estimate the associations between ACEs and adult depression and suicidal ideation in a cross-sectional, population-based study of adults in Uganda. Methods and findings Between 2016 and 2018, research assistants visited the homes of 1,626 adult residents of Nyakabare Parish, a rural area in southwestern Uganda. ACEs were assessed using a modified version of the Adverse Childhood Experiences-International Questionnaire, and depression symptom severity and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression (HSCL-D). We applied a validated algorithm to determine major depressive disorder diagnoses. Overall, 1,458 participants (90%) had experienced at least one ACE, 159 participants (10%) met criteria for major depressive disorder, and 28 participants (1.7%) reported suicidal ideation. We fitted regression models to estimate the associations between cumulative number of ACEs and depression symptom severity (linear regression model) and major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation (Poisson regression models). In multivariable regression models adjusted for age, sex, primary school completion, marital status, self-reported HIV status, and household asset wealth, the cumulative number of ACEs was associated with greater depression symptom severity (b = 0.050; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.039-0.061, p < 0.001) and increased risk for major depressive disorder (adjusted relative risk [ARR] = 1.190; 95% CI, 1.109-1.276; p < 0.001) and suicidal ideation (ARR = 1.146; 95% CI, 1.001-1.311; p = 0.048). We assessed the robustness of our findings by probing for nonlinearities and conducting analyses stratified by age. The limitations of the study include the reliance on retrospective self-report as well as the focus on ACEs that occurred within the household. Conclusions In this whole-population, cross-sectional study of adults in rural Uganda, the cumulative number of ACEs had statistically significant associations with depression symptom severity, major depres ive disorder, and suicidal ideation. These findings highlight the importance of developing and implementing policies and programs that safeguard children, promote mental health, and prevent trajectories toward psychosocial disability.",
1213,"Arsenicosis in a village in Bangladesh The study was carried out in a village in Jessore district, Bangladesh, to identify the epidemiological characteristics of arsenicosis. Eighty-seven per cent of the tubewells had arsenic concentration more than the WHO maximum permissible limit of 0.05 mg l(-1). The mean arsenic concentration was 0.240 mg l(-1) and the maximum concentration was 1.371 mg l(-1). Of the total 3606 villagers, 10% (363) were found to be suffering from arsenicosis. Most of the arsenicosis patients were between 10 to 39 years of age. There were more male patients (52.6%). There were no patients among villagers who consumed tubewell water having arsenic levels less than 0.082 mg l(-1). The majority (93.4%) of the patients were in the first and second stage of arsenicosis. With increasing exposure to arsenic, a simultaneous increase in the severity of clinical manifestations of arsenicosis was observed (F=43.699; p=0.000). The time-weighted arsenic exposure varied from 0.248 to 5.482 mg day(-1) and the mean was 1.918 mg day(-1). Melanosis was present in almost all the patient (99.5%) and keratosis was present in 68.9%. Cancer (basal cell epithelioma) was present in three (0.8%) patients. The duration of clinical manifestations of arsenicosis varied from 1 to 12 years and the majority were suffering for 4-6 years.",1
1214,"Study on some aspects of solar photo voltaic thermal storage: A review In the recent times energy crises is increasing specially in the developing nations where dependency on fossil fuels as their prime source which mainly includes oil, coal &amp; gas energy emissions which are exhaustible in nature which leads to increase in greenhouse gases. As solar energy varies in nature with time of day and day of the year, direct solar radiations can now be stored using PV modules in many parts of the world. As a result, solar energy storage has been brought into solar power to eliminate these types of impediments. Review study mainly focuses on thermal properties of various Phase Change materials, air and water collector and its combination. PV module are often further utilized in several ways to achieve better efficiency. Furthermore, the utilization of the newest technologies like Nano fluids as well as phase change materials performance of the system is enhanced. Here our main focus is on solar energy storage because sun is an unlimited source of energy and maximum utilization can be done that's why it is widely growing so in coming years it will acquire energy sector so installation costs can be recovered. Conclusion of the review study deals that with a concentration of 0.3 vol% of Nano fluid, thermal efficiency of hybrid PV/T, flat plate, and evacuated-tube solar collectors has increased by up to 96.3%, 95.13%, and 93.42%, respectively which depends on mass flow rate and temperature variation. Practically we can attain thermal efficiency (Î·th) = 56.19% and electrical efficiency (Î·ele) = 13.75% after hybridization. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.",
1215,"Atoyac River Pollution in the Metropolitan Area of Puebla, Mexico The Atoyac River crosses the metropolitan area of Puebla-Tlaxcala in Mexico and presents a state of pollution that has been scarcely studied. In 2016, the water quality of the river was evaluated based on physicochemical and bacteriological parameters, under the guidelines established for the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for Aquatic Life Protection (ALP) and Agricultural Irrigation (AI). The sampling sites were the Covadonga Dam, the Echeverria Dam, and an irrigation canal. Water from wells and a spring in the Emilio Portes Gil (EPG) population that uses Atoyac water for agricultural irrigation was also analyzed. The data obtained from the river were compared with the 2011 data published in the declaration of classification of Atoyac and Xochiac or Hueyapan and its tributaries. There was a notable increase in hemical oxygen demand (COD) (49%) and in heavy metals with varying percentages. The anoxic condition of the river (mean 1.47 mg of O-2/L) with large populations of coliform bacteria was demonstrated, 11 pathogenic members of the Enterobacteriaceae were found, and high organic pollution concentrations were shown, particularly during droughts.

1216,"PRODUCTION OF NITROCELLULOSE FROM CELLULOSE CULTIVATED IN SOUTH KAZAKHSTAN UNDER SUPERCRITICAL CONDITIONS This article presents the results of a study of the process of producing nitrocellulose from Kazakhstani cellulose raw materials using supercritical technology. Nitration can be carried out both directly and indirectly. Direct nitration processes include the reactions of replacing a hydrogen atom by a nitro group or the addition of nitrating agents via a multiple bond, and indirect nitration involves replacing other atoms or groups of atoms with a nitro group (for example, halogens, sulfo groups). Indirect nitration methods include oxidation reactions of nitrogen-containing substances to nitro compounds, as well as condensation reactions leading to nitro compounds. At the same time, the traditional method of nitration of cellulose is quite ""dirty"" from an environmental point of view, since it spends a huge (several thousand times more than the volume of nitrocellulose obtained) amount of water for the subsequent stage of washing nitrocellulose from nitration mixture residues after nitration. This factor significantly increases the cost of water decontamination and links production to large reservoirs, which is not always possible, especially in arid regions. In addition, due to the relatively small conversion of the nitration process using a nitrating mixture, the production of nitrocellulose requires the construction of large-scale production workshops. Which is also not always justified. Associations with the above are of great interest to alternative nitration technologies, in particular nitration under supercritical conditions. The aim of this work is to study the processes of nitration of cellulose in a supercritical static reactor. For the experiment, the nitration method was chosen in a static supercritical reactor in a carbon dioxide medium using nitric oxide V as a nitrating agent. As a raw material, cotton pulp of the 1st grade was used. The initial reagent for producing nitric oxide V was nitric acid with a concentration of 65% The process was carried out in a static reactor. As a result, a white fibrous mass was obtained, similar in appearance to cellulose, readily soluble in acetone and insoluble in water, the density was 1.63 g / cm(3), based on the density, analysis of the melting temperature and the nature of the combustion, we can conclude pyroxylin with a nitrogen content of 12.05 - 12.4%.",
1217,"An Implementation Evaluation of A Group-Based Parenting Intervention to Promote Early Childhood Development in Rural Kenya Early childhood development (ECD) parenting interventions can improve child developmental outcomes in low-resource settings, but information about their implementation lags far behind evidence of their effectiveness, hindering their generalizability. This study presents results from an implementation evaluation of Msingi Bora (""Good Foundation"" in Swahili), a group-based responsive stimulation and nutrition education intervention recently tested in a cluster randomized controlled trial across 60 villages in rural western Kenya. Msingi Bora successfully improved child cognitive, receptive language, and socioemotional outcomes, as well as parenting practices. We conducted a mixed methods implementation evaluation of the Msingi Bora trial between April 2018 and November 2019 following the Consolidated Advice for Reporting ECD implementation research (CARE) guidelines. We collected qualitative and quantitative data on program inputs, outputs, and outcomes, with a view to examining how aspects of the program's implementation, such as program acceptance and delivery fidelity, related to observed program impacts on parents and children. We found that study areas had initially very low levels of familiarity or knowledge of ECD among parents, community delivery agents, and even supervisory staff from our partner non-governmental organization (NGO). We increased training and supervision in response, and provided a structured manual to enable local delivery agents to successfully lead the sessions. There was a high level of parental compliance, with median attendance of 13 out of 16 fortnightly sessions over 8 months. For delivery agents, all measures of delivery performance and fidelity increased with program experience. Older, more knowledable delivery agents were associated with larger impacts on parental stimulation and child outcomes, and delivery agents with higher fidelity scores were also related to improved parenting practices. We conclude that a group-based parenting intervention delivered by local delivery agents can improve multiple child and parent outcomes. An upfront investment in training local trainers and delivery agents, and regular supervision of delivery of a manualized program, appear key to our documented success. Our results represent a promising avenue for scaling similar interventions in low-resource rural settings to serve families in need of ECD programming.

1218,"Community perceptions on causes of high dizygotic twinning rate in Igbo-Ora, South-west Nigeria: A qualitative study Background Dizygotic (DZ, non-identical) twinning rates vary widely across different regions in the world. With a DZ twinning rate of 45 per 1000 live births, Igbo-Ora Community in South-west Nigeria has the highest dizygotic (DZ) twinning rate in the world. Although several postulations exist on the causes of high DZ twinning rates in Igbo-Ora, no study has yet been conclusive on a definite causative agent. Objective Using qualitative methods, this study explored the perceptions and beliefs of Igbo-Ora residents about the causes of high DZ twinning rates. Methods Focus group discussion sessions and key informant interviews were organized among fathers and mothers of twins, those without twins, and health care providers. Key informant interviews were also held with persons considered to be custodians of culture who may have knowledge relevant to twinning such as traditional rulers, and traditional birth attendants; as well as health care providers, mothers and fathers of twins, and adult twins. Results The results showed three factors featuring as the leading perceived causes of twinning in the community. These included twinning being an act of God, hereditary, and being due to certain foods consumed in the community. Contrary to reports that the consumption of a species of yam (Dioscorea rotundata) may be responsible for the DZ twinning in this Community; yam was not prioritized by the respondents as associated with twinning. In contrast, participants repeatedly mentioned the consumption of ""ilasa"" a soup prepared with okra leaves (Abelmoschus esculenta) with water that is obtained from the community, and ""amala"" a local delicacy produced from cassava (Manihot esculenta) as the most likely dietary factors responsible for twinning in the community. Conclusion Since the same foods are consumed in neighboring communities that have lower rates of twinning, we conjecture that nutritional and other environmental factors may produce epigenetic modifications that influence high DZ twinning rates in Igbo-Ora community. We conclude that more directed scientific studies based on these findings are required to further elucidate the etiology of the high rate of DZ twinning in Igbo-Ora.",
1219,"Radioactivity of sand, groundwater and wild plants in northeast Sinai, Egypt The radioactivity levels are poorly studied in non-coastal arid regions. For this reason, 38 locations covering an area of about 350 km(2) in northeast Sinai, Egypt, were investigated by gamma-ray spectroscopy. Moderately significant correlations among U-238, Th-234, and Ra-226 isotopes and low significant correlations between the concentrations of U-238-series and Th-232 in sand were obtained. No evidence of correlation was found between the concentrations of radioisotopes and pH, grain size, total organic matter content, bicarbonate or calcium carbonate concentrations of the sand samples. The mean values of soil-to-plant transfer factor were 0.15, 0.18, 1.52 and 0.74 for Ra-226, Th-232, K-40, and Cs-137, respectively. The range of concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232, and K-40 in water samples collected from five wells were <0.4-0.16, <0.4-0.13, and <0.15-1.62 Bq 1(-1), respectively. The mean absorbed dose rate in outdoor air at a height of 1 m above the ground surface for the sand samples was 19.4 nGy h(-1).

1220,"Engineering risk assessment on water structures under climate change effects The increase in the average temperature in the lower atmosphere caused by climate change triggers changes in various elements of the hydrological cycle at different scales depending on location in the world. Although numerous published studies are concerned with the effect of climate change on hydrological elements such as temperature, precipitation, evaporation, wind, and runoff, unfortunately, the performance of water engineering structures is not taken into consideration. Nevertheless, as an integral part of the whole water resources systems, engineering structures such as dams, canals, culverts, and wells are also subject to climate change impacts. This examines the performance of engineering structures by taking into account how climate change impacts on the risk assessment formulation. For this purpose, the risk concept is redefined and the climate change impact is taken into account by a factor dependent on the positive or negative slope of the trend from the historical record. The risk levels are revised for 10-year, 50-year, and 100-year return periods. The application of the proposed methodology is given for precipitation records for three different meteorological stations in the southeastern European province of Turkey and for the same number of stations from central east-west belt over Saudi Arabia. It is observed that including the climate change factor in the risk calculation formulation generally leads to an increase in the return period and in the risk compared to conventional calculations. Therefore, it is recommended that rather than using the standard risk formulation, the simple, effective climate change risk approach, as suggested in this paper, be applied to future water engineering structure designs.",

1222,"Dietary Intake of Methionine, Cysteine, and Protein and Urinary Arsenic Excretion in Bangladesh BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, millions of people are exposed to arsenic in drinking water; arsenic is associated with increased risk of cancer. Once ingested, arsenic is metabolized via methylation and excreted in urine. Knowledge about nutritional factors affecting individual variation in methylation is limited. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine associations between intakes of protein, methionine, and cysteine total urinary arsenic in a large population-based sample. METHODS: The study subjects were 10,402 disease-free residents of Araihazar, Bangladesh, who participated in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Food intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire developed for the study population. Nutrient composition was determined by using the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine association between total urinary arsenic across quintiles of nutrient intakes while controlling for arsenic exposure from drinking water and other predictors of urinary arsenic. RESULTS: Greater intakes of protein, methionine, and cysteine were associated with 10-15% greater total urinary arsenic excretion, after controlling for total energy intake, body weight, sex, age, tobacco use, and intake of some other nutrients. CONCLUSIONS: Given previously reported risks between lower rates of arsenic excretion and increased rates of cancer, these findings support the role of nutrition in preventing arsenic-related disease.",
1223,"A nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube enhanced polyethersulfone membrane system for water treatment Water quality in South Africa and around the world continues to deteriorate due to contamination by organic, inorganic and microbial substances. While many efforts have been done to address water quality problems, current drinking water treatment technologies remain costly and do not effectively remove pollutants to acceptable levels. In this work nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes/polyethersulfone (N-CNT/PES) blend membranes were synthesized via a modified phase inversion method and assessed for suitability in drinking water treatment. The N-CNTs with outer diameters of 30-45 nm and 3% N content were prepared using a conventional chemical vapour deposition method and functionalized by refluxing in HNO3. The confirmation and degree of functionalization with -OH and -COOH groups was determined using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and zeta potential analysis. FUR studies confirmed the successful incorporation of functionalized N-CNTs (N-CNTs) in the membrane matrix. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed that the addition of N-CNTs leads to reduced surface roughness, suggesting a good dispersion of the N-CNTs in the matrix. Permeability studies revealed that the addition of N-CNTs to the polyethersulfone (PES) solution increased the water flux of the blend membrane by up to 70%. N-CNT loadings of 0.04 wt% in the blend membranes gave low surface contact angle of 550 and high fluxes. In addition, inclusion of N-CNTs enhanced the mechanical properties of the N-CNT/PES blend membranes. The use of N-CNTs in mixed matrix PES membranes is reported for the first time here. The result already suggests superior compatibility of the N-CNTs with PES compared to undoped CNTs, due to the high surface reactivity of the N-CNTs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1224,"Geotechnical and Environmental Problems. Coal and Spontaneous Combustion This chapter provides a general overview about coal fires based on the research and work undertaken by and also presents case studies of coal fires from South Africa, India, Colombia, and England. The oxidation of coal, when exposed to air during underground or surface mining, can lead to spontaneous combustion. The combustion depends on several interrelated factors that include coal rank, surface area of the coal exposed to air, moisture content, temperature, pyrite (sulfide) content of the coal, and ignition source. One of the factors contributing to spontaneous combustion in abandoned shallow mines is subsidence. For example, the collapse or partial collapse of pillars may generate fissures that extend to the ground surface and thus permit air to enter the mine workings. Similarly, crown holes at the surface allow air to penetrate into the workings. Coal deposits in open cast mines in India and Colombia are susceptible to spontaneous combustion. This generates hazardous working conditions for the mineworkers and causes sterilization of the coal reserves. Some colliery-waste sites in the England have undergone spontaneous combustion for several decades. Removing the upper topsoil and then compacting with a vibrating roller mitigated hot spots recorded at two colliery tips near Barnsley, England. Special investigation techniques may enable combustion mechanisms and the migration of burning fronts to be determined. These investigations at Shirebrook Colliery Tip in Nottinghamshire consisted of temperature monitoring in boreholes, geophysical surveys, and thermal imagery, which enabled the burning front to be located.

1225,"The effective behavior of ZnO and CuO during the solar desalination of brackish water in southern Algeria In order to remedy the shortage of drinking water in southern Algeria where solar irradiance and brackish water are abundant, three solar stills are installed in aim to improve their performance by applying the technique of photo-catalysis, since this application in solar heat transfer processes particularly in the solar distillation of brackish water is promising mostly the use of pure and/or mixed metal oxides which has led to encouraging results in the process engineering laboratory of Ouargla University; so, what is the new in this paper? Here, two metal oxides: ZnO and CuO are added separately with varying masses in order to compare their yields with that of the conventional unit where: 20, 40, and 60 g of each metal oxide are added separately to each unit containing the same constant volume of 3.6 L of brackish water; this showed that the two metal oxides are more effective at their low concentrations. Moreover, adding 20 g of ZnO and 20 g of CuO separately in two different units improves the daily production by 79.39% and 74.76%, respectively, compared to the reference case; additionally, photo-catalyzed units produced a high quality distillate.",
1226,"Impacts of flood disasters in Nigeria: A critical evaluation of health implications and management Floods lead to tremendous losses of property, infrastructure, business and increased risk of diseases. Floods are also the most frequent natural disasters, affecting over 2.8 billion people in the world and causing over 200â€¯000 deaths over the past three decades. The World Health Organization categorised the 2012 flood disaster in Nigeria as the worst flood to have hit the country in the past 50 years. This study reviews flood disasters in Nigeria and how they have been managed over the past two decades. The extensive review of the literature is complemented by data obtained from Ajegunle, a community in Ajeromi-Ifelodun Local Government Area. Because of its proximity to water bodies, its large population and its small land mass, the Ajegunle community is highly susceptible to floods and outbreaks of waterborne diseases. The study also discusses the institutionalisation and development of disaster management in Nigeria. Further, it critically evaluates the disaster management framework and other current disaster management policies as well as the effectiveness and functions of the disaster management focus areas and government response. The study takes a historic approach to flood disasters, linking disaster management to human health with a special focus on flood-related infectious diseases, isolating waterborne diseases as being predominant. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to develop an understanding of how the people of Ajegunle are affected by flood disasters. This study reveals poorly managed health reforms and argues that in spite of government's disaster management policies, there is an absence of organised and coordinated institutional structures to plan and respond to flood emergencies. It also revealed that diarrhoea outbreak was the predominant waterborne disease associated with flood disasters. Although Lagos State has been said to have the best flood preparedness plan in Nigeria, it has failed to reduce the yearly flood disasters and their impact on the health of the people. The article suggests a holistic approach by the government to get stakeholders, especially the health sector, more actively involved in disaster management planning.

1227,"Green infrastructure quality and environmental sustainability in residential neighbourhoods in Lagos, Nigeria Green infrastructure (GI) provides ecosystem services that aid in mitigating the effects of environmental sustainability challenges (ESCs) and improving the health of residents. However, the extent to which GI quality influences environmental challenges (ECs) in highly populated urban settlements in developing countries remains unclear. This paper examined residents' evaluation of GI quality and its influence on environmental sustainability challenges in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 1560 participants in a questionnaire survey. Results of descriptive and regression analysis revealed that the leading ESCs were greenhouse gas emission, waste management, and water quality and GI quality was rated poor by the residents. Availability of adequate, well-equipped green areas and parks had significant influence on ESCs in the study area. The study implies that to effectively mitigate the effects of ESCs more attention should be given to improving the quality and quantity of GI in Lagos Metropolis.",
1228,"Relationship between household wealth inequality and chronic childhood under-nutrition in Bangladesh BACKGROUND: Household food insecurity and under-nutrition remain critically important in developing countries struggling to emerge from the scourge of poverty, where historically, improvements in economic conditions have benefited only certain privileged groups, causing growing inequality in health and healthcare among the population. METHODS: Utilizing information from 5,977 children aged 0-59 months included in the 2004 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey , this study examined the relationship between household wealth inequality and chronic childhood under-nutrition. A child is defined as being chronically undernourished or whose growth rate is adversely stunted, if his or her z-score of height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the median of international reference. Household wealth status is measured by an established index based on household ownership of durable assets. This study utilized multivariate logistic regressions to estimate the effect of household wealth status on adverse childhood growth rate. RESULTS: The results indicate that children in the poorest 20% of households are more than three time as likely to suffer from adverse growth rate stunting as children from the wealthiest 20% of households (OR=3.6; 95% CI: 3.0, 4.3). The effect of household wealth status remain significantly large when the analysis was adjusted for a child's multiple birth status, age, gender, antenatal care, delivery assistance, birth order, and duration that the child was breastfed; mother's age at childbirth, nutritional status, education; household access to safe drinking water, arsenic in drinking water, access to a hygienic toilet facility, cooking fuel cleanliness, residence, and geographic location (OR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.8, 3.2). CONCLUSION: This study concludes that household wealth inequality is strongly associated with childhood adverse growth rate stunting. Reducing poverty and making services more available and accessible to the poor are essential to improving overall childhood health and nutritional status in Bangladesh.",1
1229,"Dermal and neural toxicity caused by acrylamide exposure in two Korean grouting workers: a case report Background: Peripheral neuritis caused by acrylamide is well-known, and many Korean grouting workers are frequently exposed to acrylamide in grouting agents that are injected into cracked concrete. We recently encountered two cases of dermal and neural toxicity in Korean grouting workers with exposure to grouting agents that contained a high concentration of acrylamide. Case presentation: The first case involved a 44-year-old man with 8 years of waterproofing experience. The patient developed peeling skin on both hands while grouting, which progressed to systemic neurological symptoms, such as reduced sensory function and strength. The patient was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy caused by acrylamide exposure, and fully recovered after conservative treatment and withdrawal of exposure to the grouting agent. The second case involved a 34-year-old man with 10 years of grouting experience. The patient initially experienced weakness in both legs, which progressed to weakness in his arms and uncontrolled phonation. After being hospitalized, he was diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy caused by acrylamide exposure, and was discharged after conservative treatment. Our follow-up investigation revealed that both workers were recently exposed to grouting agents that contained higher concentrations of acrylamide, compared to the agents that they had previously been using. Conclusions: Both workers had workplace acrylamide exposure through dermal contact plus inhalation of dust and vapor, which led to the neural toxicity and dermatitis. Therefore, government studies are needed to investigate the current status of workplace acrylamide use, and to protect workers from the hazardous effects of using acrylamide-containing grouting agents.",
1230,"Removal of High Concentrations of Ammonium from Groundwater in a Pilot-Scale System through Aeration at the Bottom Layer of a Chemical Catalytic Oxidation Filter To remove high concentrations of ammonium from groundwater, pure oxygen and compressed air were fed into a chemical catalytic filter and the ammonium removal efficiency was investigated. The experimental results showed that the oxygen content is the critical limiting factor for ammonium removal. Aeration with 40 mL/min pure oxygen or 100 mL/min compressed air from the bottom of the filter supplied adequate oxygen and approximately 4.2 mg/L of ammonium was removed in this process. Moreover, when the aeration device was moved to 1/3 of the height of the filter bed, the required flow rates of pure oxygen and compressed air decreased further and the turbidity removal was improved. Pouring ozone gas into the filter system, which can inactivate bacteria effectively, can also obtain the remarkable ammonium removal, indicating that ammonium removal was mainly due to the chemical catalytic oxidation in this process rather than the biodegradation. This study provides a novel method for removing high concentrations of ammonium from groundwater.",
1231,"X-STREAM - AN INNOVATIVE PIPELINE SOLUTION TO THE CHALLENGES OF EXTREME WATER DEPTHS In South America, the recent fields discovered in the pre-salt area are located more than 300km away from the coast, which makes exploring and especially the transportation of associated gas a major challenge in the coming years. Several issues are related to this problem: distance to shore (more than 300 km) and ultra-deepwater (more than 2000 m); vessel time and capacity (reduced number of boats/offshore units with capacity to install pipelines in deepwater); increasing demand for these vessels worldwide; flaring restrictions in accordance with Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP). Deepwater pipelines have traditionally been built using very thick pipe walls, requiring large quantities of steel and special equipment for milling and pipe laying. This paper presents an innovative gas transportation concept for long distance in ultra-deep waters (X-Stream Pipeline Concept). A way to potentially reduce the required wall thickness of deep water pipelines by controlling in the differential pressure across the pipe wall (and thus allowing for a reduction in the pipeline wall thickness). This concept is also applicable in other deepwater exploratory frontiers, for instance: Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.",

1233,"Modelling rainfall-runoff processes of the Chemoga and Jedeb meso-scale catchments in the Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia The objective of this study is to understand the rainfall-runoff processes of the meso-scale Chemoga and Jedeb catchments in the Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. Distributed conceptual modelling and different field data were used in the modelling process. Three different model representations with varying model complexity were employed to test the appropriate model structure. Parameters were conditioned within the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) framework using both discharge and environmental isotope information indicating the ratio of new and old water during the wet season. It was demonstrated that the two catchments cannot be modelled equally well with the same model structure due to differences in the rainfall-runoff processes caused by different amounts of wetlands leading to different hydrological responses. Hence, a single model structure for the entire Abay/Upper Blue Nile cannot do justice to all the dominant hydrological processes in the various sub-catchments in the basin.",

1235,"Proposal for MSW contaminant classification applied to a tropical aquifer Groundwater is a natural resource exploited worldwide causing danger due to the lixiviation of waste deposited, which presents high potential degradation. Internationally, regulation aims for the maintenance of the quality of this resource. But the local lithology, mainly in countries with tropical weather, was not considered. This paper has an objective to propose two methodologies of contaminant identification of municipal solid waste (MSW) considering the Brazilian regulation, the local lithology and the temporal aspect. The study site is located in the midwest of SÃ£o Paulo, at the MarÃ­lia Formation, Bauru Aquifer, which presents sandstone rich in calcite. At first, the historic monitoring data accumulated between 2002 and 2015 were statistically organized. Then, methodologies of classification of major constituents and contamination method were developed. After these analyses, the compounds that possibly cause anomaly in the local environment are Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, phosphatic, nitrogenous, and sulfated compounds, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, and Pb. Some of these have lithogenic genesis typical of tropical environment, and others come from the disposed waste. Despite different approaches, both methods demonstrate efficiency in identifying the pollutants presenting distinctions among themselves in conjunction with actual local regulation and the lithogenic source of certain compounds.",
1236,"Levels, source determination and health implications of trace metals in groundwater within the Lower Pra Basin, Ghana Two hundred and fifty samples were collected from fifty-five (No) boreholes on quarterly basis between March 2011 and October 2012 covering the wet and dry seasons within the Lower Pra Basin for water quality assessment. The analytical results show that groundwater being used by some communities within the basin is contaminated, with Al (19.2 % of boreholes), Se (18.4 % of boreholes), Cd (18 % of boreholes), As (11.6 % of boreholes), Pb (39.6 % of boreholes), Mn (5.6 % of boreholes), Hg (42 % of boreholes) and Fe (21.6 % of boreholes) at levels exceeding the WHO (Guidelines for drinking water quality. Revision of the 1993 guidelines, 2004) guideline limits for drinking water. The stability of iron species for the groundwater system under the prevailing pE/pH condition shows that amorphous Fe(OH)(3) significantly controls the concentration of iron in groundwater within the basin. The results also show that pyrite and arsenopyrite oxidation processes in groundwater within the basin are not exclusively responsible for the concentration of iron in the boreholes. Calculated saturation indices (SI) of the iron and manganese species using PHREEQC for Windows show that the groundwaters are generally undersaturated with respect to melanterite (FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O), siderite (FeCO3), hausmannite (Mn3O4), pyrolusite (MnO2), rhodochrosite (MnCO3), manganite (MnOOH) and pyrochroite [Mn(OH2)], and supersaturated with respect to goethite (FeOOH) and haematite (Fe2O3). Human health risks assessment show that, for both adults and children via ingestion route, the mean HQ(ing) levels were found in the order of Zn > Fe = Cu > Pb > Cd > Mn. Results further show that the HQ/HI is the same for both adults and children for all trace metals and are less than 1. Thus, the trace metals considered in this study are not of concern for potential human health risk caused by exposure to noncarcinogenic elements.",1
1237,"Carbon footprint of India's groundwater irrigation India has an intricate nexus of groundwater irrigation, energy and climate. Subsidized electricity supply has led to unregulated groundwater pumping, causing a decrease in groundwater level and increase in carbon emissions. This complex nexus necessitates estimation of carbon emissions from groundwater irrigation. The study uses actual pumping data on 20.5 million groundwater structures from the Fifth Minor Irrigation Census (reference year 2013-14) to estimate carbon emissions. The estimates show that groundwater irrigation emits 45.3-62.3 MMT of carbon annually, contributing 8-11% of India's total carbon emission. This analysis shows deep tubewells have a huge carbon footprint, and their growing number is a serious environmental concern. Spatial analysis reveals India's western and peninsular region, which houses 85% of the country's over-exploited groundwater blocks, contributes most to carbon emission. Moreover, this region hosts 27 districts which are groundwater-energy-climate nexus hotspots, together accounting for 34% of carbon emissions from groundwater irrigation. Comparison with the previous estimate reveals that carbon emission from groundwater irrigation nearly doubled between 2000 and 2013. Findings of this study are vital to the discourse on the increasing environmental costs of groundwater pumping in the country and will contribute to carbon emission mitigation strategies.",
1238,"Four decades of water recycling in Atlantis (Western Cape, South Africa): Past, present and future The primary aquifer at Atlantis (Western Cape, South Africa) is ideally suited for water supply and the indirect recycling of urban stormwater runoff and treated domestic wastewater for potable purposes. The relatively thin, sloping aquifer requires careful management of the artificial recharge and abstraction for balancing water levels. Water quality management is a further key issue at Atlantis for ensuring the highest quality potable water. Groundwater quality varies from point to point in the aquifer, while urban runoff and wastewater qualities vary greatly. The layout of the town allows for the separation of stormwater from the residential and industrial areas as well as separate treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater. This permits safe artificial recharge of the various water quality portions at different points in the aquifer, either for recycling or for preventing seawater intrusion. All of the management actions are dependent on detailed data collection and this paper describes the various parts of the system, describes the data collection activities, and provides results of the monitoring and aquifer responses over the past four decades. Challenges related to iron fouling of production boreholes are also described. The presence of emerging contaminants was studied in 2008 but requires follow-up research for establishing the extent of any possible threat to water recycling. In order to address the shortcomings of the system a risk management plan based on the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points approach was developed. Lessons learnt from the Atlantis experience can be transferred to other potential sites for establishment of similar systems in arid and semi-arid areas of South Africa and the African continent.",
1239,"[On-Site Analysis of Heavy Metals in Water with Handheld X-Ray Fluorescence and Pre-Concentration Device without External Power Supply] Currently, increasing importance has been attached to heavy metal pollution of water environment. In order to help geologist and environmentalist to obtain on-site experimental data, there is an urgent need to develop portable analysis techniques of water quality, which can be used to give an timely and accurate assessment of water quality of the contaminated area with low cost and to monitor water environment conveniently in daily preventing and controlling work of water pollution. Based on adsorption with Purolite S930 chelating resin at pH 4 and thin-film sample preparation technique, a rapid and simple on-site-oriented analysis method of heavy metal ions, namely Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb in aqueous solutions, was developed utilizing a handheld energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence in this paper. The correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were greater than 0.992 for all six metal ions, the lower limits of detection were between 5.8 and 18.6 Î¼gÂ·L-1. Precision tests carried out on multi-element mixed solutions showed that the relative standard deviations (RSD, n=10) were better than 15%. The method has been used on-site to analysis 21 water samples collected from different river or well sites near a mining area northeast China. Out of the five underground water samples one was found contaminated by Cu and Zn (Class â…¢), one by Zn and Fe (Class â…¡), and one by Fe(in between Class â…¡ to â…¢). Surface water samples showed better qualities. But two out of the sixteen were found to be contaminated by Mn heavily (Class â…£). Laboratory ICPMS was used to analyze the same samples. The results for Cu, Ni and Pb were coincident with the on-site data in general. But for Zn and Mn with higher concentrations, on-site data were lower than that by ICPMS. The reason for that might be the inclusion of the fine suspending particles in the samples by ICPMS. We conclude that the on-site data were effective. With the described method, an overall data acquisition time, including sampling, processing and measuring, can be within 12 hours for a batch of 10 samples. The pre-concentration device and the XRF instrument are both small, light, portable and can operate without external power supply. So, the method is suitable for on-site water sample analysis, especially in remote areas.",1
1240,"Safety assessment of Generation III nuclear power plant buildings subjected to commercial aircraft crash Part II: Structural damage and vibrations Investigations of the commercial aircraft impact effect on nuclear island infrastructures have been drawing extensive attention, and this paper aims to perform the safety assessment of Generation III nuclear power plant (NPP) buildings subjected to typical commercial aircrafts crash. At present Part II, based on the verified finite element (FE) models of aircrafts Airbus A320 and A380, as well as the NPP containment and auxiliary buildings in Part I of this paper, the whole collision process is reproduced numerically by adopting the coupled missile-target interaction approach with the finite element code LS-DYNA. The impact induced damage of NPP plant under four impact locations of containment (cylinder, air intake, conical roof and PCS water tank) and two impact locations of auxiliary buildings (exterior wall and roof of spent fuel pool room) are evaluated. Furthermore, by considering the inner structures in the containment and raft foundation of NPP, the structural vibration analyses are conducted under two impact locations (middle height of cylinder, main control room in the auxiliary buildings). It indicates that, within the discussed scenarios, NPP structures can withstand the impact of both two aircrafts, while the functionality of internal equipment on higher floors will be affected to some extent under impact induced vibrations, and A380 aircraft will cause more serious structural damage and vibrations than A320 aircraft. The present work can provide helpful references to assess the safety of the structures and inner equipment of NPP plant under commercial aircraft impact.

1241,"Impacts of soil carbon on hydrological responses - A sensitivity study of scenarios across diverse climatic zones in South Africa Soil organic carbon (SOC) content and the water holding capacity of soils are two properties which link the carbon and hydrological cycles. Hydrological model inputs seldom include soil carbon as a parameter even though soil carbon content is known to influence soil water retention capacities. This study is a sensitivity analysis of changes in hydrological responses when the model inputs include different soil carbon percentages for the topsoil horizon. Sensitivities of hydrological responses such as transpiration, runoff volumes, the stormflow component of runoff and extreme runoff events to SOC content were quantified under various climatic conditions in South Africa. The soil water holding capacities at the drained upper limit (i.e. field capacity), permanent wilting point and saturation were calculated for the topsoil horizon, using SOC dependent pedo (soil)-transfer functions for different soil carbon scenarios and locations in South Africa. These variables, together with other pre-determined soil- and location-related inputs, as well as 50 years of daily climate, were then used as inputs in a process-based hydrological model. Overall, it was found that increased SOC content in the topsoil horizon leads to an increase in transpiration, a reduction in runoff, especially in its stormflow component, and a reduction of extreme runoff events. However, these changes are relatively small compared to the influence of climate, particularly of rainfall amount and distribution. Significance: â€¢ Organic carbon content of the soil and the water holding capacity of soils link the carbon and hydrological cycles. â€¢ Management interventions that increase SOC lead to win-win situations because, in addition to climate change mitigation, plant water availability improves, and overall surface runoff 'flashiness' becomes more regulated. â€¢ While rainfall amount and distribution over space and time remain the most critical determinants of hydrological responses, increased SOC in the topsoil horizon leads to increases in transpiration and thus plant growth, and to a reduction in runoff, especially in its stormflow component, and hence to a small reduction of severe flooding events.

1242,"Land cover properties and rain water harvesting in urban environments Water harvesting is an ancient practice that has been used, mainly in dry environments, to increase efficiency of water collection and use by directing water from a large natural watershed or man-made collection surface into a small basin where the water can be stored in underground reservoirs or to be used directly for irrigation or domestic uses. In modern era water harvesting has been neglected, particularly at the developed countries, due to the technological achievements in the fields of water production and transport. Nevertheless, over recent years, water harvesting in modern-urban environments becomes a necessary practice. The urban regions are being paved and built, resulting in reduction of groundwater recharge area. Consequently, large amount of good quality water that rains over the cities is withdrawn from recharge as it is directed into the municipal drainage system. Moreover, in extreme rain events the drainage systems may be over-flooded which may lead to ecologic and economic hazards. This work reviews the history of rain water harvesting and discusses the impact of rain water harvesting in modern urban environments on the hydrological system. Two types of rain water harvesting methods are being discussed and compared: storing of the harvested water in reservoirs and direct infiltration of the harvested water into the aquifer. Quantitative examples from Tel-Aviv, Israel are given and indicate that rain water harvesting may play an important role in the local and regional hydrological cycle and that direct infiltration of the harvested water into the aquifer is preferable for heavily populated cities.

1243,"Building Resilience of Urban Slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh This paper is derived from a pilot project implemented by Habitat for Humanity during 2012-2013, where the author was a technical advisor. Rapid urbanisation and the growth of slums in developing countries such as Bangladesh has led to slum upgrading as an approach to address the problems of the urban poor. The project here was in essence such a slum upgrading project, targeted at an urban slum settlement called Talab Camp in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where the residents comprised an ethnic Bihari community. Dhaka is a rapidly urbanising megacity in one of the world's most densely populated and poorest countries, where almost 30% of its more than 14 million population lives in slums and faces the impacts of a range of hazards, hence the need for building resilience. The project began with a study of this urban context to identify the challenges and opportunities for building resilience in slums there, followed by a sequence of inter-related activities. This consisted of provision of training to local professionals on concepts and applications of Urban Resilience and toolkits for Risk Assessment and Action Planning; a Community Based Participatory Risk Assessment (CBPRA) to identify the inter-related hazards and vulnerabilities affecting Talab Camp, supplemented by a survey of city level institutional actors; and a set of pilot activities guided by the above and Community Action Planning (CAP) workshops, together with community capacity building and developing community organisations. Three main risks were prioritised for addressing in the pilot activities inadequate drainage, inadequate waste disposal and poor sanitation, and thereby focused on WaSH (drainage, community toilets, water supply, and water purification), solid waste management (household and community level waste collection and disposal), housing improvement (plinth-raising above flood level) and awareness raising (cleaning event and billboards). The pilot activities also included extensive training and capacity building activities. A long-term Community Development Plan (CDP) was also developed in parallel to the pilot activities. The project faced a number of challenges in terms of local expectations, capacity building, and working in a megacity like Dhaka. A number of key lessons were learnt including the time required for adequate community consultation and participation, and unpredictability of political circumstances, in addition to a set of other lessons that can inform future such projects.

1244,"An application of the holistochastic human exposure methodology to naturally occurring arsenic in Bangladesh drinking water The occurrence of arsenic in drinking water is an issue of considerable interest. In the case of Bangladesh, arsenic concentrations have been closely monitored since the early 1990s through an extensive sampling network. The focus of the present work is methodological. In particular, we propose the application of a holistochastic framework of human exposure to study lifetime population damage due to arsenic exposure across Bangladesh. The Bayesian Maximum Entropy theory is an important component of this framework, which possesses solid theoretical foundations and offers powerful tools to assimilate a variety of knowledge bases (physical, epidemiologic, toxicokinetic, demographic, etc.) and uncertainty sources (soft data, measurement errors, etc.). The holistochastic exposure approach leads to physically meaningful and informative spatial maps of arsenic distribution in Bangladesh drinking water. Global indicators of the adverse health effects on the population are generated, and valuable insight is gained by blending information from different scientific disciplines. The numerical results indicate an increased lifetime bladder cancer probability for the Bangladesh population due to arsenic. The health effect estimates obtained and the associated uncertainty assessments are valuable tools for a broad spectrum of end-users.",1

This cluster-randomised trial evaluates whether families living in extreme poverty (Ubudehe 1, the poorest category in the Government of Rwanda's wealth ranking) who receive Sugira Muryango in combination with a government-provided social protection programme demonstrate greater responsive, positive caregiving, nutrition, care seeking, hygiene, and father involvement compared with control families receiving usual care (UC).MethodsUsing detailed maps, we grouped closely spaced villages into 284 geographic clusters stratified by the type of social protection programmes operating in the village clusters; 198 clusters met all enrolment criteria. Sugira Muryango was delivered to n =541 families in 100 treatment clusters with children aged 6-36months living in extreme poverty. We assessed changes in outcomes in intervention and n =508 UC control families using structured surveys and observation. Analyses were intent to treat using mixed models to accommodate clustering.ResultsFamilies receiving Sugira Muryango improved on core outcomes of parent-child relationships assessed using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (Cohen's d =0.87, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99) and the Observation of Mother-Child Interaction (Cohen's d =0.29, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.41).

1246,"Components of stand water balance of a larch plantation after thinning during the extremely wet and dry years in the Loess Plateau, China Forest thinning is often used as a strategy to augment water supply by decreasing stand evapotranspiration. To study the influence of such thinning on the water balance of a Larch (Larix principis-upprechtii Mayr.) plantation in the water-limited Loess Plateau of Northwest China, this study analyzed the components of the stand water balance after thinning during an extremely wet and dry year using the water balance approach. Tree transpiration (Et) was measured by tree sap flow, which was scaled to the plot level. The canopy interception loss (E-c) was estimated by subtracting the throughfall and stemflow from the gross precipitation. Unerstory evapotranspiration (E-u) was measured by weighing microlysimeters in each plot. Changes in the soil moisture were manually measured by the drying method. The results showed that thinning enhanced the stand-level soil water moisture due to the increased throughfall in the Larch plantation. Thinning induced decreases in E-t and E-c, while increasing E-u and water yield during the observation periods. With regard to the components of evapotranspiration (ET), thinning increased the contribution of E-u to ET, and decreased the contribution of E-t and E-c to ET. The decrease in LAI due to thinning also led to an increase in water yield and a decrease in both E-t and E-c. Only high-intensity thinning can maintain the water yield function under the extreme drought. Under the current conditions, thinning to less than 844 stems/hm2 may be a very good option to increase the water yield. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

1248,"The dehydroxylation of chlorite and the formation of topotactic product phases Single-crystal, X-ray examination of Mg,Fe-rich chlorites that were heated at 650 degrees C for 24 hours in air and have undergone dehydroxylation of the interlayer shows that two product phases result with a topotactic relationship, with the c axis of both phases parallel. One phase (''modified chlorite'' or ''14-A phase'') has relatively sharp reflections with a 14-A c-axis repeat, indicating that it is well crystallized and maintains the 2:1 layer from the parent. Cell parameters are a = 5.368(1)A, b = 9.297(2)A, c = 14.215(6)A, alpha = 89.86(3)degrees, beta = 97.15(3)degrees, gamma = 89.98(2)degrees, and it crystallizes in C (1) over bar symmetry. A structure refinement, details of which will be reported later, indicates that the interlayer consists of two planes, each containing (M + O), where M is the interlayer cation species. These planes show about +/-0.5A positional disorder along the [001] direction. There is no evidence for scattering material at z = 0.5 between the 2:1 layers. The second phase in the topotactic relationship is based on a 27-A unit c axis (''27-A phase''). The diffraction data are limited with about 15 diffuse reflections observed, indicating that it is poorly crystallized. The 27-A spacing suggests that both octahedral sheets in the parent chlorite contribute to the formation of this phase. Heating Mg,Fe-rich chlorite powder in a closed system to 550 degrees C, under either reducing or oxidizing conditions, prevents the formation of the 27-A phase. Because the 27-A phase forms in an open system, we infer that water fugacity is an important factor in its formation. Heating experiments involving samples with different polytypes and octahedral ''type'' (dioctahedral vs trioctahedral) of the 2:1 layer suggests that these two variables are important. However, the results are equivocal, and an ill-defined B-rich chlorite from Madagascar breaks the observed trends for both variations in stacking sequence and octahedral type. However, B-content may be a factor in the transformation also for those chlorites that contain B.",
1249,"Variability in the origins and pathways of Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent water The Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) transports water originating from a number of distinct source regions, eastward across the Pacific Ocean. It is responsible for supplying nutrients to the productive eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Of particular importance is the transport of iron by the EUC; the limiting nutrient in that region. Although the mean circulation and sources of EUC water are reasonably well understood, it is unclear how the contribution of water from these sources to the EUC vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. Here a Lagrangian analysis is applied to the eddy-resolving OFAM3 ocean simulation in order to identity variability in the makeup of the EUC over an 18 year period (1993-2010). While ENSO has an influence on the variability of source transport contributions to the EUC, the signal of increased (decreased) transport of water from the LLWBCs during El NiÃ±o (La NiÃ±a) periods does not translate to substantial changes in the makeup of the EUC between 165Â°E and 140Â°W. It is hypothesized that this is due to the large spread in travel times of water parcels as they travel from the source regions into the EUC. The consequent erosion of transport anomalies generated at the different western boundary source regions associated with ENSO may help explain why previous studies found little relationship between variability in iron fluxes off Papua New Guinea shelves and the chlorophyll response in the eastern tropical Pacific. Key Points: A Lagrangian framework is used to backtrack EUC water sources Increased LLWBC water during El NiÃ±o is smeared out within the EUC Travel times and particle positions from individual sources exhibit large spread Â© 2015.

A major challenge is to understand and potentially mitigate the consequences of these changes, for the capacity of forests to deliver essential environmental services to rural areas. Here, we focus on unraveling the mechanisms underpinning spatial variation in forest leaf area index. Forest leaf area index can be used as an environmental indicator that controls key forest functions underlying environmental services and is also expected to respond to land use change. Specifically, we use Structural Equation Modelling to determine the direct and indirect pathways that link environmental drivers to canopy leaf area index (LAI) variation across forest types in the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil. We sampled 240 sample units (each 4000 m(2)), from a systematic and permanent forest inventory set which covers the State of Santa Catarina in a 10 km x 10 km grid, using hemispherical photographs. Environmental variables were extracted for each sample unit, including climatic and topographic data as well as indicators of anthropogenic pressure. Our results showed that forest types differed in their leaf area index (but not all of them) and that forest canopies show complex responses to environmental drivers, encompassing direct and indirect pathways. A major pathway was the positive effect of 'Distance to city' on the 'Percentage of cropland in the matrix'. This led to a decline in the distance of the sample unit to the forest edge, indirectly reducing LAI, presumably because of elevated tree mortality at the forest edge. 'Terrain steepness' and 'Rainfall in the driest month' independently affected the 'Percentage of cropland in the matrix' and the 'Distance to forest edge'. Halting forest fragmentation and increasing fragment size by landscape planning will mitigate these anthropogenic LAI declines. This can be achieved with a combination of legal and market mechanisms, like enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Act regulation on buffer zones around water bodies and steep slopes, landscape planning, and payment for environmental services to compensate the farmers for maintaining forest cover on otherwise productive land.",
1251,"Comparison of water-soluble inorganic ions and trace metals in PM2.5 between online and offline measurements in Beijing during winter As the widespread application of online instruments in atmospheric monitoring, an increasing number of studies such as source apportionment researches are based on the high-resolution online monitoring data. Accurate online monitoring data are very critical in the model evaluation as well. However, there is a very limited number of comparison studies investigating the quality of online monitoring data compared to the traditional offline filter-based data. In this study, two high-time resolved instruments, including In-situ Gas and Aerosol Composition and Xact, were applied to measure the water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) and trace elements in PM2.5, respectively, in Beijing during winter 2015. These online results were then compared with corresponding offline filter-based measurement for 8 ions and 13 trace elements. Good agreement (R-2 > 0.8, 0.8 < slope < 1.5) for most WSIIs (e.g. NO3-, NH4+, Cl-, Na+, and SO42-) and trace elements (e.g. Pb, K, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Fe, Cr, and Se) can be found between the two methods. The comparison results for K+, Ba and Ca were marginally acceptable, whereas the relatively poor performance of Mg2+, As, and Cd need further evaluation due to their low concentrations, a large proportion of which was below the method detection limit. The overall performance of online monitoring has been shown comparable to offline measurement and the potential influences on source apportionment results due to online and offline measurements are discussed.",
1252,"Soil moisture drought detection and multi-temporal variability across China Soil moisture droughts can trigger abnormal changes of material and energy cycles in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system, leading to important effects on local ecosystem, weather, and climate. Drought detection and understanding benefit disaster alleviation, as well as weather and climate predictions based on the understanding the land-atmosphere interactions. We thus simulated soil moisture using land surface model CLM3.5 driven with observed climate in China, and corrected wet bias in soil moisture simulations via introducing soil porosity parameter into soil water parameterization scheme. Then we defined soil moisture drought to quantify spatiotemporal variability of droughts. Over the period from 1951 to 2008, 40% of months (to the sum of 12x58) underwent droughts, with the average area of 54.6% of total land area of Mainland China. The annual monthly drought numbers presented a significant decrease in arid regions, but a significant increase in semi-arid and semi-humid regions, a decrease in humid regions but not significant. The Mainland as a whole experienced an increasing drought trend, with 77.3% of areal ratio of decrease to increase. The monthly droughts in winter were the strongest but the weakest in summer, impacting 54.3% and 8.4% total area of the Mainland, respectively. The drought lasting three months or more occurred mainly in the semi-arid and semi-humid regions, with probability > 51.7%, even > 77.6%, whereas those lasting 6 and 12 months or more impacted mainly across arid and semi-arid regions.",
1253,"Impact of SO2 on Alteration of Reservoir Rock with Ca-Deficient Conditions and Poor Buffering Capacity under a CO2 Geologic Storage Condition The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of SO2-CO2-water-rock interaction on the alteration of a reservoir rock having Ca-deficient conditions and little buffering capacity and its implication for porosity change near the injection well from a CO2 storage pilot site, Republic of Korea. For our study, three cases of experimental and geochemical modeling were carried out (pure CO2, 0.1% SO2 in CO2, and 1% SO2 in CO2, resp.) under realistic geologic storage conditions. Our results show that SO2 accelerated water-rock interactions by lowering the pH. In the 1% SO2 case, pH remained less than 2 during the experiments because of insufficient buffering capacity. Sulfate minerals were not precipitated because of an insufficient supply of Ca. Because the total volume of precipitated secondary minerals was less than that of the dissolved primary minerals, the porosity of rock increased in all cases. Chlorite largely contributed to the decrease in total rock volume although it formed only 4.8 wt.% of the rock. Our study shows that the coinjection of a certain amount of SO2 at CO2 storage reservoirs without carbonate and Ca-rich minerals can significantly increase the porosity by enhancing water-rock interactions. This procedure can be beneficial to CO2 injection under some conditions.",
1254,"A Pilot Study to Examine the Disparities in Water Quality between Predominantly Haitian Neighborhoods and Dominican Neighborhoods in Two Cities in the Dominican Republic Worldwide, diarrheal disease is a leading cause of death affecting over 1.7 million individuals annually. Much of this can be attributed to lack of clean water, sanitation and hygiene. Nearly all of these deaths occur in countries with developing economies. This public health problem is apparent in the island of Hispaniola; the island that is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Significant gaps in income between the countries have resulted in Haitians migrating into the Dominican Republic. While there has been increased migration into the Dominican Republic, many of the neighborhoods remain segregated. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted at 49 sites in the Dominican Republic. Samples were classified as being from a Haitian neighborhood or Dominican neighborhood and analyzed for microbial contamination. Overall, Haitian neighborhoods were found to have statistically significantly higher levels of contamination of both coliform and E. coli. The odds of having E. coli contaminated water in Haitian neighborhoods are 4.25 times as high as Dominican neighborhoods. The odds of having coliform contaminated water in Haitian neighborhoods are 4.78 times as high as Dominican neighborhoods. This study provides evidence of the disparity in access to clean drinking water for Haitian immigrants and highlights the need for further investigation.",
1255,"A Graphical Interpretation of the Rescaled Complementary Relationship for Evapotranspiration Wet-surface evaporation equations related to the Penman equation can be represented graphically on vapor pressure (e) versus temperature (T) graphs (Qualls & Crago, 2020, ). Here, actual regional evaporation is represented graphically on (e, T) graphs using the Complementary Relationship (CR) between actual and apparent potential evaporation. The CR proposed by the authors can be represented in a simple and intuitive geometric form, in which lines representing the regional latent heat flux, LE, and the wet surface (Priestley & Taylor, 1972, ) evaporation rate, LEPT, intersect at e = 0. This approach allows a graphical estimate of LE (or the corresponding mathematical formulation), provided available energy, wind speed, air temperature and humidity, and roughness lengths for momentum and sensible heat are available. The wet surface temperature is needed, and a calculation method for it is provided. The formulation works well using monthly data from seven sites in Australia, even when the same value of the Priestley & Taylor parameter alpha is used for all sites. Overall, compared to eddy covariance measurements, root mean square difference averaged 19 W m(-2); this compares favorably with the CR formulation proposed by Brutsaert (2015, ).",
1256,"Prediction of Indian summer monsoon in short to medium range time scale with high resolution global forecast system (GFS) T574 and T382 Performance of national centers for environmental prediction based global forecast system (GFS) T574/L64 and GFS T382/L64 over Indian region has been evaluated for the summer monsoon season of 2011. The real-time model outputs are generated daily at India Meteorological Department, New Delhi for the forecasts up to 7 days. Verification of rainfall forecasts has been carried out against observed rainfall analysis. Performance of the model is also examined in terms of lower tropospheric wind circulation, vertical structure of specific humidity and precipitable water content. Case study of a monsoon depression is also illustrated. Results obtained show that, in general, both the GFS T382 and T574 forecasts are skillful to capture climatologically heavy rainfall regions. However, the accuracy in prediction of location and magnitude of rainfall fluctuates considerably. The verification results, at the spatial scale of 50 km resolution, in a regional spatial scale and country as a whole, in terms of continuous skill score, time series and categorical statistics, have demonstrated superiority of GFS T574 against T382 over Indian region. Both the model shows bias of lower tropospheric drying and upper tropospheric moistening. A bias of anti-cyclonic circulation in the lower tropospheric level lay over the central India, where rainfall as well as precipitable water content shows negative bias. Considerable differences between GFS T574 and T382 are noticed in the structure of model bias in terms of lower tropospheric wind circulation, vertical structure of specific humidity and precipitable water contents. The magnitude of error for these parameters increases with forecast lead time in both GFS T574 and T382. The results documented are expected to be useful to the forecasters, monsoon researchers and modeling community.",
1257,"Metallogeny of the Lannigou sedimentary rock-hosted disseminated gold deposit in southwestern Guizhou Province, China The Lannigou deposit is a large-sized sedimentary rock-hosted disseminated gold (SRHDG) deposit located in the Youjiang Basin. It is hosted by the Middle Triassic turbidite. Wall rock alterations, including silicification, pyritization, arsenopyritization, carbonatization and argillization, commonly occur along fractures. PGE study demonstrates that either Permian basalts or Triassic ultrabasic intrusives are unlikely to be the main source of gold mineralization. Coupled with the lack of other magmatic activity in the vicinity of the mining area, an amagmatic origin is proposed. Organic matter compositions and GC-MS analysis of the ores and host rocks show that the organics in the ores and the host rocks have a common source; the organic matter in the ores was mainly indigenous. The positive correlation between S-2 and An contents, along with the common occurrence of organic inclusions, suggest involvement of organic matter in the ore-forming process in terms of promoting Au leaching from the source rocks, making colloidal An migration possible, as well as hydrocarbon reduction of sulphate. Geological and geochemical characteristics of the Lannigou deposit suggest that it was formed through circulation of meteoric water and probably less importantly organic bearing formation water driven by high geothermal gradient caused by late Yanshanian extension, which leached Au from the source bed, and then migrated as Au-bisulfides and colloidal An, culminating in deposition by reduction-adsorption and surface complexation of gold onto the growth surface of arsenian pyrite.",
1258,"Identifying effects of pipe material, hydraulic condition, and water composition on elemental accumulation in pipe corrosion scales Identification of the accumulation mechanism of major elements on pipe surface is essential to investigate the development of corrosion scales and co-occurrence of trace inorganic contaminants. In this study, corrosion scale samples were collected from old, corroded iron pipes made of different materials and exposed to different water qualities and operation conditions. Elemental composition of these scales was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Cumulative occurrence analysis, Q-style hierarchical cluster analysis (CA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to ascertain major elements typical for corrosion scales and to estimate the dominant influencing factor to each elemental constituent. The major elements in the examined scales are Fe, C, Zn, Si, Ca, Al, and S in the descending prevalence. Their occurrences are influenced by an interactive effect. Pipe material imposes a significant effect on the accumulation of Fe, Zn, and Ca in corrosion scales; water composition can account for the presence of Si, Al, and S in this study; hydraulic condition is identified as the primary factor influencing the occurrence of C and Ca. Q-style CA and PCA are verified practicable for data interpretation and identification of dominant factors influencing scale characteristics.",
1259,"Porphyry copper mineralization at the koloula igneous complex, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands The Koloula Igneous Complex on the island of Guadalcanal consists of a low-K calc- alkaline sequence of 26 different intrusive phases. The oldest phase is a leucogabbro within which occurs a tabular cumulate body of olivine pyroxenite. Younger phases include diorites, quartz diorites, tonalites and trondhjemite, and aplite dikes. Two major cycles of igneous activity are recognized, as well as at least four periods of andesitic dike intrusion. Four distinct episodes of hydrothermal alteration occurred within the sequence of igneous events. Two of these episodes were associated with porphyritic intrusions of tonalitic composition that show textural and fluid inclusion evidence consistent with boiling. These intrusions are spatially and temporally associated with minor copper mineralization. The earlier, or A, alteration system has five distinguishable concentric zones. The innermost is sulfide free and contains alkali feldspar-quartz-magnetite-actinolite Â± pyroxene (salite). It is succeeded by zones consisting of potassic and propylitic alteration assemblages, containing chalcopyrite and bornite in the potassic zones. The later, or B, system is characterized by four zones in which chlorite, sericite, and lesser amounts of clay minerals have overprinted an earlier potassic alteration. Here, copper mineralization (average grade 0.17% Cu) is best developed in chloritic fractures and quartz veins. Within the B system, the fluids responsible for hydrothermal alteration became progressively less saline and to some extent cooler during the system's evolution. It is likely that ocean water played a significant role in the later stages of the B system. The gradual decrease in the K+/H+ ratio of the B system fluids is responsible for the observed alteration veinlet sequence : phlogopite-chlorite -> sericite. Peripheral vein assemblages of the B system were formed at lower temperatures than the final sericite and sericite-clay alteration within the center of the system. These peripheral assemblages are now composed mainly of poorly crystalline illite and interstratified illite-smectite. The final-stage veins consist of laumontite Â± smectite that postdate at least part of the B system and are widespread throughout the Koloula Igneous Complex. The solutions responsible for laumontite deposition were low temperature (-250Â°C) and water rich (XCO20.03). Electron probe studies of alteration minerals indicate that hydrothermal pyroxene, amphibole, and usually biotite are more magnesian and contain less Ti02 than primary (magmatic) mafic silicates from the same, or similar, rock types. Secondary biotites from the B system are progressively less magnesian and richer in octahedral aluminium with increasing distance from the center of the B alteration area. Secondary alkali feldspar from the A system is somewhat more sodic in the outer alteration zones than in the center of the system. Within the B system, illite crystallinity and molybdenite polytypism of samples are related to distance from the center of alteration. The compositions of chlorite (usually pycnochlorite or ripidolite), sericite, and epidote (22 to 30 mole % pistacite) are not related to spatial position within alteration zones but reflect the initial chemical composition of the rock or mineral which they have replaced.",
1260,"Characteristics of dissolved inorganic carbon in produced water from coalbed methane wells and its geological significance Based on long-term dynamic tracing of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13(DIC)) in produced water from 20 coalbed methane (CBM) wells in western Guizhou, the spatial-temporal dynamic variations of delta C-13(DIC) of the GP well group produced in multi-layer commingled manner were analyzed, and the relationship between the value of delta C-13(DIC) and CBM productivity was examined. The produced water samples of typical wells in the GP well group were amplified and sequenced using 16S rDNA, and a geological response model of delta C-13(DIC) in produced water from CBM wells with multi-coal seams was put forward. The research shows that: delta C-13(DIC) in produced water from medium-rank coal seams commonly show positive anomalies, the produced water contains more than 15 species of methanogens, and Methanobacterium is the dominant genus. The dominant methanogens sequence numbers in the produced water are positively correlated with delta C-13(DIC), and the positive anomaly of delta C-13(DIC) is caused by reduction of methanogens, and especially hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Vertical segmentation of sedimentary facies and lithology in stratum with multi-coal seams will result in permeability and water cut segmentation, which will lead to the segmentation of delta C-13(DIC) and archaea community in produced water, so in the strata with better permeability and high water cut, the delta C-13(DIC) of the produced water is abnormally enriched, and the dominant archaea is mainly Methanobacterium. In the strata with weak permeability and low water cut, the delta C-13(DIC) of the produced water is small, and the microbial action is weak. The shallow layer close to the coal seam outcrop is likely to be affected by meteoric precipitation, so the delta C-13(DIC) of the produced water is smaller. The geological response model of delta C-13(DIC) in produced water from multi-coal seams CBM wells in the medium-rank coal reveals the geological mechanism and microbial action mechanism of the delta C-13(DIC) difference in the produced water from the multi-coal seams CBM wells. It also provides effective geochemical evidence for the superimposed fluid system controlled by sedimentary facies, and can also be used for the contribution analysis of the produced gas and water by the multi-layer CBM wells.",
1261,"Bounds on the Time-history and Holocene Mass Budget of Antarctica from Sea-level Records in SE Tunisia Solving the sea-level equation for a Maxwell Earth, we analyze the sensitivity of Holocene sea-level records in SE Tunisia to the time-history of remote ice sheets. Assuming that mantle viscosity increases moderately with depth, we find that in this region the sea-level variations driven by the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets cancel, so that the late-Holocene sea-level high-stand suggested by the geological record merely reflects the melting history of Antarctica. New insight into the history of this ice sheet is obtained analyzing the information contained in a revised set of relative sea-level observations for sites across the Mediterranean covering the last 8 kyrs. From a trial-and-error misfit analysis, it holds true that in this region the match between model predictions and observations improves when the volume of water released from Antarctica is well below the value imposed by the ICE3G chronology and when a sudden meltwater pulse is allowed between 8 and 7 kyrs before present, corresponding to the epoch of the catastrophic rise event known as CRE3.",
1262,"Well productivity controlling factors in crystalline terrains of southeastern Brazil Over the last decades, increasing water demands have fostered research to obtain high well yields in crystalline terrains where, besides the intrinsic properties of rocks, the groundwater flow depends on several factors. The depth of the wells, the lithotypes, the presence and thickness of sedimentary coverings and weathered layers, the landforms, the geological structures, and the effects of tectonic stresses are among the most investigated factors considered as determinant of well productivity. The influence of these factors on productivity of wells that exploit the Crystalline Aquifer System in the Jundiai-River Catchment, southeastern Brazil, is investigated in this work. The largest region of the studied area is located on the Precambrian Basement, partially covered by sedimentary deposits. The results show that the sedimentary deposits and the weathered layer are important for high well yield, but it also depends on the existence of a net of open fractures, in order to maintain high productivity. The sites that have more possibility of occurrence of such structures are the regional shear and fault zones and other minor structures with NW-SE and E-W directions, which characterize areas subjected to transtensional stress related to the neotectonics.",
1263,"Stress testing of individual steel strands in a multiple-cable single borehole anchorage for geotechnical engineering Multiple-cable single borehole anchorages are widely used in China, accepted and regarded as a very effective method for slope protection, landslide remediation and foundation ditch support. This paper presents a new method for testing tensional stresses of individual steel strands within anchor cables in single boreholes. A rig has been designed to permit testing of cables within a single borehole, including two special features: a metal plate that distributes tension between strands of a cable and a sensing device that measures the stress in each individual strand. The feasibility of the method has been demonstrated by an in situ tensional stress test on anchor cables at a landslide remediation site that successfully measured the forces on individual steel strands fastened to different anchorage segments within a borehole. The steel cable strands displayed nonlinear extension characteristics; and the length of anchorage segments and grout strength met design criteria. The results confirm that this design of anchorage is satisfactory and can provide valuable data for future design and construction.",
1264,"Contamination by selected trace elements in groundwater in Azzaba, in Algeria. Population-based health risk assessment The various mineral index levels in the area around Azzaba, in northeastern Algeria, are classified as polymetallic (Pb, Zn, Cu) and mercury-polymetallic (Hg, Pb, Zn, Cu). The mercury layers in the area are located on the northern side of the limestone mountain chain south of Azzaba. There is a mercury factory in the area that is a potential source of environmental mercury pollution. The results of analyses on nine boreholes and two springs show high levels of the selected trace elements, in particular, Hg, Pb, and As, in the area groundwater. The mercury levels are excessively high - about 80 mu g.L-1. Lead and arsenic levels also exceed WHO standards. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to define homogeneous zones of contamination. The health risk assessment for the population living in the study area, according to RISC software, version 4, revealed an acceptable hazard index for Pb, but unacceptable levels for Hg and As, consumed or absorbed by cither children and adults. The carcinogenic risk of As is unacceptable for children, but somewhat less dangerous for adults.",1
1265,"Perspectives on impacts of water quality on agriculture and community well-beinga key informant study from Sri Lanka Integrated management of water quality is critical for sustaining food production and achieving overall well-being of a community. Further, understanding people's perceptions and engagement can play an important role in achieving water and food security. The main aim of this study was to investigate the perspectives of community and other stakeholders as to how water quality impacts on agriculture, livelihood and community well-being within rural farming communities of two dry zone districts of Sri Lanka. The study adopted key informant interviews' as the methodology to investigate community and other stakeholder perspectives to collect primary data over a period of four months. The interview contents were then examined using a frequency matrix and graphed using an Excel graphing tool. The raw text was also analysed to understand the broader patterns in the text. A fuzzy logic cognitive map (FCM) was developed using the relationships between various concepts and linkages provided by the key informants. All key informants were concerned with the quality of drinking water they consume and the water used for their food preparation. Key informants representing the farming community indicated that the use of poor quality groundwater with higher levels of hardness has made growing crops difficult in the region. The key informants also identified extensive and ongoing use of agro-chemicals and fertilisers as a major source of pollution in water bodies in both spatio-temporal scale. Based on key informant interviews, possible initiatives that can help improve surface water and groundwater qualities for both drinking and agricultural use in the dry zone of Sri Lanka can be categorised into four broader themes, viz., provision of filtering/treatment systems, reduction in the use of agro-chemical and fertilisers, education of community stakeholders and support of alternative options for portable water supplies. The study indicates that in the key informants' view of groundwater and surface waters' continued deterioration in the absence of a proper governance structure, a majority of farmers will have restricted access to good quality water to meet daily and agricultural needs, and this will affect the health of the elderly and children in the area. Further, a majority of key informants were of the view that management of surface water and groundwater should be a shared responsibility between the government and the community in the region and appropriate policy initiatives that will improve water literacy at all levels are mandatory to address future water quality challenges.",
1266,"Participatory Action Research in Marginalised Communities: Safe Drinking Water in Rural Bangladesh This paper provides an example of an application of participatory action research (PAR) to the current crisis of arsenic poisoning in rural Bangladesh. The approach was used to link the author's doctoral research with the work of the Arsenic Mitigation and Research Foundation (AMRF), a small group of researchers and practitioners involved in both research and implementation. Since 2001, we (the coordinators and staff of AMRF) set out to establish safe drinking water supplies in several marginalised and arsenic-affected communities-a matter of grave urgency after the discovery of arsenic in the groundwater more than 15 years ago. Millions of groundwater users are exposed and the implementation of solutions across Bangladesh is generally lacking or inadequate. Closely aligned with AMRFs aims, the general objectives of the author's doctoral research (2006-2009) were to better understand the situation, and to search for more adequate approaches. The research was predominantly informed by project activities on the ground and, in turn, this learning experience was fed back into our program to help guide new activities. Essentially, the author was involved both as an observer and practitioner. To fulfil this double role, PAR provides a potentially useful but also challenging methodology. This paper presents our experiences with PAR in the field; reflects on the value of its participative, qualitative and cyclical characteristics; and discusses some of the barriers that emerged in the process.",
1267,"Estimating nutrient releases from agriculture in China: an extended substance flow analysis framework and a modeling tool Agriculture related pollution has attracted the attention of policy makers as well as scientists in China as its contribution to water impairment has increased, and quantitative information at the national and regional levels is being sought to support decision making. However, traditional approaches are either time-consuming, expensive (e.g. national surveys) or oversimplified and crude (e.g. coefficient methods). Therefore, this study proposed an extended substance flow analysis (SFA) framework to estimate nutrient releases from agricultural and rural activities in China by depicting the nutrient flows in Chinese agro-ecosystems. The six-step process proposed herein includes: (a) system definition; (b) model development; (c) database development; (d) model validation; (e) results interpretation; and (f) uncertainty analysis. The developed Eubolism (Elementary Unit based nutrient Balance mOdeLIng in agro-ecoSysteM) model combined a nutrient balance module with an emission inventory module to quantify the nutrient flows in the agro-ecosystem. The model was validated and then applied to estimate the total agricultural nutrient loads, identify the contribution of different agricultural and rural activities and different land use types to the total loads, and analyze the spatial pattern of agricultural nutrient emissions in China. These results could provide an entire picture of agricultural pollution at the national level and be used to support policy making. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the structure of the elementary units, spatial resolution, and inputs/parameters were also analyzed to evaluate the robustness of the model results.",
1268,"Taxol, Camptothecin and Beyond for Cancer Therapy Plants produce a remarkably diverse array of metabolites, many of which have evolved to confer effectiveness against microbial attack, resist environmental stress or function as signalling molecules in interplant communication. Further, botanical preparations have been used for treating and preventing various human diseases throughout history. More than half of the current anti-cancer drugs in clinical use are natural products or their derivatives, and many are plant-derived agents. Two renowned examples of plant-based drugs used for humans are paclitaxel and camptothecin (CPT). Paclitaxel (taxol), originally identified from Pacific yew Taxus brevifolia Nutt, and its semi-synthesized analogues docetaxel (Taxotere), and CPT, originally identified from Camptotheca acuminata Decne, a native tree to China, as well as its more water-soluble derivatives topotecan (Hycamtin) and irinotecan or CPT-11 (Camptosar), are used as chemotherapeutic drugs for various cancers. This review offers a current and integrative account of the two representative chemotherapeutic phytoagents paclitaxel and CPT in terms of their discovery, development of authentic compounds and improvement by synthetic chemistry approaches, as well as their mechanisms of action and clinical applications. We also discuss the bench-side or clinically observed drug resistance and adverse side effects of both drugs, which are the major drawbacks to their use for cancer. Despite intensive efforts and substantial advances in improving treatment, cancer is still a life-threatening and leading cause of death, especially with recurring, metastatic or drug-resistant tumours. The successful experiences with the discovery and development of paclitaxel and CPT as anti-cancer drugs have been significant milestones for the design of alternative strategies and remedies from plant-derived agents in cancer management.",
1269,"Orexin type 1 receptor antagonism in Lateral Paragigantocellularis nucleus attenuates naloxone precipitated morphine withdrawal symptoms in rats Orexin neuropeptides have been reported to be involved in morphine induced physical dependence and withdrawal. The Lateral Paragigantocellularis (LPGi) is a key brain region implicated in the expression of somatic signs of morphine withdrawal syndrome. Orexin A and orexin type 1 receptor have been found in LPGi neurons but the effect of orexin on the expression of opiate dependence and withdrawal phenomena in this brain structure has not been studied yet. In this study, the effect of intra-LPGi administration of SB 334867 (selective orexin type 1 receptor antagonist) on the behavioral signs of morphine withdrawal syndrome was investigated. Male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were rendered dependent by adding morphine sulfate (Temad, Tehran, Iran) to their drinking water in increasing concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3mg/ml for every 48 h and 0.4 mg/ml during the next 15 days. Behavioral signs of morphine withdrawal were assessed in a transparent cylindrical Plexiglas test chamber (30 cm diameter, 50 cm height) for 25 min. One group of animals received intra-LPGi injection of SB 334867 (0.2 Î¼l, 100 Î¼M) immediately before naloxone. In the control group, SB-334867 vehicle (DMSO 1%, 0.2 Î¼l) was microinjected into LPGi. Our results indicate that intra-LPGi administration of SB 334867 significantly decreases naloxone precipitated morphine withdrawal signs. Thus, it seems that orexin might have a pivotal role in the expression of morphine withdrawal signs through affecting orexin type 1 receptor in LPGi nucleus.",
1270,"Numerical simulation of potential effects of CO(2) leakage on shallow potable aquifers Increased CO(2) release into the atmosphere has led to climate change, known as the greenhouse gas effect. Strategies are being sought to reduce the emissions, including the geological storage of CO(2), which is injection of supercritical CO(2) into deep geological formations. However; complete characterization of these geological formations is not possible, and the likelihood that some fraction of the injected CO(2), will leak into overlying aquifers needs to be considered. If the leaking CO(2), enters shallow groundwater aquifers, it could lead to geochemical alterations with detrimental effects on the water quality of these potable aquifers. Identification and assessment of the possible effects is necessary to adequately analyse the risks associated with geological storage of CO(2). In order to assess the possible geochemical reactions between water-rock-gas due to the leakage of CO(2) from deep formations into upper potable aquifers, a series of reactive geochemical transport simulations based on a 2-D model were performed using TOUGHREACT. Mineralogical composition and water chemistry data from a shallow formation of Jianghan basin in China were used. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of multi-phase processes, geochemical changes and mineral alterations on the water quality of shallow potable aquifers. Because the composition of the strata is not completely precise, a series of sensitivity simulations were performed, using different aquifer mineralogies and assumptions for geochemical system behaviour. The effect of CO(2) includes pH changes as well as the solubilization of primary minerals and precipitation of secondary minerals. The simulation results may be useful for preparation of CO(2) geological sequestration projects in China.",
1271,"Predicting taxonomic and functional structure of microbial communities in acid mine drainage Predicting the dynamics of community composition and functional attributes responding to environmental changes is an essential goal in community ecology but remains a major challenge, particularly in microbial ecology. Here, by targeting a model system with low species richness, we explore the spatial distribution of taxonomic and functional structure of 40 acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities across Southeast China profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and a comprehensive microarray (GeoChip). Similar environmentally dependent patterns of dominant microbial lineages and key functional genes were observed regardless of the large-scale geographical isolation. Functional and phylogenetic Î²-diversities were significantly correlated, whereas functional metabolic potentials were strongly influenced by environmental conditions and community taxonomic structure. Using advanced modeling approaches based on artificial neural networks, we successfully predicted the taxonomic and functional dynamics with significantly higher prediction accuracies of metabolic potentials (average Bray-Curtis similarity 87.8) as compared with relative microbial abundances (similarity 66.8), implying that natural AMD microbial assemblages may be better predicted at the functional genes level rather than at taxonomic level. Furthermore, relative metabolic potentials of genes involved in many key ecological functions (for example, nitrogen and phosphate utilization, metals resistance and stress response) were extrapolated to increase under more acidic and metal-rich conditions, indicating a critical strategy of stress adaptation in these extraordinary communities. Collectively, our findings indicate that natural selection rather than geographic distance has a more crucial role in shaping the taxonomic and functional patterns of AMD microbial community that readily predicted by modeling methods and suggest that the model-based approach is essential to better understand natural acidophilic microbial communities.",
1272,"Recent History Provides Sustainable African Water Quality Project Insight Small-scale projects to provide clean drinking water undertaken in the developing world can contribute to significantly improving the livelihood of rural communities. There has been a historical tendency to poorly plan such projects leading to an unsustainable future. Recent history indicates three simple steps to ensuring successful and enduring clean water projects. First, identification of need by the indigenous community provides ownership in the project. Second, a partnership between key individuals in the indigenous community with the donor provides for ambassadors on both sides of the project. Finally, an exit strategy by the donors for the indigenous communities ensures local sustainability for the future. The study site is the village of Geisha in northern Malawi, Africa. Sustainable implementation approaches are discussed in this case study as well as the various lessons learned. Improved project processes ensure sustainable small-scale water quality projects by donor organizations in developing countries.",
1273,"gamma-Al2O3-based nanocomposite adsorbents for arsenic(V) removal: Assessing performance, toxicity and particle leakage The generation and development of effective adsorption materials for arsenic removal are urgently needed due to acute arsenic contamination of water sources in many regions around the world. In the search for these new adsorbents, the application of nanomaterials or nanocomposites, and especially the use of nanoparticles (NPs), has proven increasingly attractive. While the adsorptive performance of a range of nanocomposite and nanomaterial-based systems has been extensively reviewed in previously-published literature, the stability of these systems in terms of NP release, i.e. the ability of the nanomaterial or nanocomposite to retain incorporated NPs, is less well understood. Here we examine the performance of nanocomposites comprised of aluminium oxide nanopartides (AluNPs) incorporated in macroporous polyacrylamide-based cryogels (n-Alu-cryo, where n indicates the percentage of AluNPs in the polymer material (n = 0-6%, w/v)) for As(V) adsorption, and evaluate AluNP leakage before and after the use of these materials. A range of techniques is utilised and assessed (SEM, TEM, mass weight change, PIXE and in vitro toxicity studies). The 4-Alu-cryo nanocomposite was shown to be optimal for minimising AluNP losses while maximising As(V) removal. From the same nanocomposite we were further able to show that NP losses were not detectable at the AluNP concentrations used in the study. Toxicity tests revealed that no cytotoxic effects could be observed. The cryogel-AluNPs composites were not only effective in As(V) removal but also in immobilising the AluNPs. More challenging flow-through conditions for the evaluation of NP leakage could be included as a next step in a continued study assessing particle loss and subsequent toxicity. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

1274,"Epidemiology of Schistosomiasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminth Coinfections among Schoolchildren Living in LambarÃ©nÃ©, Gabon Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection highly prevalent in Central Africa where it is co-endemic with many other parasitic infections, including soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). For its optimal control, there is a need of descriptive epidemiological data for each endemic region. The objective of the present study was to determine the epidemiological situation around schistosomiasis in LambarÃ©nÃ©, Gabon. A cross-sectional study was conducted among schoolchildren. One urine sample per day was collected on three consecutive days for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis using a urine filtration technique. One stool sample was collected for the detection of Schistosoma spp. and STH spp. eggs using the Kato-Katz technique, and for larvae, using the coproculture technique. A total of 614 schoolchildren were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of schistosomiasis and STH infections was 26% (159/614) and 15% (70/473), respectively. Human-freshwater contact was the main risk factor for schistosomiasis in the area (relative risk (RR) = 2.96 [2.20-4.00], P < 0.001). Hematuria (RR = 5.53 [4.30-7.10], P < 0.001) and proteinuria (RR = 2.12 [1.63-2.75], P < 0.001) as well as infection with Trichuris trichiura (RR = 1.86 [1.33-2.61], P = 0.002) and Ascaris lumbricoides (RR = 1.96 [1.19-3.21], P = 0.039) were associated with an increased risk of schistosomiasis. Trichuris trichiura was the highest prevalent STH species in the area. Our study reports a moderate prevalence for schistosomiasis with human-water contact as the main risk factor, whereas the prevalence of STH infections appears to be low. Our results stress the need for the implementation of WHO recommendations for schistosomiasis control.",
1275,"Evaluation of Drinking Water Quality in Rural Area of Amhara Region, Ethiopia: The Case of Mecha District This study was conducted to assess the drinking water quality of north Mecha district, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. 26 drinking water samples were collected from the water points of the dweller community in the dry seasons of 2020 and subjected to the analysis of physicochemical parameters, bacteriological parameters, and the level of trace metals. The analysis of physicochemical parameters and the trace metals was carried out following the standard procedures of the laboratory, and the bacteriological water qualities were measured using the membrane filtration method. The F-, NO3-, SO42-, and Cu levels of the water samples were within the permissible limits of the WHO and compulsory Ethiopian standard (CES). Depending on turbidity, 61.54% of the tested water samples crossed the WHO limit of drinking water quality, and 100% of the samples surpassed the limits of EPA. Based on iron and ammonia levels, 38.46%, and 100% of the studied water samples violated the environmental protection agency (EPA) guidelines; 23.07%, and 3.84%, of the samples surpassed the WHO and CES drinking water quality standards. In view of pH, 23.07% of the tested water samples were not within the safe limit of the WHO and CES. 92.31% of the studied water samples were not potable as coliform bacterium (thermo tolerant indicator bacterium) growth was detected. The study revealed that the water sources of the study area are not safe for drinking unless appropriate treatment measurements are taken. Higher values of water quality parameters for the water samples from Koga irrigation site than the values for the water samples from the study sites found out of the irrigation site indicated the pollution load of Koga irrigation on the water quality of the area.",1
1276,"ANAEROBIC TREATMENT OF DOMESTIC WASTE-WATER IN SMALL-SCALE UASB REACTORS A survey was made on the feasibility of on-site anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater from small scale emissions in The Netherlands. Three 1.2 m3 UASB-reactors (Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket) were tested in different rural locations. The survey made clear that the efficiency of the process is highly dependent on the reactor temperature. Below 12-degrees-C purification was predominantly based on settling, while above 12-degrees-C microbial degradation of organic matter increased. Efficiencies for the removal of total COD and BOD of two of the reactors ranged between 33 and 60%, equalising well performing septic tanks. In one of the reactors the average production of biogas, with a methane content of 78%, was 67 liters per day. Complete transformation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) into biogas was achieved during 3 to 4 months a year at temperatures above 15-degrees-C. In this period, during the second year of operation, the average efficiencies for COD and BOD removal were 60 and 72% respectively, while the maximum gas production reached 300 liters per day. In the latter period the mineralisation rate exceeded the input rate of organic matter, resulting in a decrease of settled material in the reactor. The possibility of high efficiencies during summertime in The Netherlands and the positive results of similar experiments in Indonesia and Latin America lead to the conclusion that anaerobic digestion is a promising process for the (pre-)treatment of domestic waste water in (sub)tropical countries.",
1277,"Energy production and sustainable energy policies in Turkey Turkey's demand for energy and electricity is increasing rapidly. Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy resources that place a big burden on the economy and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. Turkey's energy production meets nearly 28% of its total primary energy consumption. As would be expected, the rapid expansion of energy production and consumption has brought with it a wide range of environmental issues at the local, regional and global levels. With respect to global environmental issues, Turkey's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have grown along with its energy consumption. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey presently has considerable renewable energy sources. The most important renewable sources are hydropower, biomass, geothermal, solar and wind. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Turkey has a great and ever-intensifying need for power and water supplies and they also have the greatest remaining hydro potential. Hydropower and especially small hydropower are emphasized as Turkey's renewable energy sources. Turkey's hydro electric potential can meet 33-46% of its electric energy demand in 2020 and this potential may easily and economically be developed. This paper presents a review of the potential and utilization of the renewable energy sources in Turkey. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1278,"Cyanobacterial dominance in lakes Cyanobacterial dominance in lakes has received much attention in the past because of frequent bloom formation in lakes of higher trophic levels. In this paper, underlying mechanisms of cyanobacterial dominance are analyzed and discussed using both original and literature data from various shallow mixed and deep stratifying lakes from temperate and (sub)tropical regions. Examples include all four ecotypes of cyanobacteria sensu Mur et al. (1993), because their behavior in the water column is entirely different. Colony forming species (Microcystis) are exemplified from the large shallow Tai Hu, China. Data from a shallow urban lake, Alte Donau in Austria are used to characterize well mixed species (Cylindrospermopsis), while stratifying species (Planktothrix) are analyzed from the deep alpine lake Mondsee. Nitrogen fixing species (Aphanizomenon) are typified from a shallow river-run lake in Germany. Factors causing the dominance of one or the other group are often difficult to reveal because several interacting factors are usually involved which are not necessarily the same in different environments. Strategies for restoration, therefore, depend on both the cyanobacterial species involved and the specific causing situation. Some uncertainty about the success of correctives, however, will remain due to the stochastic nature of the events and pathways leading to cyanobacterial blooms. Truly integrated research programs are required to generate predictive models capable of quantifying key variables at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.",
1279,"Investigation of antimony, cobalt, and acetaldehyde migration into the drinking water in Turkey Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used material for the packaging of drinking water. The development of this research arises from the demand of a popular Turkish drinking water company, which has reported odour problems in their PET bottled products. Acetaldehyde, cobalt, and antimony contents were determined in bottled water of different volumes (0.5, 1.5, and 5 L), PET bottles, plastic blue closures, and preform material by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Antimony, cobalt, and acetaldehyde migration into the drinking water (PET bottled) was tracked for every 2 months through a year. Migration of these compounds rose with increased storage time at 20 degrees C. The highest amounts of migrated compounds were observed in 0.5 L (smallest) of PET bottles. All migration results were found to be under the migration limit at the end of storage period. In addition to these findings, nonintentionally added substances (NIASs) analyses were performed by headspace (HS)/GC-MS. Odour-active compounds were identified using the library database. Off-odours in the drinking water were due to the migration of various compounds such as acetaldehyde and other NIASs from PET bottle into the drinking water. In addition, acetaldehyde amounts were ranged from 0 to 140 mu g/L in all drinking waters, and some acetaldehyde values were above the taste threshold of 15 mu g/L.",1
1280,"Effects of extreme rainstorms on the export of diffuse pollution from an agricultural watershed in eastern China Agriculture is an important contributor to diffuse pollution in the aquatic environment system. The exact transfer of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in an agriculturally dominated area is still poorly understood. Export of pollutants shows significant spatial and temporal variation and the relevant factors are complex and nonlinear in nature. There has been a dramatic increase of synthetic fertilizer usage in southern China during recent decades due to decreasing farmland and increasing food demand. Massive N and P fertilizer application has led to many environmental problems, especially eutrophication. Research has shown that extreme rainstorms will increase in frequency with climate change. The objective of this study is to examine the diffuse agricultural pollution transfer at the watershed-scale and field-scale through event-based, on-site observation and sampling. Seven years of experiments carried out in Meilin watershed demonstrate the export of significant quantities of nutrients during high intensity rainstorms. Based on detailed field experiments, the N and P transfer in different seasons and land covers is described.",
1281,"Assessment of Long-Term Evolution of Groundwater Hydrochemical Characteristics Using Multiple Approaches: A Case Study in Cangzhou, Northern China Water shortage is severe in the North China Plain (NCP). In addition to a deficiency of water resources, deterioration of groundwater quality should be of great concern. In this study, hydrogeological analysis was conducted in combination with principal component analysis, correlation analysis and the co-kriging method to identify factors controlling the content of major ions and total dissolved solids (TDS) in areal shallow and deep groundwater and to assess groundwater evolution in Cangzhou, China. The results suggested that groundwater quality degradation occurred and developed in the study area, as indicated by increasing concentrations of major ions, TDS and hardness in both shallow and deep groundwater. In shallow groundwater, whose hydrochemical water types changed from HCO3-Ca.Na.Mg and HCO3.Cl-Na in the west (Zone II) to Cl.SO4-Na and Cl-Na in the east (Zone III). Areas with TDS concentrations between 1500 and 2000 mg/L occupied 79.76% of the total in the 1980s, while areas with a TDS concentration ranging from 2500 to 3000 mg/L comprised 59.11% of the total in the 2010s. In deep groundwater, the area with TDS over 1000 mg/L expanded from 5366.39 km(2) in the 1960s to 7183.52 km(2) in the 2010s. Natural processes (water-rock interactions) and anthropogenic activities (groundwater exploitation) were the dominant factors controlling the major ions' content in local groundwater. Dissolution of dolomite, calcite, feldspar and gypsum were the primary sources of major ions in groundwater, and the ion exchange reaction had a strong effect on the cation content, especially for deep groundwater.",
1282,"A proposed framework for the management of water quality in arid-region lakes For arid-region lakes, management conflicts are likely to occur between quantity and quality of water supplied: increasing quantity of water supply can lead to water quality deterioration. Such conflicts can best be resolved within an effective management program based on awareness and cooperation at all levels of water management from policy makers to experts. We propose a general framework for designing effective water resource management programs for lakes based on concrete definitions of management criteria such as water quality. The proposed system requires close interaction between policy makers, water resource managers, water suppliers and users, hydrological engineers and limnologists. The significance of mathematical modeling as a self-organizing tool of the management program is emphasized, especially with regards to designing limnological investigations directed toward lake management. We illustrate the application of this approach to water resource management in arid-region lakes (Lake Kinneret, Israel and Lake Sevan, Armenia), where artificial variability of lake morphometry due to water use is a forcing function affecting water qualify.",
1283,"Factors Affecting Differential Methylation of DNA Promoters in Arsenic-Exposed Populations The exposure/biotransformation of inorganic arsenic (iAs) may perturb DNA methylation patterns and subsequently influence disease risk by altering the expression of key genes. Interindividual variation in patterns of DNA methylation can be explained by the influence of environmental, genetic, and stochastic factors. Here, we examined promoter DNA methylation levels with urinary arsenical concentrations and investigated the genetic and nongenetic determinants of DNA methylation in 105 samples collected from populations in Shanxi Province, China, with high levels of arsenic in drinking water. Arsenic concentrations in water were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA-6800, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). Urine samples were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with an arsenic speciation pretreatment system (ASA-2sp, Shimadzu Co. Kyoto, Japan) for detection. Gene-specific (CDH1, EREG, ERCC2, GSTP1, and MGMT) DNA methylation was quantified by targeted bisulfite sequencing. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using a custom-by-design 2â€‰Ã—â€‰48-Plex SNPscanâ„¢ Kit. These results revealed CDH1 with promoter DNA methylation levels associated with iAs. After the exclusion of confounding factors, age was correlated with increased methylation of the CDH1 gene. The susceptibility of the CDH1 and GSTP1 gene promoters to methylation was increased in individuals carrying the DNMT3B (SNP rs2424932) GA genotype, and the susceptibility of the CDH1 gene promoters to methylation was increased in individuals carrying the DNMT3B (SNP rs6087990) TC genotype. Although the above results must still be replicated in larger samples, the findings improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of arsenic and may highlight certain DNA methylation markers as attractive surrogate markers for prevention research.",1
1284,"Adsorptive amputation of hazardous azo dye Congo red from wastewater: a critical review Increasing amount of dyes in an ecosystem has propelled the search of various methods for dye removal. Amongst all the methods, adsorption occupies a prominent place in dye removal. Keeping this in mind, many adsorbents used for the removal of hazardous anionic azo dye Congo red (CR) from aqueous medium were reviewed by the authors. The main objectives behind this review article are to assemble the information on scattered adsorbents and enlighten the wide range of potentially effective adsorbents for CR removal. Thus, CR sorption by various adsorbents such as activated carbon, non-conventional low-cost materials, nanomaterials, composites and nanocomposites are surveyed and critically reviewed as well as their sorption capacities are also compared. This review also explores the grey areas of the adsorption performance of various adsorbents with reference to the effects of pH, contact time, initial dye concentration and adsorbent dosage. The equilibrium adsorption isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic data of different adsorbents used for CR removal were also analysed. It is evident from a literature survey of more than 290 published papers that nanoparticle and nanocomposite adsorbents have demonstrated outstanding adsorption capabilities for CR.

1285,"Health risk related to radon in a thermal spa utilizing waters from Guarani aquifer This investigation was carried out within the Parana sedimentary basin, Brazil, involved the sampling of groundwater and air, and was realized with the purpose of evaluating the radioactivity, due to radon gas, in a thermal spa utilizing the waters from Guarani (Botucatu-Piramboia) aquifer. The results reported here provide additional information relative to that of previous studies focusing on the presence of radionuclides in the aquifer, which have mainly characterized those belonging to uranium and thorium series decay, such as the uranium isotopes (U-238 and U-234), radium isotopes (Ra-226 and Ra-228), radon daughters (Bi-214 and Pb-214) and radon (Rn-222) itself The results obtained were compared with the maximum permissible concentration limits in air and drinking water defined by international standards, such as the guidelines for drinking water quality established by the World Health Organization. The possible processes responsible for the presence of radon in the aquifer were also considered in order to evaluate the data obtained.",
1286,"Element composition of soils to assess the success of wetland restoration The main purpose of this study is to assess if wetland restoration is associated with a directional shift in soil element concentration toward the original prefarming status in the peatlands of northeastern China. The concentrations of 55 soil elements and related environmental factors including organic matter content, electrical conductivity, and pH were investigated in natural, restored, and farmed wetlands in the Xingkai Lake Watershed of northeastern China. All but four of the soil element concentrations varied by wetland type (natural, restored, and farmed wetlands), and the soil concentrations of 41 elements increased from natural to restored to farmed wetlands. Soil organic matter and electrical conductivity explained 87.8% and 3.3% of the variation in element concentration based on ordination analysis using redundancy analysis. Both nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis and cluster analysis indicated that the restored wetlands had a higher similarity with the farmed wetlands than the natural wetlands. Our findings suggest that restoration led to an increase in soil organic matter content and shifts in level of element concentration that was more similar to natural wetlands. However, differences remained so that the biogeochemistry of restored wetlands was not the same as the original prefarming level. This information is very important for wetland restoration, because to be successful, not only biodiversity and hydrology, but also the soil element composition and biogeochemistry need to be restored. Our approach can be used to assess the success of wetland restoration.",
1287,"Role of small-scale independent providers in water and sanitation Small-scale independent providers (SSIPs) and households are good for 10-69% of the household water supply and sometimes up to 95% of the sanitation solutions in cities in developing countries. Different types of SSIP can be distinguished. They could be allowed to make a more important contribution to drinking water and sanitation in a situation where many governments cannot be the only one to supply drinking water and sanitary services. Theoretical and practical arguments are used to explain why private sector involvement is even more frequent in sanitation than in drinking water. The issue of how to improve the efficiency in the water and sanitation sector will be raised by looking at ways to unbundle sanitation, to use technological innovations and to bring in more competition. The need for alternative technologies is stressed, since a fully fledged sewerage system in every Third World city would contribute to increased foreign debt in many countries, given that the steel and cement often need to be imported.

1288,"Dobrogea: Movile Cave Movile Cave (SE Romania) is the first known subterranean chemosynthesis-based ecosystem. Sulfur-and methane-oxidizing, as well as nitrifying microorganisms, form the base of the food web in this peculiar ecosystem. The bacteria use mainly oxygen from the cave's atmosphere as electron acceptor to oxidize H2S, CH4, and NH4+, which originate from the deep thermomineral aquifer. These microorganisms form microbial mats that cover the water surface and the cave walls adjacent to the water. For cave standards, this is an unusually abundant primary production that allows 51 invertebrates species to thrive here. Of these, 35 are endemic to this ecosystem and display advanced troglomorphy. Numerous aquatic and terrestrial species graze on the rich microbial mats present in the lower sections of the cave, while others predate on protozoa and smaller invertebrates. Speleogenesis in the Movile Cave area was initiated in the Late Miocene and continues today by the action of the sulfuric acid resulted from the oxidation of sulfide in the lower part of the cave. The cave was sealed off during the Quaternary by thick and impermeable layers of clays and loess.",
1289,"Arsenic(V) removal from aqueous solutions using ferromagnetic activated carbon: Equilibrium and kinetic studies Arsenic pollution is one of the global issues which affect the drinking water supply in Burkina Faso, mainly in rural areas. To mitigate this water pollution, ferromagnetic activated carbon (FAC) has been prepared by chemical activation using rice husk and iron chloride solution to be used as an adsorbent of arsenic. Characterization with some analytical techniques revealed this carbon is microporous with a specific surface area of 150 m2âˆ™g-1 and ferromagnetic properties. This work aims to evaluate the equilibrium conditions of As(V) removal and the adsorption capacity of FAC. Batch experiments were undertaken to evaluate the performance of FAC for arsenic removal under various operating conditions and the mechanism of the removal process. Results showed an increase of the removal percentage with the increase of the contact time, indicating a saturation during 60 min. The removal of As(V) is influenced by the increase of the initial arsenic concentration causing an increase of the adsorption capacity of FAC. The increase of pH showed a variation of the removal percentage indicating a maximum removal at pH 7 which corresponds to an adsorption capacity of 153 Âµgâˆ™g-1. Both monolayer adsorption and ion exchange constitute the mechanism of removal of As(V) using FAC. The kinetics of the process is described by a pseudo-second order model.

1290,"Leaf CO(2) exchange of Erythrina poeppigiana (Leguminosae: Phaseolae) in humid tropical field conditions An idealized model was developed to describe leaf CO(2) exchange in the leguminous tree Erythrina poeppigiana (Walpers) O.F. Cook under well-watered field conditions. Photosynthetic rate in mature leaves (p) was modeled as a rectangular hyperbolic function of photon flux density (q) and ambient CO(2) concentration (c(a)), relative photosynthetic capacity (pi) was modeled as a logistic s-function of leaf age (l(a)), metabolic dark respiration rate (r(m)) was modeled as an exponential function of leaf temperature (T(l)), and photorespiration rate (r(p)) was modeled as a hyperbolic function of c(a). Assimilation rate (a(c)) was modeled as the difference between the product of p and pi and the sum of r(m) and r(p): a(c) = p(q,c(a))pi(l(a)) - [r(m)(T(l)) + r(p)(c(a))]. The model parameters were estimated separately for five sources of E. poeppigiana (Clones 2660, 2662, 2687 and 2693 and half-sib Family 2431) from field data measured with a portable closed-loop gas exchange system at a humid tropical site in Costa Rica. The between-source differences in leaf CO(2) exchange characteristics were small, but statistically significant. Aboveground biomass production was highest in sources that maintained high relative photosynthetic capacity throughout the leaf life span. Quantum yield varied between 0.046 and 0.067, and light-saturated assimilation rate (q = 2000 micro mol m(-2) s(-1) and T(l) = 28 degrees C) at natural atmospheric c(a) (350 micro mol mol(-1)) was 16.8-19.9 micro mol m(-2) s(-1). Increasing c(a) to 1000 micro mol mol(-1) resulted in an approximate doubling of the light-saturated assimilation rate. Foliole nitrogen concentration, which was 45.3-51.2 mg g(-1) in mature leaves, was positively correlated with relative photosynthetic capacity. Foliole nitrogen concentration, quantum yield and maximum assimilation rate of E. poeppigiana are among the highest values observed in tropical woody legumes.",
1291,"Role of Aspergillus niger acrA in arsenic resistance and its use as the basis for an arsenic biosensor Arsenic contamination of groundwater sources is a major issue worldwide, since exposure to high levels of arsenic has been linked to a variety of health problems. Effective methods of detection are thus greatly needed as preventive measures. In an effort to develop a fungal biosensor for arsenic, we first identified seven putative arsenic metabolism and transport genes in Aspergillus niger, a widely used industrial organism that is generally regarded as safe (GRAS). Among the genes tested for RNA expression in response to arsenate, acrA, encoding a putative plasma membrane arsenite efflux pump, displayed an over 200-fold increase in gene expression in response to arsenate. We characterized the function of this A. niger protein in arsenic efflux by gene knockout and confirmed that AcrA was located at the cell membrane using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fusion construct. Based on our observations, we developed a putative biosensor strain containing a construct of the native promoter of acrA fused with egfp. We analyzed the fluorescence of this biosensor strain in the presence of arsenic using confocal microscopy and spectrofluorimetry. The biosensor strain reliably detected both arsenite and arsenate in the range of 1.8 to 180 Î¼g/liter, which encompasses the threshold concentrations for drinking water set by the World Health Organization (10 and 50 Î¼g/liter).",
1292,"High-performance magnetic carbon materials in dye removal from aqueous solutions To obtain a novel adsorbent with excellent adsorption capacity and convenient magnetic separation property, magnetic activated semi-coke was prepared by KOH activation method and further modified by FeCl3. The surface morphology, physical structure, chemical properties and textural characteristics of unmodified semi-coke, KOH-modified semi-coke and magnetic activated semi-coke were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption measurement, and electronic differential system. The adsorption characteristics of the magnetic activated semi-coke were explored for the removal of methyl orang (MO), methylene blue (MB), congo red (CR), acid fuchsin (AF), and rhodamine B (RB) from aqueous solution. The effects of adsorption parameters, including adsorbent dosage, pH and contact time, were investigated by comparing the adsorption properties of the magnetic activated semi-coke to RB. The result showed that the magnetic activated semi-coke displayed excellent dispersion, convenient separation and high adsorption capacity. The adsorption experiment data indicated that the pseudosecond order model and the Langmuir model could well explain the adsorption processes of RB on the magnetic activated semi-coke, and the maximum adsorption capacity (q(m)) was 526.32 mg/g. The values of thermodynamic parameters (Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees) indicated that the adsorption process depended on the temperature of the aqueous phase, and it was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. As the addition of the magnetic activated semi-coke, the color of the solution significantly faded. Subsequently, fast aggregation of the magnetic activated semi-coke from their homogeneous dispersion in the presence of an external magnetic field could be happened. So, the magnetic activated semi-coke displayed excellent dispersion, convenient separation and high adsorption capacity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

These maps, depth to the groundwater, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity are established and overlaid in GIS for the area. The overlaid (DRASTIC index) map indicates high vulnerability potential at central areas of the city. Groundwater samples are collected from different vulnerable areas.

The model is a useful and correct technique for assessing the aquifer safety.",1
1294,"Distribution of Available Silicon of Volcanic Ash Soils in Jeju Island In soils, dissolved silicon (Si) is adsorbed onto soil particles or is leached into groundwater through the soil profile. Andisols may play an important role in contributing to high dissolved Si concentrations in groundwater on Jeju Island, Korea. In this study, we evaluated the available Si content that potentially affects groundwater composition and investigated the relationship between the available Si content and chemical properties of volcanic ash soil on Jeju Island. We used the 1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) to extract the available Si. Selected chemical properties were determined for 290 topsoil samples collected from different land sites throughout Jeju Island, and we analyzed the available Si content in the typifying pedons of Jeju Island and mainland Korea. The available Si content in Jeju Island topsoils ranged from 75 to 150 mg center dot kg(-1), and the available Si content of Andisols in both orchards and grasslands was significantly higher than that of non-Andisols. The available Si content was highly correlated with the amounts of oxalate extractable Si, Al, and Fe in Andisols and was negatively related to the Al-p/Al-o ratio. With increasing elevation, we detected a decrease in the available Si and allophane content in Andisols, whereas Al-humus complexes increased with increasing elevation. The ratio of available Si in the lowest subsoil/topsoil increased to a value of 6.0, indicating that large amounts of available Si are present in the subsoil. The available Si content in the lowest subsoil of Andisols on Jeju Island was 10 times higher than that in the typifying pedons of the Korean mainland. In contrast, there were no differences in the available Si content between the topsoil and the subsoil of the typifying pedon series of Jeju and mainland non-Andisols because of differences in pedogenic processes. Collectively, our findings indicate that weathering of Andisols on Jeju Island potentially affects the Si concentration in groundwater.",
1295,"Improved Forecasting of Extreme Monthly Reservoir Inflow Using an Analogue-Based Forecasting Method: A Case Study of the Sirikit Dam in Thailand Reservoir inflow forecasting is crucial for appropriate reservoir management, especially in the flood season. Forecasting for this season must be sufficiently accurate and timely to allow dam managers to release water gradually for flood control in downstream areas. Recently, several models and methodologies have been developed and applied for inflow forecasting, with good results. Nevertheless, most were reported to have weaknesses in capturing the peak flow, especially rare extreme flows. In this study, an analogue-based forecasting method, designated the variation analogue method (VAM), was developed to overcome this weakness. This method, the wavelet artificial neural network (WANN) model, and the weighted mean analogue method (WMAM) were used to forecast the monthly reservoir inflow of the Sirikit Dam, located in the Nan River Basin, one of the eight sub-basins of the Chao Phraya River Basin in Thailand. It is one of four major dams in the Chao Phraya Basin, with a maximum storage of 10.64 km(3), which supplies water to 22 provinces in this basin, covering an irrigation area of 1,513,465 hectares. Due to the huge extreme monthly inflow in August, with inflow of more than 3 km(3) in 1985 and 2011, monthly or longer lead time inflow forecasting is needed for proper water and flood control management of this dam. The results of forecasting indicate that the WANN model provided good forecasting for whole-year forecasting including both low-flow and high-flow patterns, while the WMAM model provided only satisfactory results. The VAM showed the best forecasting performance and captured the extreme inflow of the Sirikit Dam well. For the high-flow period (July-September), the WANN model provided only satisfactory results, while those of the WMAM were markedly poorer than for the whole year. The VAM showed the best capture of flow in this period, especially for extreme flow conditions that the WANN and WMAM models could not capture.",
1296,"Jute cellulose nanocrystal/poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-3-methacryloxypropyltrimethox ysilane) hybrid hydrogels for removing methylene blue dye from aqueous solution Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) extracted from jute fibers are moderately high in length (up to 1200 nm) and diameter (up to 90 nm). Poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) (pSiDm) is a custom made copolymer with trimethoxy silane groups at one end which facilitates to react with cellulose in an aqueous solution. A very simple, efficient, rapid, and eco-friendly method was developed to prepare j-CNC reinforced pSiDm hydrogel to remove methylene blue (MB) dye from an aqueous solution. The reaction between j-CNCs and pSiDm in the hydrogel was revealed by the increased intensity ratio of -OH band to C-H band and shifting of a peak for C=O from 1604 cm(-1) to 1608 cm (-1) in the FT-IR spectrum of the hydrogel compared to those of the copolymer. Glass transition temperature of the copolymer increases from 99 to 111 degrees C after being applied into the hydrogel. The prepared hydrogel showed a significant swelling at a ratio of 16 g/g in deionized water. In good accordance with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, a maximum adsorption value of MB onto the hydrogel was achieved 131.58 mg/g. Kinetic studies of the adsorption process fit well with a pseudo-second-order reaction model. The j-CNCs/pSiDm hydrogel is a moderately resilient and completely biodegradable material to be utilized for the adsorption of cationic toxic materials from waste effluent. (C) 2021 The Authors.

1297,"Scenario, perspectives and mechanism of arsenic and fluoride Co-occurrence in the groundwater: A review Arsenic (As) and fluoride (F-) are the two most conspicuous contaminants, in terms of distribution and menace, in aquifers around the world. While the majority of studies focus on the individual accounts of their hydro-geochemistry, the current work is an effort to bring together the past and contemporary works on As and E co-occurrence. Co-occurrence in the context of As and F- is a broad umbrella term and necessarily does not imply a positive correlation between the two contaminants. In arid oxidized aquifers, healthy relationships between As and F- is reported owing desorption based release from the positively charged (hydr)oxides of metals like iron (Fe) under alkaline pH. In many instances, multiple pathways of release led to little or no correlation between the two, yet there were high concentrations of both at the same time. The key influencer of the strength of the co-occurrence is seasonality, environment, and climatic conditions. Besides, the existing primary ion and dissolved organic matter also affect the release and enrichment of As-F- in the aquifer system. Anthropogenic forcing in the form of mining, irrigation return flow, extraction, recharge, and agrochemicals remains the most significant contributing factor in the co-occurrence. The epidemiological indicate that the interface of these two interacting elements concerning public health is considerably complicated and can be affected by some uncertain factors. The existing explanations of interactions between As-F are indecisive, especially their antagonistic interactions that need further investigation. ""Multi-contamination perspectives of groundwater"" is an essential consideration for the overarching question of freshwater sustainability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1298,"Implementing biological control technology into the management of alien invasive weeds: South African experiences and challenges Since its inauguration in 1913, biological control of alien invasive plants has had an excellent track record in South Africa, but has rarely solved alien plant problems in isolation of other methods. However, biological control agents, notably insects, mites and pathogens, can augment the efficacy of conventional control methods if they are implemented and integrated appropriately. South Africa's 'Working for Water' (WFW) Programme, a national initiative geared towards the mechanical and chemical removal of alien plants from catchments and other water resources, has recognized the importance of biocontrol in sustaining progress over the long-term. Consequently, a National Biological Control Implementation Strategy (NBCIS) was formulated in 2000 and will be focused on (i) mass production and releases of new and poorly established biocontrol agents, (ii) collection and redistribution of well-established and effective agents, (iii) monitoring of the agents' establishment and assessments of their impact, and (iv) national co-ordination of the strategy. Challenges facing the NBCIS include (i) training and technology transfer to resolve practical problems, (ii) appropriate integration of control methods, (iii) conservation of biocontrol agents, and (iv) initiating preemptive biocontrol programmes. The potential savings to the WFW Programme, should biocontrol be implemented to its full potential, has been estimated at 59% of the total clearing costs (i.e. around 1480 million), while the agricultural and environmental benefits are considerable.",
1299,"Breakthrough pressure and permeability in partially water-saturated shales using methane-carbon dioxide gas mixtures: An experimental study of Carboniferous shales from the eastern Qaidam Basin, China As an important unconventional and alternative resource, shale gas has attracted worldwide attention. The breakthrough pressure is a major factor in the generation and migration of shale gas as well as in the evaluation of the caprock sealing capacity. Carboniferous shales are considered to have great potential for the exploitation of shale gas; thus, investigations of the breakthrough pressure and gas effective permeability are significant. Two shale samples taken from the Carboniferous Hurleg Formation in the eastern Qaidam Basin, China, were chosen to conduct breakthrough experiments to investigate the effects of water saturation and CO2-CH4 mixed mole fractions on the breakthrough pressure and gas effective permeability. Prior to the experiments, various relevant parameters (e.g., the porosity, mineral composition, and organic geochemistry; the total organic content, thermal maturity and kerogen type; and microstructure) of these samples were also measured. The results of our breakthrough experiments show that the breakthrough pressure increases with the water saturation and decreases with the CO2 mole fraction in the gas mixture. The situation for the gas effective permeability is just the opposite. Pore-size distribution measurements indicate that there are many nanoscale micropores that can easily be blocked by water molecules. This results in the reduced connectivity of gas pathways; thus, the breakthrough pressure increases and the gas effective permeability decreases with increasing water saturation. The breakthrough pressure decreases with the CO2 mole fraction because the interfacial tension of the CO2-water system is smaller than that of the CH4-water system. The viscosity of the CO2-CH4 mixture was found to increase with the CO2 mole fraction by fitting a series of values under the same temperature and pressure conditions, leading to an increase in the gas effective permeability. Furthermore, CO2 molecules are smaller than CH4 molecules, making it easier for CO2 to move across pathways. After each breakthrough experiment, the CO2 mole fraction in the effluent was less than that in the injected gas, and it increased over time until reaching the initial injected gas composition. This is because the adsorption and solubility of CO2 in water are greater than those of CH4. This study provides practical information for further investigations of shale gas migration and extraction and the sealing capacities of caprocks.",

1301,"[Optimization and Validation of the Analytical Method to Detect New Psychoactive Substances in Wastewater] New psychoactive substances (NPS) are emerging continuously, as the crackdown against traditional drugs becomes stricter. Metabolites of NPSs and the unchanged drugs enter wastewater through urine and are collected and treated by wastewater treatment plants before being discharged into the aquatic environment. Based on previous research, solid phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were used and the detection method of 11 NPSs was optimized. Influences of wastewater pretreatment procedures, including SPE columns; pH values of water samples; and processes of flushing and redissolving on NPS recoveries were compared. It was shown that the best recovery was achieved when Oasis MCX columns were used and the pH value of wastewater samples was adjusted to 2. A flushing process with 2 mL water at pH=2 followed by 2 mL methanol was needed. Redissolution of the residue after evaporation was best achieved with 400 Î¼L of a 20% methanol water solution. It was indicated by retention times, recoveries, matrix effects, limits of detection, limits of quantification, as well as precision that C18-UPLC-MS/MS and the optimized method are efficient and valid. Influent and effluent samples from 11 municipal wastewater treatment plants in Beijing were analyzed using the optimized method for validation. The validated method can be used as an important reference for monitoring NPSs via wastewater-based epidemiology and for assessing the risk of NPS abuse in China.",
1302,"V/Sc as a new geochemical tool to fingerprint the magmatic differentiation processes in the formation of the protoliths for the CCSD eclogites V and Sc, same as Fe, are transitional metals. The behavior and systematics of V and Sc in partial melting of upper mantle and magma differentiation has been a focus of recent advanced planetary and petro-geoehemical studies. These studies have greatly advanced our knowledge of the geochemical behavior of V and Se in mantle melting and magma differentiation, and show that V/Sc ratio can see through metamorphism, metasomatism, and fluid-rock reaction. Therefore, V/Sc systematics offers us another powerful tool to unravel magmatic processes that were responsible for the formation of protolith for high-grade metabasites. The 540 similar to 600 m eclogites in the CCSD main borehole are extraordinary in that they have anomalous high magnetic susceptibility, high P-wave velocity, and geochemistry. Petrography and mineral chemistry on these rocks show that opaque phases in these rocks are dominantly of ilmenite-haematite solid solution with very fine intergrowth structures. Such intergrowths can amount up to 30 vol% of mineral compositions of these eclogites. Major and trace element geochemical data show that as compared to the other types of eclogites, they have: (1) relatively high V with an average of 606 ppm, but very low Nb and Ta; (2) highest TFeO, Fe2O3/FeO ratio, and highly variable but strong positive Eu anomalies with Eu/Eu* up to 2.9; (3) anomalously high V/Sc ratios ranging from 8.39 to 43.23, average 15.03. V/Se ratios are correlated negatively with MgO, but positively with Fe2O3/FeO ratios; (4) nearly in-phase correlation of V with Fe2O3/FeO ratios, but anti-phase with Eu/Eu*. These data suggest a highly negative feedback between dynamic fractional crystallization of plagioclase and fO(2) in the fractionated magma during the formation of the protolith of 540 similar to 600m eclogite. Plagioclase fractional crystallization from a basaltic magma elevated the fO(2) in the magma to a level at which crystallization of Ti-Fe-bearing oxides together with plagioclase and clinopyroxene started. In turn, crystallization of Ti-Fe-bearing oxides reduced fO(2) in the magma to a level at which Ti-Fe-bearing oxide crystallization stopped. Repetition of such a cycle could explain the observed in phase correlation of V with Fe2O3/FeO, as well as anti-phase correlation between V and Eu/Eu*. V/Se and MgO systematics in the 100 similar to 600 m eclogites also support such a mechanism. The suggested mechanism is extremely similar to processes responsible for the formation of large-scale layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions such as Skaergaard, Bushveld, and Stillwater. The layered intrusion identified in the CCSD project may represent a least destructed of many unidentified layered intrusions in the Dabie-Sulu UHP metamorphic belt.",
1303,"PHYSIOLOGY AND YIELD OF PIEL DE SAPO MELON (Cucumis melo L.) UNDER WATER DEFICIT IN SEMI-ARID REGION, BRAZIL Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is a crop of great socioeconomic importance in regions with semiarid climate, as found in Northeast Brazil. In this region water deficit is a usual condition as well as the main reduction factor of plant productivity. Due to this phenomenon, irrigation techniques are used to make available the amount of water needed for plant production. Therefore, this study evaluated the physiology and fruit production changes of 'Juazeiro' Piel de sapo melon plants under different water replacement rates. 'Juazeiro' melon was grown under four reference evapotranspiration replacement rates (40, 60, 80 and 100% of ETo) distributed randomly in blocks with 5 replicates. The plants were cultivated in the field, in an experimental area located in the Brazilian Northeast region, under hot and dry semiarid climatic conditions, and during the growing cycle the 'Juazeiro' hybrid melon plants were evaluated for leaf area, biomass accumulation, gas exchange, photochemical efficiency of photosystem PSII and production of fruits per plant. Application of water replacement rates of 100% ETo leads to highest growth, net photosynthesis, and fruit yield of 'Juazeiro' melon. Water replacement at 80% ETo can be used for 'Juazeiro"" melon under semiarid climatic conditions, but with small losses in fruit yield. Water replacement below 80% ETo leads to drastic reductions in growth, gas exchanges, quantum efficiency of photosystem II and fruit yield, which impairs melon production in semi-arid climate environments.",
1304,"GENETIC IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY OF PROCAMBARUS LLAMASI (DECAPODA, ASTACIDAE, CAMBARINAE) FROM THE YUCATAN PENINSULA, MEXICO Two species of cambarids have been reported for the Yucatan Peninsula, Procambarus llamasi and P pilosimanus, the latter with a distribution that stretches from the south of Veracruz to the south of Campeche However, during the last decade only the presence of P llamasi has been reported; as a consequence, and also because of the biogeographic isolation of the Laguna de Chichancanab, we here investigated two southern populations, Procambarus sp. from Laguna de Chichancanab, Quintana Roo (LCh) and Procambarus llamasi from Ignacio Zaragoza, Campeche (IZa). We investigated these at the molecular level in order to determine if they are independent genetic units. The levels of genetic heterogeneity of the mitochondrial r16S and subunit I of the cytochrome oxidase (CO-I) genes are thus evaluated and contrasted to the levels of the cambarellinid, Cambarellus montezumae from the Xochimilco Channels, D.F. (XCh). The phylogenetic relations of these populations in relation to other Neartic and Neotropical astacoids (Astacidae and Cambaridae) and Caribbean atyids (Atyidae) were investigated. Levels of genetic diversity (h and pi) in both r16S and CO-I were lower in the southeastern populations in relation to the Cambarellinae from central Mexico. For instance, pi ranged from 0.00000 to 0.00149 for r165 and CO-I, respectively, in the southeastern populations, whereas the central population showed levels that ranged from 0.00250 to 0.00232 for the same gene regions. Both gene regions indicate significant levels of structuring among the southeastern populations (F-ST, 0.714 and 0.612, P < 0.0001, for r16S and CO-I), and these results are supported by the lack of actual gene flow. However, in order to confirm this hypothesis a larger number of populations along the range of distribution of the species should be tested. The phylogenetic reconstruction by maximum parsimony (MP), minimum evolution (ME), and maximum likelihood (ML) of these populations and other astacids and atyids, confirms the monophyly of the two southeastern populations (P llamasi) as well as of C. montezumae, and suggests that Cambaridae constitutes a non-monophyletic assemblage, a hypothesis herein confirmed by a total evidence Bayesian analysis.",
1305,"Sustainability of groundwater management in the coastal plain of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) The city of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) is one of the fastest-growing cities in sub-Saharan Africa. The city faces periodic water shortages, during which water demand is hardly satisfied. Only one third of the households receives water directly from the public water supply and water needs relies increasingly on groundwater. The sectors that represent the key/central aspects of vulnerability for Dar es Salaam, are water supply, waste management, drainage, and health services. The Adapting to Climate Change in Coastal Dar es Salaam (ACC-DAR) project is a co-founded research project, granted by the European Union, leaded by the Sapienza, University of Rome, in cooperation with Ardhi University of Dar es Salaam. The project will enhance the adaption to Climate Change (CC) capacities of Dar's municipalities, by increasing their understanding of adaptation practices, and by developing methodologies for integrating adaptation activities into strategies and plans for Urban Development and Environment Management (UDEM) in unplanned and unserviced coastal settlements. This paper deals with the results obtained by the approach carried out in the aim of better manage groundwater in the coastal aquifer of Dar es Salaam.",
1306,"Arsenic in cereals, their relation with human health risk, and possible mitigation strategies Arsenic (As) contamination of edible plants is now well recognized mainly in Bangladesh, India, and some other countries of South and Southeast Asia and Latin America. It is well known that long-term use of As-contaminated irrigation water adds As to soils and edible plants to adversely affect food production and quality. Consolidated evidence shows that As uptake in edible plants and crops is proportionally associated with the presence of high As in soils and irrigation waters. However, factors such as cultivation method, As speciation, soil composition, origin, and type of plant have major impact on the amount of As uptake. When As is absorbed by crops and edible plants, this may add substantially to the dietary As intake, thus posing human health risks to local inhabitants and to places where the As-contaminated food is exported. To date, limited attention has been paid to the risk of consumption of As-contaminated foods. In this context, our aim was to review As uptake in some of the common and popular cereals that have been a cause of human health risk. We also reviewed possible mitigation options and what needs to be done in the future.",
1307,"Sedimentological characteristics of continental sabkha, south Western Desert, Egypt Continental sabkha is recorded in the extreme middle part of the south Western Desert of Egypt representing one of the most promising areas for sustainable development, especially for agriculture. The geomorphologic units of the area are formed under the influence of structural, lithological, and/or climatic controls. These units include pediplain, depressions, mass-wasted blocks, residual hills, drainage lines, and aeolian landforms. The effective deflation process is reinforced by the lack of protective vegetation cover and the susceptibility of weakly consolidated rocks to wind removal. Different rock units covering the area range in age from Early Cretaceous to Quaternary. Quaternary deposits include playa/sabkha deposits where the continental sabkha is divided into four zones A, B, C, and D. Underground waters coming from the north and east were progressively enriched in solute by interaction with the surrounding sedimentary and igneous rocks. Most of the evaporite minerals grow displacively as a result of evaporative pumping. Mineralogically, the continental sabkha salt complex includes gypsum, natroalunite, tamarugite, bloedite, eugsterite, nitratine, halite, and D'ansite. Some of the major and trace elements (SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, as well as Rb, Ba, Zr, Sr, Y, V, and Zn) were measured. The correlation and enrichment of these major and trace elements indicate the origin of the salt complex in the sabkha.",
1308,"Arsenic metabolism efficiency has a causal role in arsenic toxicity: Mendelian randomization and gene-environment interaction BACKGROUND: Arsenic exposure through drinking water is a serious global health issue. Observational studies suggest that individuals who metabolize arsenic efficiently are at lower risk for toxicities such as arsenical skin lesions. Using two single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) in the 10q24.32 region (near AS3MT) that show independent associations with metabolism efficiency, Mendelian randomization can be used to assess whether the association between metabolism efficiency and skin lesions is likely to be causal. METHODS: Using data on 2060 arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi individuals, we estimated associations for two 10q24.32 SNPs with relative concentrations of three urinary arsenic species (representing metabolism efficiency): inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid(MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). SNP-based predictions of iAs%, MMA% and DMA% were tested for association with skin lesion status among 2483 cases and 2857 controls. RESULTS: Causal odds ratios for skin lesions were 0.90 (95% confidence interval[CI]: 0.87, 0.95), 1.19 (CI: 1.10, 1.28) and 1.23 (CI: 1.12, 1.36)for a one standard deviation increase in DMA%, MMA% and iAs%,respectively. We demonstrated genotype-arsenic interaction, with metabolism-related variants showing stronger associations with skin lesion risk among individuals with high arsenic exposure (synergy index: 1.37; CI: 1.11, 1.62). CONCLUSIONS: We provide strong evidence for a causal relationship between arsenic metabolism efficiency and skin lesion risk. Mendelian randomization can be used to assess the causal role of arsenic exposure and metabolism in a wide array of health conditions.exposure and metabolism in a wide array of health conditions.Developing interventions that increase arsenic metabolism efficiency are likely to reduce the impact of arsenic exposure on health.",1
1309,"Characterizing the reactivity of metallic iron in Fe-0/U-VI/H2O systems by long-term column experiments Aqueous iron corrosion has been identified as a powerful process for environmental remediation and safe drinking water provision. The intrinsic reactivity of conventional micro-scale metallic iron (Fe-0) has been mostly enhanced by the association of other metals (e.g. Cu, Ni and Pd) or by using nano-scale Fe-0. However, the mechanisms responsible for increased reactivity are yet to be univocally elucidated. Therefore, it appears that basic knowledge on Fe-0 intrinsic reactivity decreases as Fe-0 technology advances. This work was performed to address the intrinsic reactivity of four selected conventional Fe-0 materials in long-term column studies. Five systems were investigated. Each system was made up of two columns in series. The first column contains 5.0 g of a U-bearing rock mixed with sand. The second sand column contained 0.0 or 4.0 g of each Fe-0. The extent of U fixation in the systems was used to characterize the reactivity of the Fe-0 materials. Results showed a clearer differentiation among the three Fe-0 materials which exhibited very closed extents of iron dissolution in 2 mM EDTA under dynamic conditions. The crucial importance of long-term column experiments to test the suitability of Fe-0 for field applications is delineated. A new research trend is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

1310,"Impact of Demographic Growth on Seawater Intrusion: Case of the Tripoli Aquifer, Lebanon Water resources in Mediterranean coastal aquifers are subject to overexploitation leading to an increase in seawater intrusion. Based on the United Nations Environment Program, ""UNEP"" 75% of people in the world will live in coastal cities by 2020. This is having a major impact on the salinization process. This paper deals with the impact of demographic evolution on seawater intrusion and considers the case of the lower Tripoli aquifer in Lebanon. A numerical model based on the sharp interface approach is implemented using ""Freefem++"" to access the seawater intrusion. The model is verified against an analytic and a numerical solution. It is calibrated and validated against hydraulic head observations (RMSD = 0.819 m). Then several scenarios of pumping are applied based on available demographic growth rates to quantify the impact on seawater intrusion. The projection scenarios show that if the current pumping rates are maintained while maintaining the demographic evolution, the pumping wells will be salinized within 2 decades in the highly populated areas.",
1311,"Late Miocene advent of tall grassland paleosols in Oregon Paleosols in the late Miocene Rattlesnake Formation reveal three successive paleoclimatic regimens that can be dated using cumulative paleosol development prior to the radiometrically dated Rattlesnake Ash-Flow Tuff (7.05 Ma). The basal Rattlesnake Formation (ca. 7.5-7.3 Ma) has a suite of weakly calcareous paleosols indicating subhumid paleoclimate (800-1000 mm mean annual precipitation or MAP) and seasonal waterlogging. A shift at ca. 7.3 Ma to semi-arid paleoclimate (MAP 500-850) is indicated by paleosols with calcic horizons at depths of 105-85 cm. A second shift at ca. 7,2 Ma ushered in an assemblage of soils with shallow (36-53 cm) calcic horizons, indicating semi-arid conditions (MAP 200-600 mm) not much different from today. Along with the climatic shifts documented by the paleosols there also are substantial changes in alluvial architecture and paleotopography. The lower Rattlesnake Formation (ca. 7.5-7.2 Ma) was deposited by a stream flowing northeast in an ancestral John Day Valley. The upper part of the formation (ca. 7.2-7.1 Ma) was deposited within large alluvial fans shed from the growing anticline of Picture Gorge Basalt to the north. Stepwise changes in former vegetation can also be interpreted from paleosols, The basal Rattlesnake Formation (7,5-7.3 Ma) has a suite of paleosols with root traces, clay skins and manganese nodules like those of riparian woodland and seasonally waterlogged riparian meadow. The succeeding paleoclimatic sequence (7.3-7.2 Ma) includes the earliest known mollic paleosols with deep ( > 50 cm) calcareous nodules, interpreted as former soils of tall grassland. Also found are manganese-stained paleosols of seasonally waterlogged meadows, and weakly developed paleosols of early successional riparian vegetation, A later paleoclimatic sequence (7.2-7.1 Ma) includes desert shrubland paleosols, as well as paleosols of early successional riparian vegetation. Fossil bones and teeth found in many paleosols indicate coeval changes in mammalian faunas. The major shift from woodland to grassland at ca. 7.3 Ma introduced into this area tall grassland ecosystems, including large cursorial horses and pronghorns. Aridification continued with the shift to shrubland ca. 7.2 Ma (early Hemphillian), which corresponds to continent-wide mass extinction of most remaining browsing mammals from the Clarendonian Chronofauna.

1312,"Geochemistry of trace elements in the ground water of Cuttack City, India The concentration of some trace metals, like Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Co, Cr and Ni, was measured in the potable water of Cuttack City, India during winter, summer and rain events in the course of a two year period. Apart from Fe, all other trace metals fell well within the maximum permissible limit set by WHO for drinking water. On the basis of spatial/temporal variations, weathering of rocks and anthropogenic input were found to be main sources of trace elements in the ground water. The considerable temporal changes indicate that a majority of trace metals is entering the aquifer during rain fall. Factor analysis of the trace element data suggest that Fe, Mn and Cr are interrelated with each other and derived significantly from the aquifer, whereas input of Pb and Co may be due to atmospheric deposition in the study area.",1
1313,"The effect of a change in irrigation water quality on the salt load of the deep percolate of a saline sodic soil - a computer simulation study Recent studies conducted in the BreÃ« River Valley in South Africa, have indicated that the return flow from the flood irrigated soils (using saline borehole water) add substantially to the salt load of the receiving river. In the present study an irrigation return flow model, developed at the USBR, was used to predict what the effect of a change in irrigation water quality would have on the chemical composition of the deep percolate of a saline-sodic soil. Three scenarios were investigated, i.e. irrigation with saline borehole water (TDS = 1,279 mg/1), irrigation with low electrolyte water (TDS=91 mg/1), and irrigation with the low electrolyte water in the presence of surface applications of gypsum. The results indicate that the present flood irrigation practices lead to deep percolation losses of ca. 155 mm/ha/a. In the case of the borehole water the TDS content of the deep percolate ranges between 5,500 and 6,400 mg/l, equivalent to salt loads of 8.59 and 9.98 t/ha/a respectively. By replacing the saline borehole water with the low electrolyte water the TDS content of the deep percolate will, over a five year period, be reduced to 2,100 mg/1, and the salt load to 3.3 t/ha/a. Surface applications of gypsum to prevent clay dispersion and hydraulic conductivity failures will, when compared to the low electrolyte scenario, increase the salt load by 1.2 t/ha/a. However, it will still be 4.84 t/ha/a less than is presently the case. It is concluded that by using the better quality irrigation water in combination with gypsum applications, the salt load in the receiving river attributable to irrigation return flow, can be reduced by approximately 10%.

1314,"Cumulative Impacts of Land Cover Change and Dams on the Land-Water Interface of the Tocantins River Riparian vegetation performs important ecosystems services, improving water quality, mitigating erosion, and maintaining regional plant and animal biodiversity. Regular annual flooding maintains riparian forests through an intermediate disturbance regime. In response, seasonally flooded vegetation has developed adaptations for seed dispersal and gas transfer to survive and reproduce while undergoing periods of flooding. In the Amazon, a dam building boom threatens the integrity of riparian vegetation by moving riparian corridors into dry-adapted ecosystems and reducing downstream flooding of riparian areas. Additionally, the region is undergoing intense development pressure resulting in the conversion of native riparian vegetation into agriculture. In this study, we measure how the installation of six large dams on the Tocantins River, coupled with land cover change from native forest and savanna to cattle pasture, has changed the land-water interface of this region. Using land cover data provided by MapBiomas, we quantified land cover change from 1985 to 2018 and measured changes in the riparian areas of the still free-flowing areas of the Tocantins River, riparian areas surrounding reservoirs, and in-stream vegetation dynamics. We found that deforestation in the riparian areas of the Tocantins River downstream of the dams is occurring at a higher rate than deforestation in the watershed. Additionally, reservoir filling resulted in creating hundreds of square kilometers of new riparian areas, pushing the riparian zone away from forest-dominated ecosystems into savanna-dominated areas. The quantity of in-stream vegetation throughout the study was dynamic and initially increased after damming before declining for the last decade of the study. Changes to native land cover in riparian areas of the Tocantins River threaten the integrity of ecosystem services provided by riparian vegetation and are likely to lead to further degradation of these areas.",
1315,"Beyond hydrology in the sustainability assessment of dams: A planners perspective - The Sarawak experience There is increasing concern about the availability of water supplies in developing countries to provide clean drinking water and sanitation as well as providing for irrigation for food security. This has led to hydrologically led investigation to establish the feasibility and storage capacity of potentially new dam sites. This task has become more difficult for hydrologists and others with the uncertainties created by climate change and the measurement of the hydrological, geographical and ecological footprint of new dams. The questions asked by hydrologists are increasingly likely to be required to be cast in terms of the four pillars of sustainability; environmental, economic, social and institutional. Similarly, regional planners have to be more cognisant of the social outcomes of dam development while understanding the wider hydrological context at a watershed and basin level. The paper defines the concept of sustainability assessment in the context of resettlement and analyses its implications for the Bakun Hydro-electric project in Sarawak, Malaysia. Specifically it attempts to address the question of what social sustainability would really mean in the context of communities affected by dam projects, and their catchments using hermeneutics, tradeoffs and offsets. The findings of this question were presented at a hydrological conference held in Santiago in October 2010, based on the outcome of specific questionnaire responses received from indigenous peoples affected by the Bakun Dam hydroelectric project.

For this purpose, 16 water samples were collected and analyzed for the determination of selected trace elements, major ions and stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2). The chemical and isotopic features of the investigated groundwater samples suggest that they are significantly affected by fluids originated from Taftan volcano driven toward the surface by local and regional fault systems. The volcanic source is also responsible for the relatively high concentrations of As, U and V, which pose severe concerns for the quality of the water resource in the area. Distribution of As seems to be independent of pH values and the concentrations of Fe, the latter commonly forming As-adsorbing minerals, likely due to the precipitation of siderite and the occurrence of As colloids. Lack of correlation between As and SO4 seems to exclude a significant As contribution from sulfide minerals.",1
1317,"Design of Integrated Water Systems: Water Distribution System, Household Water-Saving Scheme, and Sanitary Sewer Perspectives An integrated design method that complements the increasing uptake of water-saving schemes (WSSs) is presented. WSSs may consist of water-saving fittings, appliances, rainwater-harvesting systems (RWHSs), and water-reuse schemes that provide the link between water distribution systems (WDSs) and sanitary sewers (SSs). The method developed here considers the interaction between WDSs, WSSs, and SSs to provide unified solutions. In this paper, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated and solved considering three objectives, which are (1) minimization of the total cost incurred by implementing water system interventions, i.e., excluding the associated cost savings; (2) maximization of cost savings, which are benefits conferred by interventions; and (3) minimization of system water demand. The decision variables include conventional water network design interventions (i.e., addition of pipes) and the water-saving equipment at a household level. The main constraints include both WDS and SS hydraulic performances. The optimal trade-off solutions are obtained using nondominated sorting genetic algorithm optimization processes. This method was demonstrated in the realistic subsystem of the Tsholofelo Extension water and SS networks in Gaborone, Botswana. The results show that integrating and optimizing WDS, WSS, and SS designs would improve water security and lead to more sustainable water systems. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",
1318,"Hydrochemical studies and evaluation of groundwater quality of the Quaternary aquifer at Faquss, Al Sharqiya Governorate, Egypt The Quaternary deposits represent the main groundwater aquifer in the study area. During the last few years, the problem of groundwater contamination has been intensified mainly due to natural and human-related factors. The present work aims to study the hydrochemical characteristics and quality assessment of shallow groundwater of the Quaternary aquifer at Faquss district. To achieve that, 16 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for major ions, trace elements, and microbiological analysis. Constructions of water level map of the Pleistocene aquifer and distribution maps for different ions in groundwater were made by surfer software. Statistical analyses for water quality parameters were carried out. Results indicate that most of the studied area is characterized by fresh water (TDS < 1000 mg/L) with low contents of K, Na, Mg, Ca, SO4, and Cl reflecting the suitability of ground water for drinking. High contents of TDS, Na, SO4, and Cl are recorded at the northeastern parts of the area; this refers to the existence of local pollution sources resulting from the infiltration of domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastes in the intensive populated area. The concentrations of trace elements (chromium, copper, cadmium, etc.) in groundwater are within the acceptable limits for drinking and domestic uses. Iron and manganese are over the acceptable limits in most of the area and the groundwater is unsuitable for drinking. Low contents of iron and manganese are recorded at the north, while aluminum contents are over the acceptable limits at the same site. The results of bacteriological analyses indicate the existence of E. coli bacteria in most of shallow wells ranges between 4 and 800 ml. So, shallow groundwater should be chemically treated before drinking. Generally, the groundwater in the studied area is suitable for irrigation, except 19% of wells suffer from sodium hazards. The ratio rNa/rCl varies between 1.012 and 1.56 in most groundwater samples and indicates the continental origin of groundwater in the study area. The ratio r (K + Na)-rCl/rSO(4) reflects either Na-2-SO4 water type (in 75% of groundwater samples) or NaHCO3 water type of shallow meteoric origin (in 25% of groundwater samples). The presence of Na2SO4 water type in deep meteoric water genesis at shallow depth is associated with sulfate salts (MgSO4, and CaSO4) which formed more than 25% of salt combination might reflect the influence of anthropogenic activities. The dominant process determining the water composition is evaporation.",1
1319,"Soil respiration response to alterations in precipitation and nitrogen addition in a desert steppe in northern China Global climate change is expected to significantly influence soil respiration. When limited, rainfall and nitrogen (N) deposition strongly modify soil respiration in a broad range of biomes, but uncertainty remains with regards to the influence of the interactions of seasonal rainfall distribution and N deposition on soil respiration in an arid steppe. In the present study, we manipulated precipitation using V-shaped plexiglass gutters (minus 50%, control, and plus 50% treatments) and tested various N additions (control and plus 35â€¯kgâ€¯Nâ€¯ha(-1)â€¯yr(-1)) to evaluate their impact on soil respiration, measured using a Li-Cor 8100, in a desert steppe in China. Increased precipitation stimulated soil respiration by 26.1%, while decreased precipitation significantly reduced soil respiration by 10.8%. There was a significant increase in soil respiration under N addition at 11.5%. Statistical assessment of their interactions demonstrated that N supplementation strengthened the stimulation of soil respiration under increased precipitation, whereas decreased precipitation offset the positive impact of N addition and led to a reduction in soil respiration. Contrasting interannual precipitation patterns strongly influenced the temporal changes in soil respiration as well as its response to N addition, indicating that the desert steppe plant community was co-limited by water and N. Net primary productivity (aboveground and belowground) predominantly drove soil respiration under altered precipitation and N addition. As grasses are better equipped for water deficit due to their previous exposure to long periods without water, there could be a shift from forb to grass communities under drier conditions. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the differential impacts of plant traits and soil physiochemical properties on soil respiration under altered precipitation and N addition.",
1320,"Analysis of rainfall runoff characteristics from a subtropical urban lawn catchment in South-east China Characteristics of rainfall runoff from a 3.26 hm(2) urban catchment with predominant land-use as lawn in Xiamen City, South-east China were investigated and analyzed. Water quality and quantity measurements of rainfall runoff were conducted for ten rainfall events over the period March, 2008 to April, 2009. The results indicated that chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) were the major pollutants with event mean concentrations of 56.09 and 0.44 mg center dot L-1. From hydrograph and pollutograph analysis of two typical rainfall events, it was clear that the peak rainfall preceded the peak flowrate by about 15-20 min. Meanwhile, concentrations of major pollutants showed multiple peaks and these peaks usually preceded peak flowrate. There were no distinctive first-flush effects except for the rainfall events with the longest rainfall duration and largest runoff volume, which was verified by the fact that the first 30% runoff volume (FF30) carried 39.36% of the total suspended solids (TSS) load, 35.17% of the COD load, 28.13% of the TP load and 39.03% of the nitrate nitrogen load. Multivariate regression analysis further demonstrated that the total runoff volume had a positive correlation with the FF30 of TSS and COD.",
1321,"Soil mapping for land-use planning in a karst area of N Thailand with due consideration of local knowledge For the development of sustainable land-management systems in the highlands of N Thailand, detailed knowledge about soil distribution and soil properties is a prerequisite. Yet to date, there are hardly any detailed soil maps available on a watershed scale. In this study, soil maps on watershed level were evaluated with regard to their suitability for agricultural land-use planning. In addition to common scientific methods (as underlying the WRB classification), participatory methods were used to exploit local knowledge about soils and to document it in a ""Local Soil Map"". Where the WRB classification identified eight soil units, the farmers distinguished only five on the basis of soil color and ""hardness"". The ""Local Soil Map"" shows little resemblance with the detailed, patchy pattern of the WRB-based soil map. On the contrary, the ""Local Soil Map"" is fairly similar to the petrographic map suggesting that soil color is directly related to parent material. The farmers' perception about soil fertility and soil suitability for cropping could be confirmed by analytical data. We conclude that integrating local soil knowledge, petrographic information, and knowledge of local cropping practices allows for a rapid compilation of information for land-evaluation purposes at watershed level. It is the most efficient way to build a base for regional land-use planning.",
1322,"Water Quality Threats, Perceptions of Climate Change and Behavioral Responses among Farmers in the Ethiopian Rift Valley This work aims to assess water quality for irrigated agriculture, alongside perceptions and adaptations of farmers to climate change in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). Climate change is expected to cause a rise in temperature and variability in rainfall in the region, reducing surface water availability and raising dependence on groundwater. The study data come from surveys with 147 farmers living in the Ziway-Shala basin and water quality assessments of 162 samples from groundwater wells and surface water. Most groundwater samples were found to be unsuitable for long term agricultural use due to their high salinity and sodium adsorption ratio, which has implications for soil permeability, as well as elevated bicarbonate, boron and residual sodium carbonate concentrations. The survey data indicate that water sufficiency is a major concern for farmers that leads to frequent crop failures, especially due to erratic and insufficient rainfall. An important adaptation mechanism for farmers is the use of improved crop varieties, but major barriers to adaptation include a lack of access to irrigation water, credit or savings, appropriate seeds, and knowledge or information on weather and climate conditions. Local (development) agents are identified as vital to enhancing farmers' knowledge of risks and solutions, and extension programs must therefore continue to promote resilience and adaptation in the area. Unfortunately, much of the MER groundwater that could be used to cope with declining viability of rainfed agriculture and surface water availability, is poor in quality. The use of saline groundwater could jeopardize the agricultural sector, and most notably commercial horticulture and floriculture activities. This study highlights the complex nexus of water quality and sufficiency challenges facing the agriculture sector in the region, and should help decision-makers to design feasible strategies for enhancing adaptation and food security.",
1323,"Impact of land use on shallow groundwater quality characteristics associated with human health risks in a typical agricultural area in Central China Groundwater pollution seriously threatens water resource safety due to high-intensity land use throughout the world. However, the relationship between groundwater pollution characteristics and land use in alluvial plains is still unclear. In this study, the effects of land use on shallow groundwater quality and human health risk were investigated via two sampling campaigns in a typical alluvial plain, namely, Jianghan Plain, China. Results show that the shallow groundwater in this area was polluted by nitrogen (with average concentrations of 5.12 mg/L in the dry season and 4.46 mg/L in the rainy season) and phosphorus (0.29 and 0.13 mg/L in the two seasons, respectively). The nutrient concentrations during the dry season were significantly higher than those during the rainy season (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that the concentration of nutrients was significantly positively correlated with cultivated land and negatively correlated with water and residence, suggesting that land use patterns can affect the groundwater quality. The best buffer where land use patterns affect the total N concentration was about 1000 m for cultivated land and water, while the optimal ranges for ammonium N were about 1000 and 2500 m for the areas, respectively. For the total phosphorus, a radius of 2000 m leads to the best fitting effect on both areas. Human health risk assessment showed that the total health risk indexes in about 75% of the samples were higher than 1, indicating the potential risk of the shallow groundwater in this area to human health. The results indicate that land use patterns will greatly affect the shallow groundwater quality. Thus, adjusting the land use pattern can improve the water quality and reduce health risks. Identification and selection of appropriate management solutions for the groundwater protection should be based on not only water quality problems but also surface land use patterns.",
1324,"Primary health care, community participation and community-financing: experiences of two middle hill villages in Nepal Although community involvement in health related activities is generally acknowledged by international and national health planners to be the key to the successful organization of primary health care, comparatively little is known about its potential and limitations. Drawing on the experiences of two middle hill villages in Nepal, this paper reports on research undertaken to compare and contrast the scope and extent of community participation in the delivery of primary health care in a community run and financed health post and a state run and financed health post. Unlike many other health posts in Nepal these facilities do provide effective curative services, and neither of them suffer from chronic shortage of drugs. However, community-financing did not appear to widen the scope and the extent of participation. Villagers in both communities relied on the health post for the treatment of less than one-third of symptoms, and despite the planners' intentions, community involvement outside participation in benefits was found to be very limited. During the summer of 1992, data were gathered through household and personal interviews in two isolated villages in western Nepal to compare a state- and a community-sponsored health center. The Ghandruk Community Health Centre was established in 1987 by a local nongovernmental organization (NGOs) and the Sikles health post was established by the Indian government in the mid-1950s. A comparison of the health-seeking behavior in each village showed that both health centers accounted for only about 30% of treatment, that 40% of illnesses were self-treated, and that 26% of illness in Ghandruk and 35% in the poorer Sikles remained untreated. In each village, more than 90% of the sample was unaware of the existence of a health committee and the health committees were afforded very low status compared to other committees (such as the forest committee). Health committee members were more active in Sikles despite the fact that the health post was controlled by district/regional health authorities. Health workers were more readily identified than members of the health committees but they performed only a few of their educational and health promotional tasks. Village health workers appeared to be inactive, and none of the trained traditional birth attendants were practicing. While the two villages showed no differences in participation in the delivery and use of health services, villagers in Ghandruk have been active in health-related activities such as the construction of private latrines, the development of a water supply, and regular clean-up campaigns. In Sikles, where such interventions have yet to be accomplished, the morbidity rate in the sample population was 81%, compared with 23.9% for Ghandruk. These results lead to the following observations: 1) the applicability of a participatory approach to development in rural Nepal is questionable from a cross-cultural perspective, and 2) the existence of socioeconomic and cultural hierarchies in the villages combined with male domination of the health committees prevents health committees from representing the needs of the entire community. In conclusion, community financing did not appear to increase community participation in the delivery and use of health services or to result in greater equity in health care. Rather than leading to abandonment of this financing option, however, these results should help lead to the creation of a proper balance between the role of government, NGOs, and community self-help in the delivery of health care. eng",
1325,"The Dutch academic boycott against South Africa: An analysis The year 1960 was a watershed in South Africa's history. The shootings at Sharpeville, 21 March 1960, had a negative impact on South Africa's foreign relations. South Africa and the Netherlands became estranged. The boycott and sanctions movement would set in. In 1962 the UN General Assembly set up the Special Committee against Apartheid. In 1968 the General Assembly asked all member states to suspend cultural, educational and sporting exchanges with South Africa. In 1980 the General Assembly adopted a resolution asking all member states to take steps to prevent all cultural, academic, sports and other exchanges with South Africa. A similar resolution was adopted in 1983. The European Community adopted a series of measures in 1985, inter alia to discourage cultural, sporting and scientific contacts with South Africa. The Soweto uprising in 1976 and the death of Steve Biko in 1977 led to an outcry in the Netherlands. The Dutch government thus froze the Cultural Accord with South Africa in 1977 and it was finally abandoned in 1981. The Anti-Apartheidsbeweging Nederland (AABN) (Anti-aparthed movement of the Netherlands) published in 1980 a Zwartboek over wetenschappelijke kontakten tussen Nederland en Zuid-Afrika (Black book concerning scientific contacts between the Netherlands and South Africa). The AABN strongly condemned scientific and academic contacts between the Netherlands and South Africa. They were also very supportive of the African National Congress (ANC). Dr Zola Skweyiya of the scientific bureau of the ANC visited the Netherlands in 1980. He was received with open arms at Dutch universities. The Dutch universities were a formidable ally in the anti-apartheid struggle. The Rev. C.F. Beyers Naude received an honorary doctorate in 1972 from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU). The VU severed its ties with Potchefstroom University in 1974 and 1976. White South African academics were no longer allowed to lecture at the VU. The ANC stalwart, Govan Mbeki, received an honorary doctorate in 1978 from the Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA). The ceremony was a demonstration of solidarity with the ANC and its leaders. The Govan Mbeki Fund was launched in 1977 to support South African students financially who could not complete their studies because of apartheid. The ANC was very much involved with the fund. The President of the ANC, Oliver Tambo, was invited to give a speech at the opening of the academic year in 1983. The Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht (RUU) severed its ties with South African academic institutions in 1979. A bust of Paul Kruger was stolen from the Senate Chamber in 1979. Kruger was seen as a symbol of the apartheid policy. Winnie Mandela received an honorary doctorate from the RUU in 1986. This gesture was widely criticized. An anti-apartheid fund was also launched in 1986. The Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG) severed its ties with South African academic institutions in 1978. A follow up motion to that effect was accepted in 1985. The only contact that was acceptable was contact that was supportive of the anti-apartheid struggle. A Winnie Mandela Fund was launched in 1986 to support students that had to flee South Africa because of apartheid. The Rijksuniversiteit Leiden (RUL) severed its ties with South African academic institutions in 1978. The Dutch universities with the aid of the anti-apartheid organisations did their utmost to isolate and boycott white South Africa. In this process they were very supportive of the ANC. The Dutch academic boycott had a negative effect in many ways. Many white South African students could no longer study at Dutch universities. Dutch as an academic language in South Africa would also lose ground. The same applied to Afrikaans in the Netherlands. The younger Afrikaans-speaking academics would pursue other academic avenues in the broader European and American context.",
1326,"ACCESS TO QUALITY WATER AS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT: THE GUARANTEE OF THE EXISTENTIAL MINIMUM The aim is to analyze the evolution of the discussion about the recognition of access to quality water as a fundamental human right, as well as the guarantee of free access to the existential minimum. The scope a search is threefold, namely: 1. to assess the fundamentals of understanding access to quality water as a fundamental human right; 2. verify that this fundamental human right is recognized in the constitutions of some countries in Latin Americo, selected due to the housing volume and 3. investigate as elements external to the legal system, but with which they are closely related, present themselves as challenges to guarantee free access to the existential minimum. The methodological procedures adopted consist of bibliographic and jurisprudential research. Among the results achieved, it is observed that in Brazil the absence of express recognition in the constitution, leads the judiciary to deny free access to the existential minimum in case of user default.",
1327,"Assessment of climate change impact on hydrology of a transboundary river of Bhutan and India Assessing the impacts of climate change on a transboundary river plays an important role in sustaining water security within as well as beyond the national boundaries. At times, the unilateral decision taken by one country can increase the risk of negative effect on the riparian countries and if the impact is felt strongly by the other country, it can lead to international tension between them. This study examines the impact of climate change on hydrology between a shared river which is Wangchu river in Bhutan and Raidak river in India. The river is mainly used to produce hydropower in the two largest hydropower plants on which the majority of Bhutan's economic development depends and is mainly used for agriculture in India. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for future flow simulation. Future climate was projected for near future (NF) from 2025-2050 and far future (FF) from 2074-2099 using an ensemble of three regional climate models (ACCESS, CNRM-CM5 and MPI-ESM-LR) for two RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways), RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenario. The ensemble results indicated that, in future, the study area would become warmer with temperature increase of 1.5 degrees C under RCP 4.5 and 3.6 degrees C under RCP 8.5. However, as per RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, rainfall over the study area is projected to decrease by 1.90% and 1.38% respectively. As a consequence of the projected decrease in rainfall, the flow in river is projected to decrease by 5.77% under RCP 4.5 and 4.73% under RCP 8.5. Overall, the results indicated that the degree of hydrological change is expected to be higher, particularly for low flows in both Wangchu and Raidak River. Since transboundary water is a shared for economic growth, climate change adaptation and opportunities should also be considered by both the nations for better water management.",
1328,"MODELING THE EFFECT OF MATERIAL BEHAVIOR AND MILD THERMAL TREATMENTS ON COLLAPSE RESISTANCE OF UOE PIPES Oil exploration and production of offshore sources is continuously shifting towards increasing depths and more severe environmental conditions. Ultra deep waters are an objective in, e.g., the pre-salt layer off the Brazilian coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. Under these conditions, resistance to collapse of pipelines is a main concern. Increasing the collapse pressure p(c) is thus a primary objective, which would lead to a reduction of material and installation costs. To increase p(c), it is fundamental to understand which variables affect it, and how to control these variables. For instance, it is well known that ovality, residual stresses, and material constitutive behavior have a direct effect on p(c). Current efforts for improving p(c) of large diameter UOE pipes include an increase in flow stress by the application of a thermal cycle, similar to those typical of coating processes. These thermal treatments recover at least part of the early yielding due to the Bauschinger effect that develops during the collapse test, after the expansion stage. Predictive modeling of p(c), based on an appropriate set of input variables, allows for an adequate design of deep- and ultra-deep water projects. In the present work, an assessment by finite element analysis of the requirements on material characterization tests for a reliable prediction of p(c) has been performed. The most appropriate testing direction is the transverse compression. Moreover, since for large diameter pipes the plastic strain levels attained at collapse are often below 0.2%, the sample should allow for an accurate determination of compression behavior in this very low deformation range. This is particularly relevant for cold-formed pipes, as with the UOE process. Based on these guidelines, a testing sample geometry and compression data processing methodology has been designed. The methodology has been applied to a series of UOE processed pipes that had been thermally treated. On one hand, compression samples were extracted and used for the FE calculation of p(c). On the other hand, collapse tests were performed on the same pipes. Both the absolute values of p(c), and the enhancement of p(c) due to thermal cycling, were accurately predicted. In addition, both the flow stress after thermal cycling, and the measured p(c) values, clearly show that the fabrication factor alpha(fab) used in the standard DNV OS-F101 should be set to alpha(fab)>= 1 for an adequate rating of the pipes.",
1329,"Occurrence and ecological implications of organophosphate triesters and diester degradation products in wastewater, river water, and tap water The occurrence and composition profiles of 13 triester organophosphate flame retardants and their three diester metabolites in river water, wastewater, and tap water in China were studied. Most target organophosphate esters (OPEs) were found in water samples, with average concentrations of 787Â ng/L for triethyl phosphate (TEP) and 0.1Â ng/L for tripropyl phosphate (TPP) in wastewater, 1.48Â Ã—Â 10(3)Â ng/L for TEP and 0.12Â ng/L for tripentyl phosphate (TPeP) in river water, and 15.5Â ng/L for tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and 0.08Â ng/L for tritolyl phosphate (TMPP) in tap water. TEP was the most abundant compound among the detected OPEs in all water types. The exposure of zebrafish embryos showed negligible effects of TEP, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), while mixed solutions that mimic river water and wastewater composition disturbed the development of embryos and led to the altered transcription of genes relating to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. In addition, the binding affinity between OPEs and a thyroid hormone receptor (TRÎ²) protein was further investigated by molecular docking modeling, which helped to estimate the effects of OPEs on TRÎ². This research provides experimental and theoretical evidence for the ecotoxicological effects of OPEs in aquatic environments.",
1330,"Transformation of dissolved organic matter during full-scale treatment of integrated chemical wastewater: Molecular composition correlated with spectral indexes and acute toxicity As one of the key economic modes in China, chemical industry park (CIP) has made great contribution to the Chinese rapid economic growth. Concomitantly, how to effectively and safely dispose of the CIP wastewater (CIPWW) has been an unavoidable issue. Molecular transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in CIPWW treatment is essential to optimize the employed process and to provide solid basis for risk evaluation of the discharged effluent as well. In this study, electrospray ionization coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) was used to characterize the molecular transformation of DOM during full-scale treatment of integrated chemical wastewater in a centralized wastewater treatment plant (CWWTP), where the combined process follows hydrolysis/acidification (HA)-flocculation/precipitation (FP)-A(2)/O-membrane bioreactor (MBR)-ultrafiltration (UF)-reverse osmosis (RO). Compared to municipal wastewater, DOM in CIPWW exhibited higher unsaturation degree, lower molecular weight, and higher toxicity. In FP unit, DOM of C(<24) and higher nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) values was preferentially removed. The HA and anaerobic units are capable of significantly degrading DOM, resulting in great changes in molecular composition of DOM. However, the anoxic, oxic, and MBR units only lead to a slight change of the molecular formulae. The terminal units of UF and RO can remove most DOM, with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) declining by 19.2% and 94.6% respectively. The correlation between spectral indexes and acute toxicity with the molecular formulae of DOM suggested that polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols were positively correlated with the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)). In addition, both compounds (0.32â€¯<â€¯O/Câ€¯<â€¯0.63) as well as the aliphatic ones (0.22â€¯<â€¯O/Câ€¯<â€¯0.56) presented positive correlation with acute toxicity. Further, the pairwise correlation analysis illustrated that SUVA(254), O/C(wa), double bond equivalence (DBE(wa)), and NOSC(wa) were positively correlated with each other, whereas the acute toxicity was positively correlated with humification index (HIX), O/C(wa), and DBE(wa).",
1331,"Hydrochemical characteristics and a health risk assessment of the use of river water and groundwater as drinking sources in a rural area in Jiangjin District, China To determine the hydrochemical characteristics and health risks associated with their use as drinking water, 54 river water and 44 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed in a rural area of Jiangjin District, Chongqing City. The concentration of solutes in river water and groundwater showed significant spatial variability in the region. A number of dissolved chemical constituents including nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), boron (B), barium (Ba), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and selenium (Se) exceeded their respective recommended drinking water limits at some locations. Ternary plots of cations, anions and silica indicated that carbonate weathering was the primary source of major ions in water, followed by silicate weathering. Elevated concentrations of some chemical constituents including NO3- and chloride (Cl-) were found in water samples in areas with the most intensive agricultural land use activities. A health risk assessment indicated that Cl- and NO3- were the most important chemical constituents that were a non-carcinogenic health concern. A carcinogenic health risk assessment indicated that chromium (Cr) and As were the chemical constituents of most concern in water from the area that might be used as a drinking water source. The average annual carcinogenic risks for Cr in drinking water were determined to be in the range of 3.14E-05 and 7.90E-05 for adults and children, respectively. Similarly, the average annual carcinogenic risks for As in drinking water for adults and children were calculated to be in the range of 4.43E-07 and 1.11E-06, respectively. These values are within the risk values of 10(-6) to 10(-4), which generally indicate that there are health concerns that need to be addressed in more detail. The highest values of carcinogenic risk for drinking water were mainly located in the northern part of the study area where there are industrial activities that are potential sources of arsenic and chromium in surface water and groundwater.",1
1332,"Experimental protocol for evaluation of micro-emulsions that modify the mojability in porous media. Application to colombian fields Reserves of light crude oil arc decreasing in contrast to the discoveries of heavy crude which is why attention has been focused on this type of hydrocarbons. Colombia has a high potential in the heavy-crude development especially in the areas of the Llanos Orientales Basin (Campos: Rubiales, Castilla, Chichimene, Apiay, Suria) which have been produced in recent years to achieve that the 60% of the national production is associated with this type of resource. Heavy-oil production is not easy due to its high viscosity which causes low oil mobility and early water production in reservoirs with active aquifers. One of the main techniques used to increase productivity in heavy crude oil fields is the matrix stimulation of wells through the injection of treatments that positively alter the relative permeability curves (alteration of wettability) and thus improve the mobility of these crude oils. However, understanding the formation wettability is essential to optimize oil recovery. To assume that a formation is wettable by water, when in reality it is not, can cause irreversible damage to the reservoir. Therefore, the current study focused on developing and implementing a protocol at the laboratory level, to evaluate water-based matrix stimulation treatments that have ability to reverse natural oil wettability (generally to the oil, due to high affinity between oil and rock minerals of reservoir) towards water wettability, which leads to an improvement of relative permeability to crude oil. The experimental protocol was implemented at laboratory level for the Castilla Oilfield (Llanos Orientales basin in Colombia) and focused on three major stages. 1. Stage 1: Basic characterization of treatment fluids. 2. Stage 2: Fluid-fluid evaluation and theological behavior of formation fluids Vs. Chemical treatments. 3. Stage 3: Evaluation of effect on wettability (modification of contact angles and relative permeability). The main conclusions and recommendations obtained in this study are the following: 1. A suitable experimental protocol was developed for evaluation of microemulsions and / or mobility enhancing additives. 2. Implementation of protocol allowed selecting the best treatment of alteration of wettability for the Castilla oilfield. 3. The components of the oil, the brine chemistry, the mineral surface, the temperature, the pressure, the interfacial tension, the capillary pressure, the saturation history of reservoir, among other properties have an impact on the reservoir's wettability.",
1333,"The Impact of Geology of Recharge Areas on Groundwater Quality: A Case Study of Zhob River Basin, Pakistan Groundwater is a major source of water supply for domestic and irrigation uses in semiarid, remote but rapidly developing Kilasaifullah district part of Zhob River Basin, located at PakistanAfghanistan Border. Zhob River is among few major rivers of perennial nature in Balochistan, which flows from WSW to ENE and falls in Gomal River, a tributary of Indus River. Keeping in view the important geopolitical position and rapid development of the region, this study is primarily focused on groundwater chemistry for contamination sources as well as agriculture development. Water samples from open and tube wells are analyzed and calculated for electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, pH, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO?3-, Cl-, NO?3-, SO?42-, PO?43-, sodium percent (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), Kelly's index (KI), and heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Cr, Zn, Pb, and Mn). On the basis of the chemical constituents two zones within the study area are identified and possible causes of the contaminants are pointed out. Two recharge areas were responsible for the different chemical results in groundwater, e.g., zone A was recharged from NNW saline geological formations (Nisai, Khojak, Multana, Bostan formations, and Muslim Bagh ophiolites), which are concentrated with high sodium and chloride. On the other hand Zone B was sourced from SSW from carbonate rich rocks (Alozai, Loralai, Parh formations, and Muslim Bagh ophiolites). The groundwater is classified as C2S1, C3S1, C3S2, C4S2 on the basis of EC and SAR values which indicate that most of the water of both zones can be used for irrigation safely except the samples plotted in C3S2 and C4S2 categories which could be dangerous for soil and crops. Groundwater samples are plotted in good to permissible limits with some samples excellent to good and few samples belong to doubtful category based on sodium percent. Groundwater of zone A is unsuitable for irrigation use due to higher values of KI (more than one) but water of zone B are good for irrigation based on KI. In general, water of both zones is suitable for irrigation but care should be taken during the selection of crops which are sensitive to alkalinity or sodium hazards particularly in zone A.",1
1334,"Tectonics and topographic evolution of Namche Barwa and the easternmost Lhasa block, Tibet In the easternmost Himalaya and southeastern Tibet, the Namche Barwa-Gyala Peri massif and adjacent Lhasa block host some of the Earth's most active geologic processes and extreme topography. Synthesis of U-Th/He and Ar-Ar thermochronology, anatectic history, seismicity, and structural geology shows the important role that surface processes have played in this region in both local and orogen-scale crustal dynamics. Basement rocks of the massif underwent an episode of metamorphism, partial melting, and focused deformation that began ca. 10 Ma and likely remains active due to thermally mediated feedbacks between these processes and erosion. Strong differential rock uplift at Namche Barwa established the immense Namche Barwa knickzone on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which has been stabilized through coupling between erosion driven by high stream power and localized deformation. This knickzone has maintained a high secondary base level of similar to 3000 m for the upper Yarlung Tsangpo watershed and so has shielded a large region of southeastern Tibet from excavation by the river, which in turn could alter the morphology and so the dynamics of the eastern Himalayan orogenic wedge. The landscape evolution of the southeast Lhasa block involved slow regional unroofing or incision in the Neogene, a significant pulse of similar to 5 km of rapid exhumation from ca. 10 to 5 Ma, and since then a great reduction in exhumation started once the Namche Barwa knickzone on the Yarlung Tsangpo was established. The low-relief high-elevation surface in the area is a relatively young feature, developed after the rapid 10-5 Ma exhumation pulse.",
1335,"Reduction of Î²-ODAP and IP(6) contents in Lathyrus sativus L. seed by high hydrostatic pressure Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) seeds contain an endogenous neurotoxic non-proteinogenic amino acid, Î²-N-oxalyl-l-Î±,Î²-diaminopropionic acid (Î²-ODAP), a major limiting factor-for their human consumption. Furthermore, phytate (IP(6)), a well-known antinutrient is present in concentration capable of hindering bioavailability of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and other micronutrients from the seeds. Due to the reported capability of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) to reduce the content of certain antinutritional/toxic agents in seeds and grains, the impact of HHP on the reduction of Î²-ODAP and IP(6) were investigated. The contents of Î²-ODAP of accessions from different regions in Ethiopia were found to be in the range of 51.94 to 806.52â€¯mg/100â€¯g. Accession (GF(1)- Alemu, AK) exhibiting the highest Î²-ODAP content was selected for HHP treatment in soaked and batter forms using Central Composite Face Centered Design of experiments. The best HHP conditions in respect to Î²-ODAP reduction were also applied to the accession (GP-240038) with the lowest Î²-ODAP-content, a genetically improved variety (Wassie) and a variety from Germany (GR). The HHP treatment at 600â€¯MPa for 25â€¯min of seeds soaked for 6â€¯h and 12â€¯h exhibited the maximum reduction of Î²-ODAP (232.11â€¯mg/100â€¯g) and IP(6) (21.11â€¯mg/100â€¯g) respectively. The combined incremental effect of pressure and soaking time resulted in a more significant (pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯.001) reduction in both compounds than the interaction of pressure with holding time (pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯.05). A reduction of Î²-ODAP from 36.00 to 71.22% by soaked-HHP treatment was observed. Î²-ODAP reductions were always higher for soaked compared to batter grass pea seeds. IP(6) contents after HHP treatment ranged from 33.65â€¯mg/100â€¯g to nill. It can be concluded that pressure, soaking and holding time as well as the grass pea seed accession/variety had great impact on molecular structure changes, enhancement of enzyme activity and reduction in Î²-ODAP and IP(6) content.",
1336,"Experimental investigation of the petrophysical properties, minerals, elements and pore structures in tight sandstones Geological conditions on the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin are complex, and the amount of oil and gas exploration is low. In this paper, taking the S block in the eastern Ordos Basin as an example, we investigated the petrophysical properties, minerals, elements and pore structures of the middle Permian Shihezi Formation tight sandstones. The results show that the main lithologies of the target layer are lithic feldspar sandstone, lithic quartz sandstone, feldspar lithic sandstone and lithic sandstone. The pore types include residual intergranular pores, intergranular dissolution pores, intragranular dissolution pores, intercrystalline pores and microfractures. The porosity of the rock samples ranges between 1.4% and 19.5%, with an average of 9.95%; the permeability varies between 0.030 mD and 1.941 mD, with an average of 0.342 mD; and the water saturation is distributed between 1.0% and 69.5%, with an average of 30.7%. The water saturation of rock samples has negative correlations with porosity and permeability. Both displacement pressure (P-d) and median pressure (P-m) have good negative correlations with rock permeability. The median pore throat radius (r(m)) has a good positive correlation with rock permeability. Large pores with a throat radius greater than 0.1 mu m are most favorable for rock permeability. The Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) values of the rock samples range from 0.67 to 0.80, indicating that the silica in the rock was not affected by hydrothermal fluid during the formation process. The Si/(Si + Al + Fe) values of the rock samples range from 0.69 to 0.78, with an average of 0.73. Si has good positive correlations with Si/Al, Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) and Si/(Si + Al + Fe). The sedimentary environment of the Shihezi Formation sandstone was characterized by fresh water, a dry-hot climate and oxidizing conditions. The major elements correlate well with the pore structure parameters: as the debris particles or quartz grains increase, the petrophysical properties gradually improve. Finally, based on the petrophysical properties, minerals, elements and pore structure parameters, classification criteria for the pore structure of the Shihezi Formation tight sandstones in the study area are proposed.",
1337,"Alteration in yield, gas exchange and chlorophyll synthesis of ramie to progressive drought stress Water-deficit is an important factor limiting the fiber yield, globally. In order to evaluate the effects of water stress on ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.), a pot experiment was carried out in a rain-protected wire-house at Chongqing, China. Ramie plants were subjected to 4 varying watering regimes (well-watered, mild, moderate and severe drought stress) at flourishing stage for 10, 15 and 20 days. After imposition of the treatments, the alteration in growth, yield, gas exchange and chlorophyll contents were assessed. Results indicated that all stress treatments promoted a substantial decrease in net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (g s) and transpiration rate (E). However, intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) initially decreased under mild and moderate stress and increased in severe drought stress while intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) changed in opposite direction. The variation in gas exchange attributes indicated the decreased photosynthetic activity under mild and moderate stress pertaining to stomatal mechanisms while under severe drought due to non-stomatal mechanisms. In addition, decreased photosynthetic activity inhibited the growth of plants and led to severe decline in raw fiber yield. A continuous reduction in plant height, stem diameter, leaf area and plant biomass was observed as well as bast thickness and bast fresh weight. Nonetheless, progressive water stress led to a continuous loss of photosynthetic pigment concentrations. In summary, water stress decreased chlorophyll synthesis, gas exchange and growth and yield of ramie plants, but the extent of these variations was closely related with the intensity, severity and duration of the drought event and their interaction.",
1338,"Using multivariate statistical analysis in assessment of surface water quality and identification of heavy metal pollution sources in Sarough watershed, NW of Iran The Sarough watershed in NW Iran hosts a large amount of mineral occurrences and ore deposits which may be considered as the source of heavy metals in the region. The area has been studied previously; however, the methodology of this paper was less focused on previous studies. This study aimed to assess water quality, determine the spatial distribution pattern, and identify the sources of heavy metals in the main tributaries of Sarough watershed using pollution indexes, multivariate statistical methods, and processing data by geographic information system. Totally, 51 water samples were collected along the main rivers to determine the concentrations of heavy metals by ICP-MS. Regarding the drinking water, agriculture, and freshwater aquatic life guidelines, the rivers were assumed unsafe considering most of toxic elements' content, especially As. The mean values for heavy metal pollution indexes (HPI: 237.32) and metal indexes (MI: 25.37) indicated the intensive heavy metal pollution. The cluster analysis categorized the 51 sampling sites into four clusters with respect to pollution level. The results obtained from the Kruskal-Wallis and multiple comparison tests had the harmony with the results of CA in introducing the most impacted sampling sites and the parameters responsible for water quality degradation. The results of PCA showed the maximum similarity between As, Sb, Se, Fe, and Mn as well as base metals which was attributed to anthropogenic input from mining and mineral processing wastes. Association of Cr and Ni may suggest a lithology source (weathering of metamorphosed ultramafic outcrops). The maps prepared in the GIS system showed the spatial distribution pattern of toxic elements with maximum values nearby mining sites which decreases gradually toward downstream areas. Finally, the results showed that the Sarough River and its tributaries are influenced by high concentrations of heavy metals from the drainages of mining and ore processing sites and naturally occurring metal loadings as well as the geogenic sources such as weathering of geologic formations and hot springs.",1
1339,"Occurrence of naphthenate deposition in crude oil production field offshore Niger Delta Crude oil and produced water samples obtained from ten wells in an offshore field, Niger Delta, were analyzed, in order to determine the occurrence of naphthenates deposition in the field. Total acid number (TAN) and degrees API of the crude oil samples, pH and metal ions concentrations of the produced water samples were determined. The results revealed that TAN values ranged from 0.47 to 1.01 mgKOH/g with pH of 6.9-8.9, which were above established threshold. The metal ions concentrations especially for Ca++ and Na+ were relatively high. These imply a high possibility of metal-naphthenate precipitation in the oil production facilities in this field.",
1340,"Removal of arsenic by a granular Fe-Ce oxide adsorbent: Fabrication conditions and performance Iron-cerium hydroxide (Fe-Ce), which has shown a high arsenic (V) (As(V)) adsorption capacity in previous studies, was granulated using the vibration dropping method used to prepare small-sized fuel particles. Fabrication studies showed that the sintering process could not be used in the preparation of the granular Fe-Ce (GFC) adsorbent and that the optimum grain size was 1.0 mm for As(V) removal. The optimum sized GFC (GFC-1.0 mm) exhibited a Freundlich adsorption of 18.2 and 11.8 mg g(-1) at an equilibrium concentration of 1.0 and 0.1 mg L-1, respectively. The GFC-1.0 mm also showed equivalent As removal performance to READ, a commercial adsorbent with CeO2 as the sole metal oxide component (about 81%), under both space velocities of 240 and 24 h(-1) in column tests. The cost for the manufacturing of GFC, however, is much lower since iron is the major metal component (about 80%). Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) results showed that As was distributed from the surface to the center of the GFC after the As(V) adsorption experiment, suggesting that nearly all active sites inside the GFC were available for the removal of As(V). The As(V) on the used GFC could be desorbed with an efficiency of 89% using 1.0 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide, and the GFC after desorption showed similar As adsorption performance with the fresh GFC. In conclusion, the GFC consisting of 80% Fe and 20% Ce exhibited As removal performance equivalent to the commercial adsorbent consisting only of Ce. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1341,"Establishing Strategies for Sustainable Groundwater Management Plan for Typical Granitic Aquifers-A Pilot Study near Hyderabad, India For sustainable groundwater management plan (SGMP), a pilot study has been taken up in Palmakul-Kottur watershed (214 km(2)) near Hyderabad, India with integrated approach including remote sensing, hydrometeorological, hydrological, hydrogeological, geophysical and hydrochemical studies. The watershed is underlain by Archaean granites characterized by semi arid conditions with annual normal rainfall of 836 mm. Remarkable changes in land use pattern, have led to substantial impact on groundwater recharge to the aquifers. The productive phreatic aquifer up to 30 m depth is desaturated forcing to tap the groundwater from deeper aquifers of 100 m depths leading to deeper groundwater levels (> 20 meter below ground level) at places. Overall the stage of groundwater development varies from 78% to 103% and deterioration in groundwater quality is observed with respect to fluoride (max. 4.6 mg/L), nitrate (max. 300 mg/L) and electrical conductivity (max. 4200 micro s micro siemens/cm) at places. For suggesting zone-wise SGMP, the area has been divided into three zones, using geographical information system. Zone-1 (95 km(2)) is characterized by high weathering (> 10 m) & moderate to high yield (> 1 liters/second (lps). Zone-2 (35 km(2)) by low weathering (< 10 m & low yield (< 1 lps) and Zone-3 (84 km(2)) by poor groundwater quality (beyond drinking and irrigation permissible limits). The suggested plan includes site specific suitable artificial recharge structures, cultivation of irrigated dry crops and adaptation of micro irrigation techniques along with provision for alternate source of drinking water. Desilting of existing tanks and participatory groundwater management are recommended. The approach and the outcome of the pilot study will go a long way for up scaling in similar hydrogeological environs of the country. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",
1342,"Conversion of Biomass to Organic Acids by Liquefaction Reactions Under Subcritical Conditions Recently, liquefaction of biomass in subcritical water to convert it into value-added substances has been broadly attracting attention. However, there is a gap in literature about the levulinic acid, which is a high worth substance, production from biomass using subcritical water. As a green chemistry approach, decomposition of biomass could be obtained using subcritical water effectively. In this case, water uses as a solvent so that it gives a possibility to take place a reaction for the decomposition of biomass. Subcritical water, which liquid water and its temperature is higher than the normal boiling point of water, has higher ion product as well as higher concentrations of H+ and OH- ions. Additionally, it has high diffusivity, low viscosity and much lower dielectric constant. For instance, whereas dielectric constant of subcritical water is 80 at 298 K, it is 2 at 673 K. The point of this research paper is to assess the impacts of different reaction parameters on cellulose conversion as the principle segment of lignocellulosic biomasses for the production of value-added chemicals, particularly levulinic acid. Hazelnut shell waste was chosen as model biomass since hazelnut is a standout amongst the most cultivated agricultural crops in Turkey. Besides, Turkey provide 70% of the world's total hazelnut production. It was found that as reaction temperature increases, a considerable improvement on the amount of formed levulinic acid and conversion of hazelnut shell was observed. For instance, when the reaction temperature, time and acid concentration were 280 degrees C, 120 min and 50 mM, respectively, levulinic acid yield and conversion of hazelnut shell were found as 13.05 and 65.40%, respectively. Addition of H2SO4 enhanced the production of levulinic acid from waste hazelnut shell. Another method which is hybrid process could be used to produce value-added chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. Hybrid process basically combines hydrolysis and electrolysis in subcritical water. Subcritical water has much lower dielectric constant than liquid water at ambient temperature. So, it was claimed that if constant current was applied to the reaction medium through specially designed electrodes in subcritical water environment, electrolysis could alter the hydrolysis reaction of cellulose in a way of protonation of intra-and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding around anode and as a result electrolysis in subcritical water could decrease necessary thermal energy to hydrolyze the beta(1-4) glycosidic linkage. Therefore, we developed a green hybrid process by combining hydrolysis and electrolysis in subcritical water without using any toxic, organic solvents and catalyst. Effects of especially applied current and temperature on the product distribution and conversions of cellulose were revealed and hydrothermal electrolysis reaction pathway of cellulose was proposed. The significance of the interaction indicated that, applied voltage had major impact on cellulose hydrolysis. Maximum cellulose conversion (82%) was achieved at 230 degrees C and 180 min of reaction time in 25 mM of H2SO4. Application of 8.0 V of applied voltage to the reaction medium at reaction temperature of 230 degrees C increased the TOC conversion (50.3%) with acid concentration of 25 mM in comparison with current-free experiments. Thus, the idea of electrochemically generated acid layer due to the dissociation of water around anode is supported. As future perspective, the output of the study gave an idea about converting cellulose and various biomass wastes, which may have high cellulose, content and led the way in obtaining valuable chemicals from no utilized real biomass sources such as hazelnut shell waste. The studies with other biomasses are undergoing.",
1343,"Reduction and immobilization of Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions by blast furnace slag supported sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron In this study, an industrial waste-blast furnace slag (BFS) supported sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron (S-nZVI@BFS) was prepared and used for synergistic reduction and adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions. The characterization analysis showed that Fe-0 and FeS were well dispersed on the surface of BFS, and the specific surface area of S-nZVI@BFS was 141.986 m(2) g(-1). Batch experiments demonstrated that the removal capacity of Cr(VI) was as high as 184 mg/g for S-nZVI@BFS. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted the Cr(VI) removal kinetics well. Cr(VI) removal on the S-nZVI@BFS relied highly on pH values. The reduced Cr(VI) precipitated on S-nZVI@BFS mainly as CrxFe(1-x)(OH)(3), CrxFe(1-x) OOH and Cr2S3, and the alkaline capacity of the BFS could efficiently prevent the release of Cr(III) from the precipitations in acid condition. Thus, supporting S-nZVI on BFS was an effective and safe method for Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1344,"Widespread deficiencies of sulphur, boron and zinc in dryland soils of the Indian semi-arid tropics To characterize the fertility status of soils under dryland agriculture in the semi-arid regions of India, we collected 3622 soil samples from farmers' fields in watersheds, spread in several districts of Andhra Pradesh (AP; 5 districts), Karnataka (5 districts), Tamil Nadu (TN; 5 districts), Rajasthan (3 districts), Madhya Pradesh (MP; 2 districts), and Junagadh District, Gujarat. Results of the analysis of soil samples showed that almost all farmers' fields sampled were low in organic carbon and low-to-moderate in extractable phosphorus, but generally adequate in extractable potassium. The widespread deficiencies of sulphur (S) boron (B) and zinc (Zn) were most revealing; their deficiencies varied with nutrient, district and state. The deficiencies of S, B and Zn nutrients were more widespread in farmers' fields in AP, Karnataka, MP, TN and Gujarat than in the Rajasthan watersheds. Our results demonstrate that crops grown under rainfed agriculture in the semi-arid tropical regions of India not only face water shortages and deficiencies of major plant nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), but they also suffer from multi-nutrient deficiencies of S, B and Zn.",
1345,"An interlaboratory comparison of aerosol inorganic ion measurements by ion chromatography: implications for aerosol pH estimate Water-soluble inorganic ions such as ammonium, nitrate and sulfate are major components of fine aerosols in the atmosphere and are widely used in the estimation of aerosol acidity. However, different experimental practices and instrumentation may lead to uncertainties in ion concentrations. Here, an intercomparison experiment was conducted in 10 different laboratories (labs) to investigate the consistency of inorganic ion concentrations and resultant aerosol acidity estimates using the same set of aerosol filter samples. The results mostly exhibited good agreement for major ions Cl-, SO, NO, NH and K+. However, F-, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were observed with more variations across the different labs. The Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) data of nonrefractory SO, NO and NH generally correlated very well with the filter-analysis-based data in our study, but the absolute concentrations differ by up to 42 %. Cl- from the two methods are correlated, but the concentration differ by more than a factor of 3. The analyses of certified reference materials (CRMs) generally showed a good detection accuracy (DA) of all ions in all the labs, the majority of which ranged between 90 % and 110 %. The DA was also used to correct the ion concentrations to showcase the importance of using CRMs for calibration check and quality control. Better agreements were found for Cl-, SO, NO, NH and K+ across the labs after their concentrations were corrected with DA; the coefficient of variation (CV) of Cl-, SO, NO, NH and K+ decreased by 1.7%, 3.4%, 3.4%, 1.2% and 2.6%, respectively, after DA correction. We found that the ratio of anion to cation equivalent concentrations (AE/CE) and ion balance (anionscations) are not good indicators for aerosol acidity estimates, as the results in different labs did not agree well with each other. In situ aerosol pH calculated from the ISORROPIA II thermodynamic equilibrium model with measured ion and ammonia concentrations showed a similar trend and good agreement across the 10 labs. Our results indicate that although there are important uncertainties in aerosol ion concentration measurements, the estimated aerosol pH from the ISORROPIA II model is more consistent.",
1346,"Formation of sinkholes along the shore of the dead sea preliminary investigation In the past decade, hundreds of collapse-sinkholes have formed along the Dead Sea coastlines in Israel and Jordan, causing severe damage to the regional infrastructure. We present some preliminary results combining geophysical methods, boreholes, and aerial photographs in order to understand the mechanism of sinkhole formation. Boreholes and seismic refraction indicate a ubiquitous salt layer at the subsurface below the sinkhole sites. Aerial photographs and seismic reflection imply that sinkhole sites form along faults. We suggest that the Dead Sea sinkholes were formed by dissolution of the salt layer, where the halite-sub-saturated groundwater invaded through faults. The invasion of the fresh groundwater from the west was triggered by the decrease in the Dead Sea level and the consequent eastward retreat of the Dead Sea shoreline which has lead the fresh-saline water interface to migrate eastward.",
1347,"Spatial interrelations and multi-scale sources of soil heavy metal variability in a typical urban-rural transition area in Yangtze River Delta region of China Information and knowledge about the spatial variability and multi-scale sources of soil heavy metal variability are important for risk assessment, soil remediation, as well as effective management recommendations. Topsoil samples (0-20 cm) (n=330) were collected from Luhe County, China. Geostatistical multivariate factorial kriging with robust estimates of variograms, spatial overly analysis and indicator kriging were applied to explore the correlations among soil heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Hg) across different spatial scales, identify the sources of spatial variability, and evaluate the potential risk of soil contamination. High variability of soil heavy metals was observed and the correlations among the selected soil heavy metals in the study area depend on spatial scale. Copper, Zn, Cr, and Ni at short-range scale (2 km) are mainly controlled by geology (bed rock), while land use greatly affected the long-range variations of Cd and Hg. The strong correlations between Cr and Ni at short- and long-range (11 km) scale indicate that the sources of Cr and Ni are predominately geochemical. However, anthropogenic activities had profound impacts on the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Hg. The potential contamination risk, defined here as measured soil heavy metal concentrations which exceeded the background values of Chinese Environmental Quality Standard for Soils, was observed in Cu, Zn and Pb, and the areas covered 3%, 3.4%, and 1.4%, respectively. The possible sources of Cu and Zn contamination can be considered as the current and historic industrial emissions from Dachang industrial zone, and the potential areas of Pb contamination could be attributed to the industrial emissions from Dachang industrial zone, small factories and heavy traffic flows in/nearby downtown area of the county. While the Hg contamination risk was closely related to the widely use of Hg-related pesticide during 1940-1970s. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1348,"Eruptive history and magmatic evolution of the 1.9 kyr Plinian dacitic Chiltepe Tephra from Apoyeque volcano in west-central Nicaragua The youngest dacitic Plinian eruption in west-central Nicaragua, forming the 18 km(3) Chiltepe Tephra (CT), occurred about nineteen hundred years ago at Apoyeque stratovolcano, which dominates the Chiltepe volcanic complex 15 km north of the capital Managua, where the CT is 2 m thick. We have traced the CT from its proximal facies at the crater rim, through the medial facies in the lowlands around Apoyeque, and to the distal facies up to 550 km offshore in the Pacific. While medial and distal facies consist of widespread Plinian fall deposits, the proximal facies reveals the complexity of this eruption, which we divide into four phases (I-IV). Interaction of rising magma with a pre-existing crater lake generated the phreatomagmatic opening phase I of the eruption, which produced ash fall with accretionary lapilli. Phase II marked a rapid change to persistent magmatic activity that yielded several large Plinian eruptions, declining through a period of unstable eruption conditions, followed by a short hiatus. Phase III began with unstable conditions, probably as a result of eastward migration and widening of the vent, leading to a second period of Plinian eruptions with three major events reaching magma discharge rates five times larger than those of phase II. Phase III again declined through unstable eruption conditions before magmatic activity terminated. Numerous explosions in the shallow hydrothermal system during the final phase IV resulted in the formation of a phreatic tuff ring on the rim of Apoyeque crater. The white, highly-vesicular, dacitic CT pumice contains plagioclase (An(45-68)), orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and minor hornblende, apatite and titanomagnetite phenocrysts. A very subordinate fraction of gray pumice has the highest crystal content, the least evolved bulk-rock, but the most evolved matrix-glass composition. The CT dacite has two unusual compositional features: (1) all white dacite has the same melt (matrix-glass) composition such that variations in bulk-rock compositions (64-68 wt% SiO2) simply reflect different phenocryst contents of 10-35%, interpreted as the result of gradual phenocryst settling in the magma chamber. (2) Abundant olivine crystals with a bimodal distribution in Mg# (modes at Mg# = 0.75 and Mg# = 0.8) are dispersed throughout the erupted dacite. These are clearly out of equilibrium with the dacitic melt and are interpreted as xenocrysts derived from the basaltic Nejapa-Miraflores volcanic lineament that intersects the Chiltepe volcanic complex and was contemporaneously active. Thermobarometric estimates place the dacitic CT magma reservoir in the upper crust (< 250 MPa), with a temperature of about 890A degrees C and about 5 wt% water dissolved in the melt. Comparing water and chlorine contents with respective solubility models suggests that volatile degassing began in the magma reservoir and triggered the CT eruption. From the vertical compositional variation pattern of the CT we deduce that the conduit tapped the magma chamber not at the top but from the side, at some deeper level, and that subsequent magma withdrawal was governed by both variations in discharge rate and possible upward migration and/or widening of the conduit entrance.",
1349,"The social and political construction of latrines in rural Ethiopia This study seeks to understand the complexity of efforts to improve sanitation practices in the infrastructure-restricted and environmentally vulnerable setting of two rural districts of the Wolaita Zone, South Ethiopia. It seeks to simultaneously address micro-level behavioural and social determinants of sanitation, on the one hand, and political and environmental drivers, on the other hand. We draw on analysis of secondary information and own survey comprising structured interviews and direct observations in 368 households in 11 villages as well as 20 semi-structured interviews with health workers and village leaders. We consecutively examine different sanitation drivers and then attempt to paint a complex picture of sanitation situation in a given context. We found high latrine coverage and use but low functional quality of latrines implying uncertain benefits to human health. We attribute this pattern to relationships between the political construction of latrines (political commitment to sanitation characterized by the command-and-control nature of Ethiopian governance), socially constructed perceptions of symbolic risks and benefits of sanitation, and neglect of sanitation technologies within an environmental context.",
1350,"Spatiotemporal vegetation cover variations associated with climate change and ecological restoration in the Loess Plateau Vegetation is an important component of terrestrial ecosystems, and it plays an important role in preventing desertification and conserving soil and water in arid and semi-arid regions. This study examined the spatial distribution and temporal variations of vegetation cover in the Loess Plateau over the last three decades using a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the long-term data record (LTDR) and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) between 1981 and 2010, along with daily climate datasets. Furthermore, we assessed the relationships between the vegetation, climate variables (i.e., temperature and precipitation), and human activities, particularly the ""Grain to Green"" restoration program. The greenness of the vegetation cover in the Loess Plateau exhibited a significant increase from the northwest to the southeast. Generally, the NDVI exhibited an increase of 0.0015 year(-1) (P<0.01) from 1981 to 2010 over the entire plateau, and the rate was particularly high over the last decade. The NDVI increases with a rate of more than 0.01 year(-1) during 1991-2000 were distributed throughout the Ziwuling and Huanglongshan Forests in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, and in the Lvliang and Taihang Mountains, Shanxi Province. However, the distinct feature of the NDVI, namely, its increase of more than 0.01 year(-1) in 2001-2010, was associated with key areas of ecological restoration in Yulin and Yan'an in Shaanxi Province. The vegetation cover was largely improved within the last decade due to the ""Grain to Green"" program. However, revegetation still has great potential in the Huangfuchuan, Kuyehe, Wudinghe, and Yanhe watersheds in the future. In response to global warming, the phenology timing in the Loess Plateau was 3.9 days (1991-2000) and 6.6 days (2001-2010) earlier in spring compared with 1981-1990, and the end of the fall growing season was delayed 3.6 days and 9.6 days, respectively, over the past three decades. The significant and positive partial correlations (R>0.5, P<0.05) between the temperature and the NDVI occurred in the central and southeastern parts of the plateau; this finding indicates that higher temperatures promote the growth of vegetation in less water-stressed areas. However, a negative impact of vegetation degradation due to climate warming was found in the northwestern Loess Plateau. The permafrost slowly degraded in the northwestern Loess Plateau, causing a decrease in the water content of the topsoil, eventually leading to the adverse effects on vegetation.

1351,"Mixed silica-alumina oxide as sorbent for dyes and metal ions removal from aqueous solutions and wastewaters Wastewaters containing organic and inorganic contaminants such as dyes, heavy metal ions, salts, and surfactants are considered to be a serious environmental problem in human society. Adsorption is the most popular technique for wastewater treatment. In this paper, a new mesoporous silica-alumina oxide (97% SiO2, 3% Al2O3) synthesized by pyrogenic method was proposed as a sorbent for acid (C.I. Acid Orange 7), reactive (C.I. Reactive Black 5) and direct (C.I. Direct Blue 71) dyes as well as for heavy metal (Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II)) ions removal from the aqueous solutions and wastewaters. The batch method was employed. The parameters such as phases contact time (1-360 min), initial metal and dyes concentrations (10, 20, 30 mg/L), effect of hydrochloric acid concentration (0.1-6.0 M), anionic surfactant (0.1-1.0 g/L) and salt (5-20 g NaCl/L) as well as wastewater decolorization were studied. The kinetic and equilibrium studies were also performed. An equilibrium time of 1 min and >240 min was required for the adsorption of heavy metal ions and dyes onto mixed oxide, respectively. The experimental data were better fitted to the Freundlich equation than to the Langmuir one. The potentiometric titrations indicated that dyes and heavy metal ions adsorption influence the structure of electrical double layer at the mixed oxide - liquid interface which was evidenced by changes in the solid surface charge density. The results showed that the mixed oxide could be an effective adsorbent especially for heavy metal ions removal from aqueous and industrial wastewaters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
1352,"Origin and K-Ar age of the phreatomagmatic breccia at the Trepca Pb-Zn-Ag skarn deposit, Kosovo: Implications for ore-forming processes The Trepca Pb-Zn-Ag skarn deposit in Kosovo is spatially and temporarily related to the phreatomagmatic breccia of Oligocene age (similar to 23Ma). The deposit shows features typical for skarn deposits worldwide, including a stage of isochemical metamorphism, a prograde stage of an anhydrous, low oxygen and low sulfur fugacity character, and a retrograde stage characterized by an increase in the water activity as well as by an increase in oxygen and sulfur fugacities. The mineralization is hosted by the recrystallized Upper Triassic limestone. The prograde mineralization consists mainly of Ca-Fe-Mn +/- Mg pyroxenes. The host recrystallized limestone at the contact with the prograde (skarn) mineralization has an increased content of Fe, Mn, Mo, As, Au, Cs, Ga, REE and Y suggesting their transport by infiltrating magmatic fluids. The decreased delta C-13 and delta O-18 values reflect the contribution of magmatic CO2. The retrograde mineral assemblage comprises ilvaite, magnetite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite, pyrite, Ca-Fe-Mn +/- Mg carbonates and quartz. Hydrothermal ore minerals, mostly galena, sphalerite and pyrite, were deposited contemporaneously with the retrograde stage of the skarn development. Syn-ore and post-ore carbonates reflect the diminishing influence of magmatic CO2. Syn-ore carbonates are enriched in Fe, Mg, Mn, many chalcophile elements, including Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn, as well as in Au, Y and REE. The post-ore stage accompanied the precipitation of a significant amount of Ca-rich carbonates including travertine deposits at the deposit surface. The phreatomagmatic breccia was developed along a NW dipping contact between the ore bearing recrystallized limestone and the overlying schist. It has an inverted cone shape with vertical extension up to 800 m and a diameter of up to 150 m. The upper part of the diatreme (an underground segment of the phreatomagmatic breccia) is characterized by the presence of a hydrothermally altered rootless quartz-latite dyke surrounded by an unsorted polymict breccia mantle. Despite the alteration processes, the dyke has a preserved porphyritic texture. Partly preserved sanidine, accompanied with a mixture of muscovite and quartz, reflects a near-neutral to weakly acidic environment. The clasts of country rocks and skarn mineralization underwent intense milling and mixing due to repeated magmatic penetrations. Sericitization of the breccia matrix, locally accompanied with minor kaolinitization, point to an increased water activity under near-neutral to weakly acidic conditions. Large fragments originally composed of anhydrous skarn minerals (pyroxenes) are usually completely altered to a mixture of fibroradial magnetite, quartz and various amounts of carbonates suggesting an increase in oxygen fugacity. Their pyrite rims reflect that the increase in oxygen fugacity was followed by an increase in sulfur fugacity. The clast predominantly composed of Fe-sulfides and minor Bi-sulfides suggest that the increase in sulfur fugacity was locally sufficient to complete sulfidation of hedenbergite to pyrrhotite and/or pyrite. Although the phreatomagmatic breccia at the Trepca Pb-Zn-Ag skarn deposit does not carry significant amounts of ore mineralization, its formation was crucial for ore deposition. Phreatomagmatic explosions and formation of the breccia turned the system from the lithostatic to hydrostatic regime and triggered the retrograde stage increasing the water activity and oxygen fugacity in the system. In addition, cooling and decompression of the system contributed to more effective degassing of magmatic sulfur and increased the sulfur fugacity.",
1353,"Responses of Microbial Community Composition to Temperature Gradient and Carbon Steel Corrosion in Production Water of Petroleum Reservoir Oil reservoir production systems are usually associated with a temperature gradient and oil production facilities frequently suffer from pipeline corrosion failures. Both bacteria and archaea potentially contribute to biocorrosion of the oil production equipment. Here the response of microbial populations from the petroleum reservoir to temperature gradient and corrosion of carbon steel coupons were investigated under laboratory condition. Carbon steel coupons were exposed to production water from a depth of 1809 m of Jiangsu petroleum reservoir (China) and incubated for periods of 160 and 300 days. The incubation temperatures were set at 37, 55, and 65Â°C to monitoring mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms associated with anaerobic carbon steel corrosion. The results showed that corrosion rate at 55Â°C (0.162 Â± 0.013 mm year(-1)) and 37Â°C (0.138 Â± 0.008 mm year(-1)) were higher than that at 65Â°C (0.105 Â± 0.007 mm year(-1)), and a dense biofilm was observed on the surface of coupons under all biotic incubations. The microbial community analysis suggests a high frequency of bacterial taxa associated with families Porphyromonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Spirochaetaceae at all three temperatures. While the majority of known sulfate-reducing bacteria, in particular Desulfotignum, Desulfobulbus and Desulfovibrio spp., were predominantly observed at 37Â°C; Desulfotomaculum spp., Thermotoga spp. and Thermanaeromonas spp. as well as archaeal members closely related to Thermococcus and Archaeoglobus spp. were substantially enriched at 65Â°C. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the family Methanobacteriaceae were dominant at both 37 and 55Â°C; acetoclastic Methanosaeta spp. and methyltrophic Methanolobus spp. were enriched at 37Â°C. These observations show that temperature changes significantly alter the microbial community structure in production fluids and also affected the biocorrosion of carbon steel under anaerobic conditions.",
1354,"SWAT-simulated hydrological impact of land-use change in the Zanjanrood Basin, Northwest Iran Understanding the impacts of land-use changes on hydrology at the watershed scale can facilitate development of sustainable water resource strategies. This paper investigates the hydrological effects of land-use change in Zanjanrood basin, Iran. The water balance was simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (AVSWAT2000). Model calibration and uncertainty analysis were performed with sequential uncertainty fitting (SUFI-2). Simulation results from January 1998 to December 2002 were used for parameter calibration, and then the model was validated for the period of January 2003 to December 2004. The predicted monthly streamflow matched the observed values: during calibration the correlation coefficient was 0.86 and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient 0.79, compared with 0.80 and 0.79, respectively, during validation. The model was used to simulate the main components of the hydrological cycle, in order to study the effects of land-use changes in 1967, 1994 and 2007. The study reveals that during 1967 a 34.5% decrease of grassland with concurrent increases of shrubland (13.9%), rain-fed agriculture (12.1%), bare ground (5.5%) irrigated agriculture (2.2%), and urban area (0.7%) led to a 33% increase in the amount of surface runoff and a 22% decrease in the groundwater recharge. Furthermore, the area of sub-basins that was influenced by high runoff (14-28 mm) increased. The results indicate that the hydrological response to overgrazing and the replacing of rangelands (grassland and shrubland) with rain-fed agriculture and bare ground (badlands) is nonlinear and exhibits a threshold effect. The runoff rises dramatically when more than 60% of the rangeland is removed. For groundwater this threshold lies at an 80% decrease in rangeland. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
1355,"In situ and ex situ bioremediation of seleniferous soils from northwestern India PurposeSelenium (Se) toxicity or deficiency disorders are chiefly associated with Se concentration and speciation in soils. Elevated soil Se content may lead to contamination of water bodies and groundwaters due to the leaching caused by rainfall and irrigation. This study is focused on Se removal by in situ (biostimulation and bioaugmentation) and ex situ (soil washing) bioremediation as well as on its recovery.Materials and methodsIn this research, in situ bioremediation of Se-rich soil collected from rice fields in Ludhiana, Northwest India was studied in microcosms. The effect of biostimulation was determined by amending soil with different organic sources (fermentable, non-fermentable, and non-hydrolysable electron donors). The effect of bioaugmentation was determined by adding anaerobic granular sludge to the microcosms. With regard to ex situ bioremediation, the Se-rich soil was leached with water and the resulting leachate was biologically treated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor using lactate as electron donor. The UASB reactor was operated for 78days in different conditions of lactate (electron donor) dosing to achieve maximum Se removal and recovery as elemental Se(0) on the granular sludge. The effluent of the UASB reactor was regularly analyzed to determine Se removal efficiencies.Results and discussionThe effect of biostimulation and bioaugmentation showed no significant difference in terms of Se reduction profiles in the microcosms. This suggested that the indigenous Se-reducing microorganisms and oxidizable organic carbon present in the soil are sufficient for in situ soil bioremediation. During treatment of soil leachate in the UASB reactor, 90% Se removal was achieved irrespective of the lactate dosing and mineral salt medium composition of the reactor influent. Analysis of the granular sludge using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD) confirmed the presence of elemental Se on the granular sludge. The total Se concentration in the anaerobic granular sludge amounted to 43.5 (0.7) g Se per gram of granular sludge.Conclusions p id=Par4 In situ bioremediation achieved Se reduction in the Se-rich soil investigated. However, risk of Se re-oxidation and leaching into groundwater after in situ remediation cannot be disregarded. In contrast, during ex situ treatment, effluent from the UASB reactor contained less than the USEPA guideline value 5gL(-1) Se. This study showed biological treatment of Se-rich soils is suitable for cleaning the soil, Se recovery, and environmentally acceptable effluent discharge of the soil washing leachate treatment.",
1356,"Research and applications of membrane bioreactors in China: Progress and prospect In the past 15 years, remarkable progress has been achieved on the research and commercial applications of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology in China. The objective of this paper is then to critically review the research achievements and to specifically present commercial applications of MBR in China. A total of 722 scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals (600 Chinese papers and 122 English papers) written by Chinese authors from 1991 to 2006 and 254 full-scale MBR plants constructed in China were used as the analysis database. The number of articles published in journals together with organizations involved in MBR research saw a significant increase from 2001 to 2006, and much research progress was made during this period. From geographic distribution of these studies, it was found that the majority of the studies were carried out in North China, East China and North-East China. The research mainly focused on biomass separation MBR (BSMBR) with limited studies on extractive MBR (EMBR) and membrane aeration bioreactor (MABR), etc., and research contents included MBR configuration and type, membrane material and module, membrane fouling and control, characteristics of various wastewater treatment and other aspects like gas removal and microbial fermentation, etc. For commercial applications in China, a total of 254 MBR plants for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment were constructed by a lot of home-grown companies such as Tianjin Motimo Membrane Technology Co., Ltd. and Beijing Origin Water Technology Co., Ltd. and overseas-funded companies like Toray (Japan), Zenon (Canada), Mitsubishi-Rayon (Japan), etc. MBR plants with large treatment capacity will be built in future especially in North China due to the great need of water reclamation and reuse. Potential areas of MBR application include surface/drinking water treatment, gas diffusion and removal, membrane assisted fermentation for biological substance transformation and production, etc. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1357,"Seed morphology, germination and seedling characters in Ludwigia species (Onagraceae) in Nigeria as aids to identification Ludwigia, a pantropical genus, consists of 82 species distributed among 23 sections. Twenty five of these species occur in the Old World, including 8 of its 23 sections. A very diverse assemblage of Ludwigia species occurs in South America, where 45 of the 82 species occur, and which may have been the centre of origin for the genus and for the family. The species are mesophytic herbs, shrubs, or trees of tropical or subtropical regions, with several well-developed groups in temperate areas of North America and Asia. A few of the herbs are predominantly aquatic, and all of the species grow in wet places. In West Africa, they are represented by fourteen species (sixteen taxa), and nine species (eleven taxa) of these are found in Nigeria, where they concentrate around the coastal regions, lakes, lagoons, canals, rivers, seas, gutters and water-logged areas. Ludwigia species are often troublesome weeds in rice plantations, and often close navigation channels. They are also ornamental plants, and some of the species have found laboratory use as attachment hosts in the rearing of some insects. Some of the species of Ludwigia are used for toxicity assessment, others exert allelopathic effects on other plants; while all of them are rich in seed oils. Their medicinal property dates back to decades. They have use in the treatment of flatulence, constipation and dysentery, possess cintihepatotoxic activity, have anti-inflammatory properties, and in combination with other herbs are known to exert a diuretic and possibly haemostatic action on animals. The eleven taxa of Ludwigia found in Nigeria have well over 100 names as their synonyms. Ludwigia octovalvis complex and L. stenorraphe are both extremely polymorphic taxa and there are very numerous perplexing intermediates between the three subspecies oft. octovalvis complex. A detailed laboratory work on these species' seed forms, germination and seedling characters were carried out to resolve the ambiguity surrounding their classification. Seed morphological studies revealed that the seeds varied in their shapes and sizes. The largest seeds were observed in L. affinis while the smallest seeds were in L. decurrens. The nipples on the seeds in some of the species also varied in their sizes. Scarification experiments revealed that concentrated sulphuric acid and 1% copper sulphate solution had no positive effect. The best chemical agent for scarification was 1% potassium permanganate solution for 2 hours. However, mechanical scarification proved to be the best method for the seeds of L. leptocarpa, L. affinis and L. adscendens subsp. diffusa. Germination ecology experiments showed that for each taxon, some of the seeds germinated in the three types of soil. However, the degree and percentage as well as rime of initial germination varied among the species. Seven types of germination variants were observed among the species based on the mode as well as position of rupture of the seed coats during the onset of germination. These germination variants were phylogenetically related to one another. However, L. stenorraphe was isolated from the other species in its seed coat rupture pattern, and could therefore be said to mark one end of the evolutionary tree of the genus. Growth rate experiments showed that time of appearance of first foliar leaves varied among the species. The characters of the cotyledons also varied. They were either isocotyledonous or anisocotyledonous in the species. Variations were also observed in the sizes of the initial foliar leaves as well as their time of appearance. Leaf arrangement was opposite, alternate, or a combination of the two. The time of appearance of trichomes also varied among the species. The cotyledon venation pattern revealed that five major patterns existed in the species. The margin was either looped in some species, or partly fimbriate and partly looped in others. Variation was observed in the course of the primary Veins as well as positions of the secondary veins relative to the primary veins. The areolar cells showed variation in their sh pes and arrangements from species to species. The epidermal cells in these cotyledons were mostly nucleated at one end in L. abyssinica and L. erecta. The cells were rich in cellular inclusions while intercellular spaces often interrupted the arrangement of cells in all the species.",
1358,"Occurrence and distribution of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid in three major rivers of Xinjiang, China Drinking water is a main pathway of human exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). These two compounds have been identified in environmental waters worldwide, but little is known about their occurrence in Xinjiang. In this study, 155 water samples were obtained from 37 locations across Ulungur River, Manasi River, and Tarim River in Xinjiang, and were assessed by using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. PFOS and PFOA were detected in over 50% of the samples with mean concentrations of 3.194 ng/L for PFOS and 3.460 ng/L for PFOA. Spatial and regional distribution differences do exist among the three analyzed rivers. PFOS and PFOA in Manasi River were observed at the highest levels (especially in M10 and M11), but no aggravation occurred from 2014 to 2017. Seasonal variations of PFOS and PFOA concentrations showed that water samples collected during summer were higher than those in other three seasons. The occurrence, levels, and distribution patterns of PFOS and PFOA were investigated in the present study, which provides useful theory and data support for human health risk assessment. The findings of the present study can be considered for controlling these water pollutants in environmental waters.",
1359,"Aerosol spectral absorption in the Mexico City area: results from airborne measurements during MILAGRO/INTEX B This paper presents estimates of the spectral solar absorption due to atmospheric aerosols during the 2006 MILAGRO/INTEX-B (Megacity Initiative-Local And Global Research Observations/Phase B of the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment) field campaign. The aerosol absorption was derived from measurements of the spectral solar radiation and the spectral aerosol optical depth made on the J31 aircraft flying over the Gulf of Mexico and over Mexico City. We present the spectral single scattering albedo (SSA) and aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) for two flights over the Gulf of Mexico and three flights over Mexico City for wavelengths from 350 to approximately 1650 nm. The spectral aerosol optical properties of each case are different and illustrate the variability of the aerosol optical properties in the Mexico City area. The results can be described in terms of three different wavelength regions: The 350-500 nm region where the aerosol absorption often falls off sharply presumably due to organic carbonaceous particles and windblown dust; the 500-1000 nm region where the decrease with wavelength is slower presumably due to black carbon; and the near infrared spectral region (1000 nm to 1650 nm) where it is difficult to obtain reliable results since the aerosol absorption is relatively small and the gas absorption dominates. However, there is an indication of a small and somewhat wavelength independent absorption in the region beyond 1000 nm. For one of the flights over the Gulf of Mexico near the coastline it appears that a cloud/fog formation and evaporation led to an increase of absorption possibly due to a water shell remaining on the particles after the cloud/fog had dissipated. For two of the Mexico City cases, the single scattering albedo is roughly constant between 350-500 nm consistent with other Mexico City results. In three of the cases a single absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) fits the aerosol absorption optical depth over the entire wavelength range of 350 to 1650 nm relatively well (r(2)>0.86).",
1360,"Effects of heavy metals on plants and resistance mechanisms. A state-of-the-art report with special reference to literature published in Chinese journals GOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: As one of the consequences of heavy metal pollution in soil, water and air, plants are contaminated by heavy metals in some parts of China. To understand the effects of heavy metals upon plants and the resistance mechanisms, would make it possible to use plants for cleaning and remediating heavy metal-polluted sites. METHODS: The research results on the effects of heavy metals on plants and resistant mechanisms are compiled from Chinese publications from scientific journals and university journals, mostly published during the last decade. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Effects of heavy metals on plants result in growth inhibition, structure damage, a decline of physiological and biochemical activities as well as of the function of plants. The effects and bioavailability of heavy metals depend on many factors, such as environmental conditions, pH, species of element, organic substances of the media and fertilization, plant species. But, there are also studies on plant resistance mechanisms to protect plants against the toxic effects of heavy metals such as combining heavy metals by proteins and expressing of detoxifying enzyme and nucleic acid, these mechanisms are integrated to protect the plants against injury by heavy metals. CONCLUSIONS: There are two aspects on the interaction of plants and heavy metals. On one hand, heavy metals show negative effects on plants. On the other hand, plants have their own resistance mechanisms against toxic effects and for detoxifying heavy metal pollution. RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTLOOK: To study the effects of heavy metals on plants and mechanisms of resistance, one must select crop cultivars and/or plants for removing heavy metals from soil and water. More highly resistant plants can be selected especially for a remediation of the pollution site. The molecular mechanisms of resistance of plants to heavy metals should be studied further to develop the actual resistance of these plants to heavy metals. Understanding the bioavailability of heavy metals is advantageous for plant cultivation and phytoremediation. Decrease in the bioavailability to farmlands would reduce the accumulation of heavy metals in food. Alternatively, one could increase the bioavailability of plants to extract more heavy metals.",
1361,"Effectiveness of exogenous salicylic acid on root and shoot growth attributes, productivity, and water use efficiency of water-deprived fennel genotypes This study was carried out to investigate the response of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) to water deficit and exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA). Six fennel genotypes, from Iran (namely 'Urmia', 'Hamadan', 'Kerman', 'Shiraz', 'Birjand' and 'Yazd') were subjected to two levels of irrigation consisting of either irrigation after 35% (control) or 75% depletion of available soil water (water deficit) and 3 levels of treatment with SA (0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 mM). Root growth attributes, yield and yield components as well as irrigation water use efficiencies for seed, oil and dry masses of the shoot and whole plant were studied. Shoot dry mass, grain yield and essential oil yield were decreased due to water deficit. Furthermore, root growth attributes were decreased under water deficit, except for root diameter and dry mass, and root/shoot ratio. With the exception of irrigation water use efficiency for seed yield, all irrigation water use efficiency aspects were increased when fennel was subjected to water deprivation. Fennel genotypes were grouped according to their stress susceptibility indices (SSI) into drought-tolerant, moderately drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive groups. The largest drought-induced decreases in root length, root dry mass, root length density, number of fruits per umbel, seed yield, 1000-seed weight, seed essential oil yield, and irrigation water use efficiency for seed and oil yield were observed in genotype 'Hamadan' from the drought-sensitive group. Salicylic acid led to increases in root growth and yield attributes, seed essential oil content and yield, and irrigation water use efficiency aspects under both moisture conditions. Overall, foliar application of SA appeared to attenuate the negative effects of drought stress on fennel through increases in most of the root growth and yield attributes and the attenuation was more substantial in the drought-tolerant set of fennel genotypes.",

The methods of radiometry, IGS, XRF, MS-ICP, OES-ICP, RChA were used. It was established that the radiation background in the examined areas is high, but does not pose a risk to human health. In the majority of the transboundary watercourses, the chemical toxicity of waters exceeds for 2-12 times the regulatory value set in the Republic of Kazakhstan for drinking water. Uranium contributes 37% to this indicator.",1
1363,"Optimization of statistical and machine learning hybrid models for groundwater potential mapping Determining areas of high groundwater potential is important for exploitation, management, and protection of water resources. This study assesses the spatial distribution of groundwater potential in the Zarrinehroud watershed of Kurdistan Province, Iran using combinations of five statistical and machine learning algorithms - frequency ratio (FR), radial basis function (RBF), index of entropy (IOE), evidential belief function (EBF) and fuzzy art map (FAM). To accomplish this, 1448 well locations in the study area were randomly divided into two data sets for training (70%= 1013 locations) and validation (30%= 435 locations) based on the holdout method. Fourteen factors that can affect the presence or absence of groundwater were identified, measured, and mapped using ArcGIS and SAGA-GIS software. The models were used to predict the locations of groundwater based on suitable combinations of the conditioning factors to produce groundwater potential maps. The probability of groundwater at any location was classified as low, moderate, high, or very high based on natural breaks in the data spectrum. The model predictions were tested for validity and their success was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, standard errors (SE), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (SST), specificity (SPF) and accuracy (ACC), and the Friedman test. The performance assessments of groundwater potential predictions using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) showed that the FR-RBF model had very good performance (AUC= 0.889, ACC= 87.51). FR-FAM (AUC= 0.869, ACC= 84.67), EBF-FAM (AUC= 0.864, ACC= 84.42), EBF-RBF (AUC= 0.854, ACC= 83.94), FR-IOE (AUC= 0.836, ACC= 83.62), and EBF-IOE (AUC= 0.833, ACC= 80.42) also had acceptable performance. The results of the Friedman test also show that there are significant differences between the models and the highest mean rank was generated by the FR-FAM model (3.642). Therefore, the hybrid models can be used to increase the accuracy of groundwater-prediction models in the study region and perhaps in similar settings.",
1364,"Performance of hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant in China: A systematic evaluation during 7-year operation Ultrafiltration (UF) was implemented as a process upgrade in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) with a scale of 100,000 m(3).d(-1), and the performance was systematically investigated over seven years of operation. The results showed that the UF system exhibited excellent rejection of particles and improved the removals of organics by 9.0-14.7%. The annual average UF flux decreased from 28.37 to 16.51 L.m(-2).h(-1), and it was necessary to employ various cleaning approaches at an increasing frequency for maintaining stable operation. Compared to the initial scenario, the total cost per m(3) of water for the UF system after 7-year operation increased by 55%. The cost of membrane replacement, energy, waste water and chemicals played a decisive role on operating cost in the lifecycle of the UF system. The content of cations (i.e., Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Mn and Fe), biological metabolites and organic substances in the cake layer increased significantly during long-term UF filtration, which not only aggravated membrane fouling but also affected the organic composition of the drinking water. The excellent integrity of the UF membrane during the 7-year operation was sufficient to prevent breakthrough of the organic substances from metabolic activity of microorganisms and to ensure biological safety of the permeate.",1
1365,"Geochemical and Isotopic Study of the Xiong'er Volcanic Rocks at the Southern Margin of the North China Craton: Petrogenesis and Tectonic Implications The Xiong'er volcanic rocks constitute a large Paleo-Mesoproterozoic volcanic belt along the southern margin of the North China Craton. The volcanic rocks can be petrographically and geochemically classified into the basaltic andesite-andesite and dacite-rhyolite series, with the former being the dominant component of the Xiong'er volcanic rocks. The volcanic rocks of the dacite-rhyolite series have been derived from the wet and low- temperature differentiation of the basaltic andesite-andesite series at shallow depth, suggested by regional geological, lithological, and geochemical studies. In addition, crustal assimilation was involved in the magmas to form volcanic rocks of the dacite-rhyolite series, as suggested by low epsilon(Nd(t)) values (-8.09 to similar to-9.99) and high Th/Yb ratios (1.7-2.7). Some of volcanic rocks from the basaltic andesite-andesite series show features of high-Mg andesites (HMA), being characterized by high MgO contents and Mg numbers, representing the most primitive end-member of the magmatic series in the Xiong'er volcanic rocks, whereas other volcanic rocks of the basaltic andesite-andesite series (low- magnesium andesites) can be assigned to evolved andesites because of their low MgO and relatively high SiO2 contents. In the crystallization sequence of Opx -> Cpx -> Pl from the HMAs, through low- magnesium andesites, to dacite-rhyolite series, inferred by the covariation of major and trace elements, the early crystallization of plagioclases could have been suppressed as a result of high water content. The Xiong'er volcanic rocks are characterized by arclike geochemical signatures (large ion lithophile element and light rare earth element enrichments and negative Ta-Nb-Ti anomalies) as well as remarkably high Fe-Ti and high field strength element concentrations. These features can be interpreted in terms of the subduction-related hydrous melting of a mantle that experienced siliceous melt-metasomatismduring the Archean-Paleoproterozoic hot subduction in the Trans-North China Orogen. Thus, we interpret the Xiong'er volcanic rocks to have formed at an active continental margin. This implies that the North China Craton, like other continental components (e. g., North America, Greenland, Baltica, Amazonia, and other cratons) of the Columbia supercontinent, also underwent a subduction-related outgrowth along its southern margin during Paleo-Mesoproterozoic time.",
1366,"Spatial-temporal variability in water quality and macro-invertebrate assemblages in the Upper Mara River basin, Kenya Tropical rivers display profound temporal and spatial heterogeneity in terms of environmental conditions. This aspect needs to be considered when designing a monitoring program for water quality in rivers. Therefore, the physico-chemical composition and the nutrient loading of the Upper Mara River and its two main tributaries, the Amala and Nyangores were monitored. Initial daily, and later a weekly monitoring schedule for 4 months spanning through the wet and dry seasons was adopted. Benthic macro-invertebrates were also collected during the initial sampling to be used as indicators of water quality. The aim of the current study was to investigate the physico-chemical status and biological integrity of the Upper Mara River basin. This was achieved by examining trends in nutrient concentrations and analyzing the structure, diversity and abundance of benthic macro-invertebrates in relation to varying land use patterns. Sampling sites were selected based on catchment land use and the level of human disturbance, and using historical records of previous water quality studies. River water pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity (EC), temperature, and turbidity were determined in situ. All investigated parameters except iron and manganese had concentration values within allowable limits according to Kenyan and international standards for drinking water. The Amala tributary is more mineralized and also shows higher levels of pH and EC than water from the Nyangores tributary. The latter, however, has a higher variability in both the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. The variability in TP and TN concentrations increases downstream for both tributaries and is more pronounced for TN than for TP. Macro-invertebrate assemblages responded to the changes in land use and water quality in terms of community composition and diversity. The study recommends detailed continuous monitoring of the water quality at shorter time intervals and to identify key macro-invertebrate taxa that can be used to monitor changes of the water quality in rivers of the Mara basin as a result of anthropogenic changes.

The occurrence and removal of micro-organic pollutants in EWWTPs were still not well known. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their typical derivatives (SPAHs) including the oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs), chlorinated PAHs (ClPAHs), and methyl PAHs (MPAHs) were investigated in an EWWTP in Guangdong Province, China. The concentrations of the Î£6 OPAHs (114-384Â ng/L) were higher than the Î£16 PAHs (92-250Â ng/L), and much higher than the Î£4 MPAHs (13-64Â ng/L) and Î£9 ClPAHs (2-3Â ng/L) in the EWWTP and the effluent receiving river. The total removal efficiencies of the PAHs, OPAHs, MPAHs, and ClPAHs in the EWWTP (43â€‰Â±â€‰14%, 41â€‰Â±â€‰7%, 55â€‰Â±â€‰16%, and 18â€‰Â±â€‰4%) were lower than the traditional WWTPs, probably due to the lower concentration of the sludge in the ecological treatment. The advanced treatment process (microfiltration and UV disinfection treatment) contributed much less (0-20%) to the whole removal efficiency than the ecological treatment (80-100%). The effluent from the EWWTP slightly reduced the PAHs and SPAHs concentrations in the receiving river. The high concentrations of the PAHs and SPAHs in the receiving river were similar to the influent of the EWWTP, indicating that some untreated wastewater was directly discharged to the river, especially in the upstream.",
1368,"Evaluation of sustainable groundwater utilization using index methods (WQI and IWQI), multivariate analysis, and GIS: the case of AkÅŸehir District (Konya/Turkey) AkÅŸehir district is one of the regions where significant agricultural production and industrial activities are carried out. Groundwater is the most important water resource in this region used for different purposes, especially for drinking and irrigation water. In order to ensure sustainable water management in the study area, it is necessary to reveal the drinking and irrigation water quality of groundwater and to take precautions and determine the management plans. In the present study, groundwater quality was evaluated using water quality index methods (WQI and IWQI) and statistical analyses to determine the sustainable and most appropriate usage of groundwater. In addition, spatial distribution maps were prepared using GIS for drinking and irrigation WQI assessments of the groundwater. A total of 31 groundwater samples were collected from wells in October 2018 and physicochemical analysis results were evaluated. According to the results obtained with the WQI method, all groundwater samples in the study area are definitely not suitable for use as drinking water. According to the results obtained by the IWQI method, samples S23, S24, S25, S27, S28, S29, and S31 especially are not suitable for use as irrigation water. Statistical evaluations support the results obtained from WQI and IWQI methods. Also, factor analysis indicates that anthropogenic pollution, especially agricultural applications, is effective on the chemical and quality characteristics of groundwater samples in addition to the geological properties. As seen in the spatial distribution maps for WQI and IWQI results, while the quality of groundwaters around DoÄŸruÃ¶zÃ¼ and ErdoÄŸdu is not suitable for drinking water, the groundwater quality in the north-east of the study area is also unusable for irrigation water. Consequently, the use of groundwater in the region as drinking water can be dangerous for human health and alternative drinking water resources should be investigated. In addition, in order to ensure the sustainable use of groundwater, it is necessary to control agricultural activities in the region, to monitor the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and to encourage organic farming practices in the region.",1
1369,"Petroleum Generation, Retention, and Expulsion in Lacustrine Shales Using an Artificial Thermal Maturation Approach: Implications for the In-Situ Conversion of Shale Oil Organic-rich lacustrine shales with medium-low maturity in China have considerable potential to produce oil with the aid of in-situ underground conversion technology. Two shale samples from the Qingshankou Formation in the Songliao Basin and the Chang 7 Member in the Ordos Basin were selected for semi-closed pyrolysis, and the pyrolysis products and solid residues were subjected to detailed organic geochemical analysis and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) analyses to elucidate the evolution of organic matter; to quantitatively and qualitatively characterize the generation, retention, and expulsion of hydrocarbons; and to explore the required optimal temperature ranges for the two shales during in situ heating. The results showed that (a) the labile organic matter in the samples was progressively converted into hydrocarbons and (b) the cumulative yield of the retained oil continuously decreased as the temperature increased, the expelled oil reached its peak value at 400-450 degrees C, and oil cracking into gas occurred above 350 degrees C. The characteristics of the oil compositions indicated that hydrocarbons are directly decomposed from kerogen in the studied lacustrine shale samples, instead of being formed by bitumen cracking. Oil retention in the artificially mature samples is associated with organic richness, and large amounts of oil retained in samples can lead to a strong charging effect in FIB-SEM images, which is expressed as strong brightness. Mass balance calculations demonstrated that the maximum values of the oil expulsion efficiency are 82.59% for the Chang 7 shale sample and 96.27% for the Qingshankou shale sample at 350 degrees C. Meanwhile, substantial light hydrocarbons are produced and expelled in the pyrolysis of the latter sample. During an in-situ conversion process, the optimal temperature ranges are suggested to be 400-450 degrees C for the Chang 7 shale and 350-425 degrees C for the Qjngshankou shale. In these ranges, most labile organic matter can be converted into hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon expulsion efficiency is higher, and oil is characterized by appropriate mobility as well as a relatively lower secondary cracking degree.",
1370,"[High-Frequency Dynamics of Water Quality and Phytoplankton Community in Inflowing River Mouth of Xin'anjiang Reservoir, China] The tail of the reservoir is the unstable zone regarding water quality and phytoplankton community. Therefore, it is the crucial zone in aquatic ecosystem transitions. To understand the transition characteristics and driving mechanisms of water environment dynamics, high-frequency monitoring of the water environment and phytoplankton community in the tail of a deep and large reservoir, the Xin'anjiang Reservoir in southeast of China, was conducted using a water quality monitoring buoy and three-day interval water sampling during 18 months. Results show clear seasonal thermal and oxygen stratification in the river mouth of the reservoir. The nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations also show stratifying phenomena during the thermal stratification period. Heavy rain and inflow quickly consume the stratification. Nutrient concentrations were highly dynamic in the river mouth. The total phosphorus ranges from 0.011 mgÂ·L(-1) to 0.188 mgÂ·L(-1), and total nitrogen ranges from 0.75 mgÂ·L(-1) to 2.76 mgÂ·L(-1). Dissolved phosphorus comprised 56% of total phosphorus, and dissolved nitrogen occupied 88% of total nitrogen, respectively. Nutrient concentrations were influenced strongly by rainfall intensity and inflow rate. Total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were significantly related to the three-day accumulated rainfall. Nutrient concentrations in the flood season (March to June) were significantly higher than in the non-flood season (P<0.001). Seasonal phytoplankton proliferation also significantly influenced by total phosphorus concentration. The phytoplankton community changes significantly with seasons and flood events. Bacillariophytea was generally dominant throughout the year, with the predominant genus of Fragilaria spp., Cyclotella spp., Synedra spp., and Melosira spp. Cyanophyta biomass peaked in July, August, and September, with the dominant genus of Aphanizomenon spp., Microcystis spp., and Oscillatoria spp. Apart from the high temperature, storm inflow events also triggered Cyanophyta proliferation. The proliferation of Chlorophyta was similar to Cyanophyta, with the predominant genus of Pediastrum spp. and Closterium spp.. While the Cryptophyta biomass peaked during March to May, with the predominant genus of Cryptomonas spp.. Redundancy analysis shows that the influence factors of phytoplankton community dynamics include the inflow rate, temperature, water level, water transparency, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and nitrogen to phosphorus ratio. The meteorological and hydrological factors were major factors for phytoplankton dynamics during later autumn and winter, while the nutrient will be the co-driving factors of phytoplankton community dynamics during summer and early autumn. The research confirmed the huge influence of the intensity rainfall event on the water environment in reservoirs and described the key environmental conditions for phytoplankton community dynamics. The research is useful for the design of the monitoring and forecasting system for water safety in drinking water source reservoirs.",
1371,"Nature of Transboundary Water Conflicts: Issues of Complexity and the Enabling Conditions for Negotiated Cooperation Water access, demand, usage and management become complex due to the crossing of multiple boundaries: political, social and jurisdictional, as well as physical, ecological and biogeochemical. This paper focuses on a particular class of complex water problems: the allocation of transboundary water (TBW) among competing riparians with conflicting needs. The complexity in TBW allocation lies in the dynamic consequences of competition that arise from the interconnections and feedbacks among actors, processes and institutions operating in the knowledge and political communities. Consequently, many TBW allocation issues become contingent upon the dynamic changes that occur within the knowledge and political communities as well as the interactions and feedback occurring between these two communities. In addition to understanding and addressing the contingent contextual factors that span the knowledge and political communities, resolving complex TBW problems also needs to be guided by contextual application of two global principles - equity and sustainability - as anchors to accommodate the values and interests of the stakeholders involved in a TBW problem. This paper examines the process that led to the relatively successful resolution of conflict over allocating the waters in the Indus basin between India and Pakistan. Using the Indus water treaty as an illustrative case, the paper identifies three enabling conditions that underlie the effectiveness of negotiating a treaty and its continuous efficacy in addressing TBW problems. The paper argues that effective resolution of complex TBW problems is rooted in the nature of the negotiation process, the provisions in the negotiated agreement and the establishment of institutional means to solve emergent problems that are related to the original agreement.",
1372,"EVALUATION AND ZONING BY MASS REMOVAL PHENOMENA (MRP) ALONG THE ECUADORIAN HEAVY CRUDE OIL PIPELINE ROUTE The occurrence of MRP is related to the external geodynamics of the Earth's crust, which are the most common processes occurring each year around the world. In the case of Ecuador, these events, within the ROW (Right Of Way), have affected the integrity of the ROW, bringing dangerous OCP pipe bursts and thus oil spills affecting the surrounding terrain and water bodies. Landslides are phenomena subject to a degree of uncertainty due to the different geological - geotechnical areas involved; this research tries to determine the susceptibility of the terrain to landslide using these intrinsic factors, environmental properties (topography, moisture, lithology) and other variables that could trigger these conditions (e.g. rain, earthquakes). Each factor defines an index of influence for a given site when combined and correlated to the threat of a specific severity, which allows for a value to be ratesed on its susceptibility. The recognition of the threats and the susceptibility of the terrain to landslide is a very useful tool to identify and divide the land into homogeneous areas and scale them according to their actual or potential threat. The mapping is performed on an area where there is occurrence data of the events or phenomena. This data can then be extrapolated to determine the potential threat in areas where no data exists. The collected information is processed using GIS software to be spatially represented information. Maps generated with this methodology are used and applied as key tools in decision making processes for land use planning. The result of their application also increases the understanding of natural phenomena in the study area, leading to an efficient and sustainable development. This methodology is not intended under any circumstances, to ignore the geotechnical field and laboratory data, and it can not predict the kind of slippage that could occurs.",
1373,"Temporal and spatial dynamics of land use and land cover changes in derived savannah hydrological basin of Enugu State, Nigeria The combined effects of climate change and aggressive anthropogenic activities linked to urban developments have resulted in major land use and land cover (LULC) changes in eastern Nigeria. These LULC changes have grave implications for water resources and the surface hydrology. This study was aimed at specifically quantifying the extent of LULC changes and the implications for surface hydrology of the study area. The study investigated the spatiotemporal effects of LULC on the hydrology of the basin of Enugu State, Nigeria, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT model has been extensively used to study watershed response to rainfall and LULC dynamics. The trend of the basin's LULC was studied over two decades. The watershed was delineated into 17 sub-basins using SRTM digital elevation model. The delineation of the watershed and the extraction of the stream network were enabled by SAGA Strahler order plug-in. The model results showed that the basin's soil composition, associated with moderately high run-off, remains somewhat static during the 20-year study period. The soil types were distributed as follows: plinthic acrisols (42.4%), ferric acrisols (11.9%) and dystric nitosols (45.7%), with Ap15-1a-1068 being the most dominant and comprising 66% sand. All soil types in the study area belong to the hydrological soil group C. The LUCL of the basin (3027.4 km(2)) comprised of rangeland (2414.57 km(2)), built-up (57.46 km(2)), cropland (541.25 km(2)), forest (11.25 km(2)) and water (0.21 km(2)). Over the two decades of interest, the basin has undergone LULC changes of - 14.71%, 21.29%, 50.62%, 98% and 0.00% in rangeland, built-up area, cropland, forest and water body, respectively. The changes led to encroachment, alterations and diversification of LULC types of the sub-basins, resulting in changes in their surface characteristics and an increase in the number of hydrologic response units (HRUs) within the sub-basins from 74 in 2001 to 97 in 2019. Out of the 17 sub-basins, the HRU increased in 12, decreased in 2 and stayed the same in 3 sub-basins. Increase in the number of HRUs is significantly higher for HRUs smaller than 100 km(2). The major trend of LULC changes is the conversion of rangeland to residential area and agricultural land due to aggressive urbanization and rising need for food production to meet the demands of increasing population. Proper legislation should be put in place to ensure that the impact of urbanization and activities of herdsmen be contained and re-aligned with the sustainable development goals.",
1374,"Concentrations and characteristics of uranium isotopes in drinking waters collected in Italy and the Balkan regions and their radiological impact on the public The concentrations and characteristics of uranium isotopes in drinking waters of Italy and the Balkan regions were studied. The obtained mean uranium activity concentrations in drinking waters in Italy are 20.6 Â± 29.0 mBq l-1 for 238U, 25.3 Â± 35.6 mBq l-1 for 234U and 1.00 Â± 1.27 mBq l-1 for 235U. The mean activity ratios are 1.33 Â± 0.33 for 234U/238U and 0.047 Â± 0.038 for 235U/238U. The activity concentrations of uranium isotopes in waters of the Balkan regions are much lower than those in Italy. Depleted uranium has been detected in some water samples collected in the Balkan regions, but the measured concentrations do not constitute a health risk. The estimated average annual committed effective doses to the public due to water intake were 1.62 Î¼Sv yr-1 in Italy, 0.30 Î¼Sv yr-1 in Kosovo, 0.42 Î¼Sv yr-1 in Serbia and Montenegro, and 0.21 Î¼Sv yr-1 in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

1375,"Environmental reconstruction of Tuyoq in the Fifth Century and its bearing on Buddhism in Turpan, Xinjiang, China The Thousand Buddha Grottoes of Tuyoq, Turpan, Xinjiang, China were once a famous Buddhist temple along the ancient Silk Road which was first constructed in the Fifth Century (A.D.). Although archaeological researches about the Grottoes have been undertaken for over a century, the ancient environment has remained enigmatic. Based on seven clay samples from the Grottoes' adobes, pollen and leaf epidermis were analyzed to decipher the vegetation and climate of Fifth Century Turpan, and the environmental landscape was reconstructed in three dimensions. The results suggest that temperate steppe vegetation dominated the Tuyoq region under a warmer and wetter environment with more moderate seasonality than today, as the ancient mean annual temperature was 15.3Â°C, the mean annual precipitation was approximately 1000 mm and the temperature difference between coldest and warmest months was 24Â°C using Co-existence Approach. Taken in the context of wheat and grape cultivation as shown by pollen of Vitis and leaf epidermis of Triticum, we infer that the Tuyoq region was an oasis with booming Buddhism in the Fifth Century, which was probably encouraged by a 1Â°C warmer temperature with an abundant water supply compared to the coeval world that experienced the 1.4 k BP cooling event.",
1376,"C and 0 stable isotopes and rare earth elements in the Devonian carbonate host rock of the Pivehzhan iron deposit, NE Iran The Pivehzhan iron deposit is located at about 80km southwest of Mashhad, NE Iran. It occur within the Devonian carbonates as lenticular and massive bodies, as well as veinlets of magnetite and iron sulphides, transformed to goethite and haematite by weathering process. The hydrothermal calcite is the most important gangue mineral, which is observed in the form of veins/veinlets and open-space filling. The iron ores are accompanied by some minor elements such as Mn, Ti, Cr, and V and negligible amounts of Co and Ni. The distribution pattern of Rare Earth Elements (REEs) normalized to Post Archean Australian Shale (PAAS), which is characterized by the upward convex, as well as the positive Eu anomalies indicate the activity of reduced and acidic hydrothermal fluids. The negative Ce anomalies of host carbonates, although slight, point to the dominance of anoxic conditions during interaction with hydrothermal fluids. The hydrothermal calcite and quartz coexisting with the iron minerals contain principally fluid, which were homogenized into a liquid phase. The Homogenization Temperature (T-H) and the salinity of the analysed fluid inclusions range from 129 degrees C to 270 degrees C and from 0.4wt.% to 9.41wt.% NaCl eq., respectively. The delta C-13(PDB) and delta O-18(SMOW) values range from -2.15%0 to -5.77%0 (PeeDee Belemnite PDB standard) and from +19.87% 0 to +21.64%0 (Standard Mean Ocean Water SMOW standard) in hydrothermal calcite veinlets occurring with iron minerals, and from -0.66%0 to -4.37%0 (PDB) and from +15.55% 0 to +20.14%0 (SMOW) within the host carbonates, respectively. The field relations and petrographic examination along with geochemical and isotopic considerations indicate that the Pivehzhan iron deposit was formed through replacement processes by reducing and acid fluids containing light carbon and oxygen isotopes. Variations in the physico-chemical conditions of hydrothermal fluids and their interaction with carbonates were the most effective mechanisms in the formation of this iron deposit. The potential source of iron was probably the basement magmatic rocks from which iron was leached by hydrothermal solutions.",
1377,"Bottling Spring Water from a Serbian Mountain The aim of this study was to examine the possibilities of bottling the water from four sources (in total 10 springs) on Jastrebac Mountain in central Serbia. In the water samples, the following parameters were determined: Physico-chemical parameters - temperature and solids content (total, dissolved and suspended), turbidity, pH, conductivity, hardness (as CaCO3), alkalinity (as CaCO3), oxygen concentration and saturation, concentrations of Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, F-, Cl-, and SO42-, inorganic nitrogen content (NH4+, NO2-, and NO3-), total phosphorus and orthophosphates content (PO43-), and the content of organic compounds as concentrations of KMnO4 and UV extinction. Microbiological parameters - total count of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, count of coliform bacteria, and the presence of faecal indicators (faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, and sulphitereducing clostridia). Biological parameters. Based on the obtained values of the examined parameters and their ratings, five springs out of 10 tested could be considered for bottling. The values of the parameters of these springs were in compliance with current regulations for drinking water. Also, these springs had a significantly higher quality of water compared to the one of the most used bottled water in Serbia. Other springs had a considerably poorer quality of water due to exposure to the negative anthropogenic effects, which was particularly manifested in the form of the excessive count of total bacteria, the presence of the indicators of faecal contamination, and the presence of suspended solids.",1
1378,"Strontium isotopic signature of groundwater from Adamantina aquifer, Bauru Basin, Brazil Using Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and the geochemistry of groundwater we were able to identify different hydrochemical facies in the Adamantina aquifer, Bauru Basin (Brazil). Samples from shallow wells show Cl-NO3-Ca-Mg water with low pH due to natural and anthropogenic recharge. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios are greatest in the shallower parts of the aquifer (0.7134) and decrease with increasing well screen interval depth. The nitrate concentration gradually decreases with depth and aquifer pH increases, HCO3 predominates as the main anion, and the groundwater becomes saturated with respect to calcite, with average Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.708694 at depth.

1379,"[Effect of nitrogen removal simulated by RIP_ N model to a riparian zone in Guangting Reservoir catchment] An eco-hydrological model system (RIP_ N) was constructed to simulate the nitrogen (N) removal by riparian zone in reservoir catchment scale. As a case study, the N removal in Guanting Reservoir riparian zone from March to September in 2007 was estimated. At same time, the field simulated experiment was carried out in Yanqing experimental station, which lies in the northeast part of the catchment. With the experimental data and previous studies, the RIP_ N model was calibrated. RIP_ N model was consisted with two parts, which were soil chemical process modeling and plant growth modeling. Soil chemical processes considered the soil denitrification, nitrification and ammonium volatilization. Plant growth included net primary productivity (NPP) module, plant production allocation module and nutrition uptake module. The research indicated that the correlation coefficient between simulated value and monitored value was larger than 0.5, which proved the effectiveness and reliability of RIP_ N model in catchment scale simulating. The simulated results showed that the N removal loss by riparian zone in Guanting Reservoir catchment from March to September was 5.91 x 10(3) t. The model also identified the N removal functions of different land use. At present land use condition, the bottomland, forest land and grassland contributed positively environmental benefits and removed most of N. In the temporal scale, the N removal from March to September consisted 76.5% of annual removal load. On the contrary, the wetlands just removed 5.9% of N of whole watershed. By comparison, the riparian zone was recognized as critical location for non point source pollution prevention.",
1380,"The development of a water resource management infrastructure for the West Bank and Gaza The lack of any of the usual methods for water management within the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza leads to many, well documented problems. Realistic methods to move from the present situation to one of meaningful water management are not well documented. A recent visit, sponsored by the British Council, has allowed the opportunity to meet many people working within the water sector in the occupied territories, and some ideas on how to develop training programmes to improve water management capabilities have emerged. This paper outlines the perceived needs for scientific water management, and the components necessary for developing an indigenous management capability that can tackle the pressing water related problems of the region.

1381,"Role of the Atchafalaya River Basin in regulating export fluxes of dissolved organic carbon, nutrients, and trace elements to the Louisiana Shelf The abundance and fluxes of selected dissolved trace elements (TE), nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were quantified in the Atchafalaya River Basin to better understand its influence on the chemical regime of the Louisiana Shelf, a region where bottom water hypoxia occurs annually during late spring to early fall. Water samples were collected from throughout the entire Atchafalaya River Basin including from the Mississippi and Red Rivers as well as basin swamp waters during April and November 2010, and June 2011, which represent ""typical"" high and low, and ""unusual"" high river discharges, respectively. Within the total dissolved (<0.45 mu m) pool, most of the TEs were mainly partitioned to the <0.02 Jim dissolved phase with the exception of Cr, Cs, Fe, Pb and Zn which were dominantly in the colloidal (0.02-0.45 Jim) phase. In the Atchafalaya River, seasonal concentration variations in nutrients, DOC and most TEs were similar to those in the Mississippi River, reflecting a major contribution of water from the Mississippi River. Contributions of the Red River to the Atchafalaya River's DOC and nutrients were estimated to be 1-35%, similar to previous estimates for this system. The Red River contribution to the fluxes of Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Mn, Pb, Rb, and Zn was generally disproportionally high (>20%), exceeding its hydrological contribution (similar to 10%) to the Atchafalaya River, due to greatly enriched concentrations of these elements in the Red River. The Atchafalaya River Basin wetland/floodplain contribution to chemical constituents was noticeable, accounting for more than a 20% decrease of some elements (Cd, Cs, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, P, U, and Zn). Mn was the only element with persistent addition during all sampling campaigns. However, the contributions from the Red River were greater than the wetland/floodplain contributions for DOC, nutrients and most of TEs (except Mn), suggesting that the Red River plays a disproportionate role in regulating water quality in the Atchafalaya River. Overall, the Atchafalaya River with its chemical modification of Mississippi River water via contributions from the Red River and interactions with floodplain wetlands, plays a critical role in chemical distributions on the Louisiana Shelf in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Thus, the Atchafalaya River contribution should be adequately accounted for in biogeochemical studies and models of trace elements and nutrients on the Louisiana Shelf, particularly during periods of bottom water hypoxia.

1382,"Non-Carcinogenic Health Risk Assessment due to Fluoride Exposure from Tea Consumption in Iran Using Monte Carlo Simulation Excessive intake of fluoride can cause adverse health effects. Consumption of tea as a popular drink could be a potential source of fluoride exposure to humans. This research aimed to evaluate the fluoride concentration in tea among the Iranian people using the available data in the literature and to assess the health risk related to the consumption of tea in men, women, and children. The health risk assessment was conducted using the chronic daily intake and hazard quotient according to the approach suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency. The fluoride content in published studies varied noticeably, ranging from 0.13 to 3.27 mg/L. The results revealed that the hazard quotient (HQ) in age groups of women (21-72 years) and children (0-11 years) was within the safe zone (HQ < 1) which showed that there was no potential of non-carcinogenic risk associated with drinking tea in these groups. However, in one case of the men (21-72 years), the HQ > 1 which shows a probable risk of fluorosis. The order of non-carcinogenic health risks in the studied groups was in the order of men > women > children. The results of this can be useful for organizations with the responsibility of human health promotion.",
1383,"IMPACT OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY ON THE ENVIRONMENT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL NETWORKS Living in the era of social media where influencers dictate fashion trends things change faster than ever. Mainly in the field of clothing, fashion trends are changing almost every week and textile industry needs to follow them. In fact, the amount of clothes bought in the EU per person has increased by 40% in just a few decades and on the contrary, more than 30% of clothes in European wardrobes have not been used for at least a year. Firstly, textile industry pollutes the environment by producing clothes and secondly by throwing them away. Lots of clothes are thrown away and burned in incinerators or end up in a landfill where they release methane. Increasing clothing demand is driven by a decrease in prices and a strong growth of the impact of social networks. This trend is also known as fast fashion. Fast fashion relies on mass production in countries of the Third world, low prices, large volumes of sales and use of lower quality materials. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of new trend of clothing habits on the environment. Without a doubt, increased clothing production has a large environmental footprint due to the water, energy and chemicals used in washing, tumble drying and ironing, as well as because of plastics shed into the environment. Consequently, governments and organizations need to advocate promoting the use of ecological and sustainable raw materials and the re-use and recycling of clothing through all communication channels especially social media. Most of all, social media need to promote slow fashion as opposed to fast fashion and improve collection of textile for re-use, repair and recycling. In order to make sustainable decisions in the field of textile industry, the EU has adopted circular economy package by which it is required from each Member state to ensure that textile which is thrown away by people is collected separately.",
1384,"Effects of cumulus parameterization and land-surface hydrology schemes on Tibetan Plateau climate simulation during the wet season: insights from the RegCM4 model Dynamical downscaling generally performs poorly on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), due to the region's complex topography and several aspects of model physics, especially convection and land surface processes. This study investigated the effects of the cumulus parameterization scheme (CPS) and land-surface hydrology scheme (LSHS) on TP climate simulation during the wet season using the RegCM4 regional climate model. To address these issues and seek an optimal simulation, we conducted four experiments at a 20 km resolution using various combinations of two CPSs (Grell and MIT-Emanuel), two LSHSs (the default TOPMODEL [TOP], and Variable Infiltration Capacity [VIC]). The simulations in terms of 2-m air temperature, precipitation (including large-scale precipitation [LSP] and convective precipitation [CP]), surface energy-water balance, as well as atmospheric moisture flux transport and vertical motion were compared with surface and satellite-based observations as well as the ERA5 reanalysis dataset for the period 2006-2016. The results revealed that the model using the Grell and TOP schemes better reproduced air temperature but with a warm bias, part of which could be significantly decreased by the MIT scheme. All schemes simulated a reasonable spatial distribution of precipitation, with the best performance in the experiment using the MIT and VIC schemes. Excessive precipitation was produced by the Grell scheme, mainly due to overestimated LSP, while the MIT scheme largely reduced the overestimation, and the simulated contribution of CP to total precipitation was in close agreement with the ERA5 data. The RegCM4 model satisfactorily captured diurnal cycles of precipitation amount and frequency, although there remained some differences in phase and magnitude, which were mainly caused by the CPSs. Relative to the Grell scheme, the MIT scheme yielded a weaker surface heating by reducing net radiation fluxes and the Bowen ratio. Consequently, anomalous moisture flux transport was substantially reduced over the southeastern TP, leading to a decrease in precipitation. The VIC scheme could also help decrease the wet bias by reducing surface heating. Further analysis indicated that the high CP in the MIT simulations could be attributed to destabilization in the low and mid-troposphere, while the VIC scheme tended to inhibit shallow convection, thereby decreasing CP. This study's results also suggest that CPS interacts with LSHS to affect the simulated climate over the TP.",
1385,"Exploring changes in open defecation prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa based on national level indices Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that 215 million people continue to engage in open defecation. This practice facilitates the transmission of diarrheal diseases - one of the leading causes of mortality in children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa. The main purpose of this study is to: estimate changes in open defecation prevalence between 2005 and 2010 across countries in sub-Saharan Africa; examine the association between national level indices and changes in open defecation prevalence; and assess how many countries can achieve 'open defecation free status' by 2015. Methods: After applying selection criteria, this study analyzed country-level data for 34 sub-Saharan African countries. Seven country-level indices were collected: 1) presence of a national sanitation policy; 2) budget line for sanitation; 3) budget allocated to sanitation; 4) annual per capita GDP; 5) GDP growth; 6) implementation of total sanitation approaches; and 7) per capita aid disbursement for water supply and sanitation. The relationships between these country-level indices and the change in open defecation from 2005 to 2010 were investigated using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Spearman's rank correlation test. Results: Only 3 countries (i.e. Ethiopia, Angola and Sao Tome and Principe) decreased open defecation by 10% or more between 2005 and 2010. No significant associations were observed between the change in open defecation prevalence and all of national level indices except per capita aid disbursement. Per capita aid disbursement for water and sanitation was positively associated with a reduction in open defecation (p-value = 0.02) for a subset of 29 low-income countries from 2005 to 2010. Only one country in our analysis, Angola, is on track to end open defecation by 2015 based on their performance between 2000 and 2010. Conclusions: Most of the national level indices, including a country's economic status, were not associated with the change in the open defecation prevalence. Based on current trends, the goal of ending open defecation in the majority of sub-Saharan African countries by 2015 will not be achieved. Our findings may be limited by the exploratory nature of this analysis, and future research is required to identify and characterize national level factors specific to reducing open defecation in sub-Saharan Africa.",
1386,"Removal of Fluoride from drinking water by an activated Bentonite: application to a drinking Tunisian water Many regions in the South of Tunisia suffer from the existence of fluoride as considerable amounts (3 to 4.5 mg/L)in water resources. A Tunisian Bentonite was used for this aim. This natural and save absorbant was purified then activated. A Fe-Ben, was obtained, which shows a good potential as a cheap and efficient adsorbent for anionic micro pollutants removal from aqueous media. The modified bentonite was characterized by XRD and FTIR. The effect of pH, temperature, clay/fluoride ratio, equilibrium time and competitive ions on the adsorption of fluoride ions by batch process was studied. The obtained results revealed thata fluoride removal efficiency higher than 80%was obtained in the pH range 2-7. The equilibrium exhibits 40 min to be reached at room temperature. Kinetics data fitted pseudo-second-order model. Batch adsorption data was better described by Langmuir isotherm model than Freundlich isotherm model. The defloridation of a Tunisian drinking water containing considerable amounts of fluoride has shown prospective results at room temperature and in neutral pH.",
1387,"Effect of pre-aeration on the removal of arsenic and iron from natural groundwater in household based ceramic filters Maintenance of existing household arsenic (As) removal technologies are comparatively difficult due to the use of the sand beds as a filter. Moreover, pre-aeration of groundwater is avoided during filter operation that may affect the removal efficiency. This study investigated the effect of pre-aeration on the efficacy of simple iron nested ceramic filter (CF) for the removal of As and Fe from the natural groundwater. Five CFs at 5 households in the Bagerhat district of Bangladesh were tested for 31 days with pre-aerated groundwater (AGW system) and non-aerated groundwater (NAGW system). Pe-aeration of groundwater significantly improved (pÂ >Â 0.5) the removal efficiency of As and Fe in the CFs. The filters effectively removed As in the groundwater from 203 - 231Â Î¼g/L to 29-40Â Î¼g/L in the AGW system whereas the effluent As were >50Â Î¼g/L in the NAGW system. Iron (Fe) was also removed effectively and the overall As and Fe removal efficiency were more than 82% and 99%, respectively in the AGW system. Removal of Mn and PO(4)-P were significantly enhanced achieving more than 56% and 99% removal, respectively in the AGW system. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis indicated that the oxidation of Fe(2+) and As(III) and subsequent adoption/precipitation are the main processes controlling the removals of As and Fe in the CFs. Two stages oxidation of Fe(2+) and As(III) in the AGW system facilitated to increase As and Fe removal efficiency. The findings of this study suggest that the iron net nested ceramic filters with pre-aeration step is an effective method and can be employed at the household level in As contaminated region.",1
1388,"Climate change impact on yields and water use of wheat and maize in the North China Plain under future climate change scenarios Climate change has already and will continue to exert a vital impact on crop yield and water use in the North China Plain (NCP). Currently, this plain is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and grain production demand. It is urgent to identify the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption and then develop efficient adaptation strategies in the region. In this study, we used statistically downscaled daily climate data from 33 global climate models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 61 stations distributed across the NCP and drove the well-validated APSIM model to simulate crop yield and water use for two future periods of 2031-2060 (2040s) and 2071-2100 (2080s). Data from all 33 GCMs show an increase in annual mean temperature and almost all the GCMs also show increases in annual mean solar radiation and annual total precipitation across the NCP. Future climate warming led to an advance in phenology for both winter wheat and summer maize, two typical crops in the NCP. However, the length of the reproductive growth period (RGP) of winter wheat was prolonged while that of summer maize was shortened under future climate scenarios across the NCP. Our simulated results show that future climate change had negative impacts on maize yield but positive impacts on wheat yield across the NCP. Mainly due to the shortening of the whole growth period, crop water consumption was largely decreased under future climate scenarios. The amount of irrigation required was also reduced mainly due to increased precipitation and decreased ET. Although future climate change would likely mitigate groundwater overdraft in most part of NCP, some areas in the northern NCP still had groundwater over-pumping in the future. Therefore, we suggest that it might be a good choice to change cropping system for reducing planting area of water-consuming crop (e.g. winter wheat) in those over-pumping areas to balance groundwater use and crop yield.",
1389,"Selective removal of toxic anionic dyes using a novel nanocomposite derived from cationically modified guar gum and silica nanoparticles A novel nanocomposite derived from cationically modified guar gum and in-situ incorporated SiO2 NP (cat-GG/SiO2) has been developed. The cat-GG has been synthesised by grafting poly(2(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) on GG backbone. Various analyses endorse the suitability of cat-GG as well-organized template for the development of homogeneous SiO2 NPs. Dye adsorption studies predict that cat-GG/SiO2 efficiently and selectively adsorb anionic dyes (reactive blue-RB and Congo red-CR) from mixture of dye solutions. This is because of high surface area, multifunctional chelating H-bonding interactions and electrostatic interactions of cationic adsorbent with anionic dyes. Dyes adsorbed on the composite surface are desorbed reversibly using pH 10 stripping solution. Besides, cat-GG/SiO2 has been recycled efficiently with no prominent loss of dye uptake capacity, even after 4 adsorption-desorption cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1390,"Seasonal variation and factors influencing perchlorate in water, snow, soil and corns in Northeastern China Seasonal variation and influencing factors of perchlorate in snow, surface soil, rain, surface water, groundwater and corn were studied. Seven hundreds and seventy samples were collected in different periods in Harbin and its vicinity, China. Perchlorate concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry. Results indicate that fireworks and firecrackers display from the Spring Festival to the Lantern Festival (February 2, 2011-February 17, 2011) can result in the occurrence of perchlorate in surface soil and snow. Perchlorate distribution is affected by wind direction in winter. Melting snow which contained perchlorate can dissolve perchlorate in surface soil, and then perchlorate can percolate into groundwater so that perchlorate concentrations in groundwater increased in spring. Perchlorate concentrations in groundwater and surface water decrease after rainy season in summer. Groundwater samples collected in the floodplain areas of the Songhua River and the Ashi River contained higher perchlorate concentrations than that far away with the rivers. The corns have the ability to accumulate perchlorate.",
1391,"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DIARRHEA AMONG CHILDREN LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD IN SUDAN: A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF SUDAN MULTIPLE INDICATOR CLUSTER SURVEY 2014 Background: Diarrhea is the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or feces are discharged frequently from the bowl than the normal for the person). It is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children under the age of five in developing countries especially in the Sub-Sahara Africa including Sudan. The aim of the study was to explore the factors associated with diarrhea among children aged under 5 years in Sudan using the 2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). Methods: A total of 14081 children under 5 years who had completed the survey questionnaire were considered for this study. Data was entered and cleaned using SPSS version 17. Bivariate analysis was done using Pearson's Chi square test while multivariate analysis was done using binary logistic regression with 95% CI to examine the association between the dependent and independent variables. All variables with p-value <0.2 using the bivariate analysis was included in multivariate analysis. Results: The prevalence of diarrhea among children was 26.9% (3785 children with diarrhea out of 14081). Factors associated with diarrhea were weight for height z-score, weight for age z-score, wealth index quintile and child age in months. In multivariate analysis, children from the fourth wealth index quintile were 1.21 times more likely to develop diarrhea, (OR: 1.21, p=0.016) than those children from the richest wealth index quintile. Children who were severely underweighted were 1.59 times more likely to develop diarrhea (OR: 1.59, p<0.001) than children who were normal. The risk of diarrhea was 32% lower in severely wasted children (OR: 0.68, p=0.047) than those children who were obese. Children aged 6-11 and 12-23 months were about 2.5 times more at risk of getting diarrhea (OR: 2.49, p<0.001; OR: 2.45, p<0.001 respectively) in comparison to children aged 48-59 months. Conclusions: Nutritional factors were found to be associated with diarrhea. Continuous governmental efforts to eradicate malnutrition and hunger are recommended. The MICS 2014 of Sudan has produced much of great value; but there are some questions about certain kinds of information. Unexpected results were found regarding main source, treatment of drinking water and toilet facilities. Further studies in the form of longitudinal studies are needed as one cannot infer causality using this kind of study.",
1392,"Identification of priority organic compounds in groundwater recharge of China Groundwater recharge using reclaimed water is considered a promising method to alleviate groundwater depletion, especially in arid areas. Traditional water treatment systems are inefficient to remove all the types of contaminants that would pose risks to groundwater, so it is crucial to establish a priority list of organic compounds (OCs) that deserve the preferential treatment. In this study, a comprehensive ranking system was developed to determine the list and then applied to China. 151 OCs, for which occurrence data in the wastewater treatment plants were available, were selected as candidate OCs. Based on their occurrence, exposure potential and ecological effects, two different rankings of OCs were established respectively for groundwater recharge by surface infiltration and direct aquifer injection. Thirty-four OCs were regarded as having no risks while the remaining 117 OCs were divided into three groups: high, moderate and low priority OCs. Regardless of the recharge way, nonylphenol, erythromycin and ibuprofen were the highest priority OCs; their removal should be prioritized. Also the database should be updated as detecting technology is developed.",
1393,"Denitrification and associated nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions from the Amazonian wetlands In this paper, we quantify the CO2 and N2O emissions from denitrification over the Amazonian wetlands. The study concerns the entire Amazonian wetland ecosystem with a specific focus on three floodplain (FP) locations: the Branco FP, the Madeira FP and the FP alongside the Amazon River. We adapted a simple denitrification model to the case of tropical wetlands and forced it by open water surface extent products from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. A priori model parameters were provided by in situ observations and gauging stations from the HYBAM Observatory. Our results show that the denitrification and the trace gas emissions present a strong cyclic pattern linked to the inundation processes that can be divided into three distinct phases: activation, stabilization and deactivation. We quantify the average yearly denitrification and associated emissions of CO2 and N2O over the entire watershed at 17.8 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) , 0.37 gC-CO2 M(-2 )yr(-1) and 0.18 gN-N2O M-2 yr(-1) respectively for the period 2011-2015. When compared to local observations, it was found that the CO(2)emissions accounted for 0.01 % of the integrated ecosystem, which emphasizes the fact that minor changes to the land cover may induce strong impacts on the Amazonian carbon budget. Our results are consistent with the state of the art of global nitrogen models with a positive bias of 28 %.When compared to other wetlands in different pedoclimatic environments we found that the Amazonian wetlands have similar emissions of N2O with the Congo tropical wetlands and lower emissions than the temperate and tropical anthropogenic wetlands of the Garonne (France), the Rhine (Europe) and south-eastern Asia rice paddies. In summary our paper shows that a data-model-based approach can be successfully applied to quantify N2O and CO(2)fluxes associated with denitrification over the Amazon basin. In the future, the use of higher-resolution remote sensing products from sensor fusion or new sensors like the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will permit the transposition of the approach to other large-scale watersheds in tropical environments.",
1394,"The Fate of Ammonium-nitrogen in Leachate Contaminated Groundwater System Hydrogeochemical conditions influences strongly on ammonium attenuation and ultimately its long-term fate in the subsurface. The purpose of this work was to identify the conditions influencing the persistence of ammonium-nitrogen in the contaminated groundwater system of Taman Beringin ex-landfill site in Malaysia. This study applies hydrogeochemical data extractions techniques of redox sensitive groundwater species from previously installed monitoring wells between February to August 2014. Electrochemical measurements of Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) were collected successively with several other physicochemical parameters including pH, Temperature, and DO in the landfill site. The result show that the mean concentration of NH4-N, NO2-N, and NO3-N are: (47.98 +/- 81.83 mg/L), (0.17 +/- 0.22 mg/L) and (6.11 +/- 8.74 mg/L) respectively. The mean range of redox potentials (-10.25 +/- 128.28 mV) delineated areas of strongly reducing conditions. Based on the evaluation of the data, NH4-N, NO2-N and NO3-N accounts for 89.98%, 0.28% and 9.7% respectively of the groundwater concentration of total nitrogen, while a miniature proportion of oxidisable nitrogen concentrations (10.02%) are attributed to biological process of nitrification. Relationship exist between data set NH4-N and ORP (r = -0.65009). It was concluded that although biological attenuation processes are effectively decreasing the ammonia concentrations in some of the wells, the processes are inhibited by chemical conditions that were attributed to Fe reducing conditions as observed in some of the wells. NH4-N will remain persistent and at elevated levels as much as the conditions persist and contributes in determining the fate of NH4-N in the Taman Beringin ground water system.",
1395,"Impact of economic activity on geoecological transformation of the basin of the Zhovtenka River (Ukraine) The article presents the results of the study on the current geoecological condition of the basin of the Zhovtenka River. The study object corresponded to the criteria of a small river, having the length of 42 km and the area of the drainage basin of 293 km(2). According to the geographic peculiarities and the level of anthropogenic impact it is a typical small river of the Ukrainian Steppe zone. At the current stage of water management, the river and its tributaries are significantly regulated by artificial aquatic objects - ponds and a water reservoir. The total number of hydrotechnical facilities that form the water bodies is 34 levees. On the river itself, average density of water bodies equals 1 pond per every 2 km of the river length. Such regulation contradicts the norms of the current water protection legislation of Ukraine. As a result of fragmentation, the river has turned into a cascade of evaporation ponds. Special ecological threat to water use is the quality of water in the ponds. We determined that due to absence of current and low water exchange, the saline content in water undergoes significant changes. During the field surveys, we collected samples and determined the parameters of mineralization, content of chlorides and sulfates in 10 water bodies. Sampling was carried out during the year in different seasons. We determined that the averaged parameters of mineralization level change within the range of 9.000 mg/dm(3) in spring to 13.000 mg/dm(3) in summer and autumn. The content of chlorides varies within 2.600-3.600 mg/dm(3), sulfates - 4.000-4.800 mg/dm(3) according to the similar seasonal dependence. Due to changes in the climatic conditions and current tendencies of warming and dry climate, decrease in the water resources heightens the risks of irreversible geoecological degradation of the river. Significant regulation and evaporation-caused loss of water leads to rapid shoaling of the water bodies and growth of aquatic-marsh vegetation. The authors suggest an approach to assessment of the level of geoecological transformation of the river basin based on determining quantitative parameters of the constituents of the elements of natural ecosystems and elements of negative anthropogenic impact. We proposed calculation of various coefficients (indicators) which alter the natural condition of water ecosystems, particularly: coefficients of fragmentation, coefficients of urbanization, coefficients of alienation, etc. We present a possibility of using them in relation to the length of the river and hydrographic network, as well as the area of drainage. We determined that percentage parameter of geoecological impact was seen in 94.3% of the area of the drainage basin or 87.4% of the river length. We suggest approaches that would minimize the deleterious impact of economic activity and gradually restore the condition of aquatic ecosystem of the river. The article provides recommendations of using coefficients of geoecological transformation of river ecosystems.",
1396,"Mass balance of a maritime glacier on the southeast Tibetan Plateau and its climatic sensitivity Based on glaciometeorological measurements and mass balance stake records during the 5year period of 2005-2010 on the southeast Tibetan Plateau, an energy-mass balance model was applied to study the surface mass balance of the Parlung No. 94 Glacier, as well as its response to regional climate conditions. The primary physical parameters involved in the model were locally calibrated by using relevant glaciometeorological data sets. The good agreement between the snowpack height/mass balance simulations and the in situ measurements available from a total of 12 monitoring stakes over this glacier confirmed the satisfactory performance of the energy-mass balance model. Results suggested that the recent state of the Parlung No. 94 Glacier was far removed from the ideal climatic regime leading to zero mass balance, with its annual mass balance of approximately -0.9m water equivalent during 2005-2010. Climatic sensitivity experiments were also carried out to interpret the observed mass balance changes, and the experiments demonstrated that the maritime glaciers concerned herein were theoretically more vulnerable to ongoing climate warming on the Tibetan Plateau than potential changes in the amount of precipitation. A plausible causal explanation for the recent glacier shrinkage in this region was concerned with the increasing air temperature. Moreover, both the mass balance simulations and the field measurements indicated that the mass accumulation over this maritime glacier occurred primarily in the boreal spring. Such spring-accumulation type glaciers are presumed to be distributed mainly within a narrow wedge-shaped region along the Brahmaputra River. Climatic sensitivities of the glacier mass balance are also found to be closely linked to the regional precipitation seasonality that is simultaneously modulated by various atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the southern westerlies, the Bay of Bengal vortex in the spring season, and the Indian monsoon in the summer season.",
1397,"Multiple mechanisms of coseismic water level changes at the Rongchang well in a seismically active area in China We examined water level data at the Rongchang (RC) well in the Rongchang natural gas field in China's Sichuan Basin from November 2007 through 2019, where injection-induced seismicity with a magnitude of up to 5.2 has been reported. Coseismic water level changes caused by earthquakes from 3 km to 3500 km away, as well as changes in water temperature, provide a good opportunity to systematically study the mechanisms underlying the response of water level to earthquakes. Among 41 M-L >= 3.0 local earthquakes, 20 events exceeded the magnitude-distance threshold for the water level to change. Eleven events caused water levels to rise, and only one earthquake led to a decrease in water level. For the 22 distant earthquakes with a seismic energy density greater than the threshold of 0.0017 J/m(3), ten events caused rises in the water level and only the M-w 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake caused a temporary, but large, decrease in water level. In total, eight local events and 11 distant events, which were expected to cause coseismic water level changes, actually resulted in no changes. The findings imply that an earlier sizable earthquake may decrease the sensitivity of the well for a certain period of time (approximately two months). The dominant mechanisms of coseismic water level changes in response to near-, mid-, and far-field earthquakes are different. For near-field earthquakes, the drop in coseismic water level is governed by the combined effects of static strain changes and the release of trapped gas bubbles due to the strong vibration of seismic waves in the aquifer; however, only static strain changes are dominant after mid-field earthquakes. For far-field earthquakes, the dominant mechanism is aquifer softening due to growth of gas bubbles in the groundwater that is associated with weak and low frequency seismic shaking of passing surface waves.",
1398,"Hydrochemistry and coal mining activity induced karst water quality degradation in the Niangziguan karst water system, China Hydrogeochemical analysis, statistical analysis, and geochemical modeling were employed to evaluate the impacts of coal mining activities on karst water chemistry in Niangziguan spring catchment, one of the largest karst springs in Northern China. Significant water quality deterioration was observed along the flow path, evidenced from the increasing sulfate, nitrate, and TDS content in karst water. Karst water samples are Ca-Mg-HCO3 type in the recharge areas, Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4 type in the coal mining areas, and Ca-Mg-SO4-HCO3/HCO3-SO4 type in the rural areas and discharge areas. A four-factor principal component analysis (PCA) model is conducted which explains over 82.9% of the total variation. Factor 1, which explained the largest portion (45.33%) of the total variance, reveals that coal mining activities and natural water-rock interaction as the primary factors controlling karst water quality. Anthropogenic effects were recognized as the secondary factor with high positive loadings for NO3 (-) and Cl(-) in the model. The other two factors are co-precipitation removal of trace elements and silicate mineral dissolution, which explained 20.96% of the total variance. A two-end mixing modeling was proposed to estimate the percentage of coal wastewater giving on karst water chemistry, based on the groundwater sulfate chemistry constrains rather than sulfur isotopes. Uncertainty of sulfur isotope sources led to an overestimation of coal mining water contribution. According to the results of the modeling, the contribution of coal mining waste on karst water chemistry was quantified to be from 27.05 to 1.11% which is ca. three times lower than the values suggested using a sulfur isotope method.",
1399,"Effects of disinfectant and biofilm on the corrosion of cast iron pipes in a reclaimed water distribution system The effects of disinfection and biofilm on the corrosion of cast iron pipe in a model reclaimed water distribution system were studied using annular reactors (ARs). The corrosion scales formed under different conditions were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the bacterial characteristics of biofilm on the surface were determined using several molecular methods. The corrosion scales from the ARs with chlorine included predominantly Î±-FeOOH and Fe2O3, while CaPO3(OH)Â·2H2O and Î±-FeOOH were the predominant phases after chloramines replaced chlorine. Studies of the consumption of chlorine and iron release indicated that the formation of dense oxide layers and biofilm inhibited iron corrosion, causing stable lower chlorine decay. It was verified that iron-oxidizing bacteria (IOB) such as Sediminibacterium sp., and iron-reducing bacteria (IRB) such as Shewanella sp., synergistically interacted with the corrosion product to prevent further corrosion. For the ARs without disinfection, Î±-FeOOH was the predominant phase at the primary stage, while CaCO3 and Î±-FeOOH were predominant with increasing time. The mixed corrosion-inducing bacteria, including the IRB Shewanella sp., the IOB Sediminibacterium sp., and the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) Limnobacter thioxidans strain, promoted iron corrosion by synergistic interactions in the primary period, while anaerobic IRB became the predominant corrosion bacteria, preventing further corrosion via the formation of protective layers.",
1400,"Pollution and Sanitation Problems as Setbacks to Sustainable Water Resources Management in Freetown The civil conflict in Sierra Leone (1991-2001) caused a dramatic increase in the population of Freetown. This population increase overstretched housing facilities, leading to the creation of camps and many squatter settlements with poor sanitation practices. Overcrowding has become a serious concern in light of the acute water shortage that struck Freetown in May and June 2006. Some of the numerous small water bodies that could have been used to augment the public water supply were contaminated by the disposal of solid and industrial waste and poor sewage management. Improper disposal practices have a direct impact on public health. This paper recommends addressing the policy gap, establishing clear threshold criteria for all water bodies and wastewater discharge, and integrating the above issues in the ongoing review process of draft water sanitation policy. Public education of the negative consequences of poor waste management practices on water quality and public health can also positively affect general sanitation practices",
1401,"The Water Environment Carrying Capacity of the Aiyi River Based on Artificial Neural Networks To understand the characteristics of the water's environmental carrying capacity in the Aiyi River in Yinchuan, Ninxia, China, a BP artificial neural network analysis based on water environmental factors and aquatic biodiversity metrics were conducted. Twelve indicators were used to construct an evaluation index system to examine the water environment carrying capacity of the river, namely ratio of water supply and water requirements; ratios of water environmental capacity to pollutant emissions of COD Mn, BOD5, TN, NH3-N, and TP; self-purification rate; biodiversity indices of phytoplankton, zooplankton zoobenthos, and aquatic macrophytes; and a comprehensive nutrition state index. A model of water environmental carrying capacity was constructed according to the BP artificial neural network. The model, which quantitatively analyzed the water environmental carrying capacity of the Aiyi River, found it to be in the basic carrying state.",
1402,"A geological investigation of the Waterberg hydrothermal platinum deposit, Mookgophong, Limpopo Province, South Africa The geology around the unusual quartz-vein hosted Waterberg platinum deposit was mapped using aerial photographs at a scale of 1: 1000 to establish possible controls on this unique style of mineralisation. The study area is located in the Mookgophong (Naboomspruit) District of the Limpopo Province in South Africa and is dominated by a gently to moderately, NNW-dipping irregular sequence of bimodal (rhyolite-basalt) volcanics, interbedded with many sedimentary rocks, that form part of the extensive 2.06 Ga Rooiberg Group, that are cut by variably striking, steep to subvertical quartz veins. The regional geology of the area was mapped at various scales in the 1920s and 1940s, but much of this work remains inaccessible and mapping during this study has uncovered more detail. The major platiniferous quartz vein (known as the 'Main Lode') juxtaposes volcanic rocks of Rooiberg age against Triassic sandstones and therefore occupies a fault. There is no textural evidence that quartz veining was syntectonic and may be much younger. The well-exposed vein fabrics show many features typical of low pressure epithermal quartz veins and probably formed near the present-day surface beneath a highly eroded Karoo cover, suggesting a recent age for veining and Pt mineralisation. The Main Lode can be followed for at least 3 km along strike, but Pt mineralisation is concentrated in a short section of the vein around 500 m in length. A major regional fault (the Welgevonden Fault) occurs about 2 km to the northwest of, and parallel to, the Main Lode. The Welgevonden Fault zone is suggested to extend to the northeast and merge with the Planknek-Ysterberg Fault system, south of Mokopane (Potgietersrus). The Welgevonden Fault is presently geothermally active, but this fluid system does not carry significant concentrations of Pt and may represent a younger Pt-depleted stage of hydrothermal activity related to the event that formed the Main Lode. It is unlikely that the Rooiberg volcanics and younger rocks supplied the platinum-group elements in the deposit and the source for these metals must lie elsewhere. It is suggested that shearing along the Welgevonden-Plankneck Fault system transposed PGE-bearing mafic rocks of the northern Bushveld Complex to a position at unknown depth beneath the Waterberg deposit, or provided a network of shear zones which could be exploited by a recent hydrothermal event that transported platinum and other metals westwards along the fault system and redeposited them near the surface.

1403,"Continuous monitoring of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in a hot spring: Significance for distant earthquakes Earthquakes can change the physical and chemical properties of groundwater, and the changes can be identified by isotope techniques. Here, the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of groundwater from the Banglazhang #1 hot spring in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, were collected from April 2015 to March 2019. The results show that the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen are distributed around the local meteoric water line (LMWL), indicating that the hot spring recharge source is meteoric water with slight water-rock interaction. Temporal variations in the isotope ratios show that the recharge sources are relatively stable and the groundwater residence time is relatively long. However, in two periods, values exceed the background ratios recharged from meteoric water and are associated with distant earthquakes with magnitudes 6.8, 4.6 and 4.4. The stable isotope ratios changed within three months before the earthquakes due to permeability decreases in aquifers associated with stress and strain increases before the earthquakes. The changing permeability led to reduced recharge by deep hot water and the isotopes shift. These results reveal that the continuous observation of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes can indicate the recharge characteristics of groundwater and reflect the regional stress and strain before distant earthquakes. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes may provide information for the analysis of earthquake precursors.",
1404,"Physicochemical and microbiological assessment of spring water in central Himalayan region In the present study, water quality of 16 springs, located along National Highway-58 from Rishikesh to Badrinath in India, was assessed by determining various physicochemical and microbiological parameters in three different seasons, i.e., pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon. For majority of the springs, the pH was slightly alkaline with temperature ranging between 10 and 27Â Â°C. All other parameters such as total hardness (TH), total alkalinity (TA), chloride, phosphate, nitrate, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were found to lie within the acceptable limit prescribed by various standard national and international agencies. The principal component analysis reveals that water quality of springs mainly depends on mineral contents of water, as there is a loading of TH, TA, EC, TDS, and other mineral components during one or other season of a year. The positive correlation coefficients determined among mineral components of spring water further substantiate this fact. No loading of DO, BOD, nitrate, and phosphate indicates an absence of anthropogenic pollution in the studied area. No trace metals were detected in any of the springs. Most probable number (MPN) index for coliforms was found to be above the acceptable limit for all the springs in one or more seasons of a year, except the one in Pandukeshwar. Plate-based assay revealed the presence of pathogens like Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas in some spring water. The findings of the present work reveal that due to high MPN index and presence of other pathogenic bacteria, water from most of the springs cannot be considered completely safe for direct human consumption in its raw form.",1
1405,"Estimating chemical biotransformation rates from food web concentrations Biotransformation is widely recognized as the most important and most uncertain determinant of bioaccumulation. A step-wise method for estimating organism-specific biotransformation half-lives from field observations and using established food web modeling is developed. As a proof of concept, the method is applied to the case of nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a well-studied food web in Bohai Bay, China. The estimated half-lives are in good agreement with the existing literature. The proposed biotransformation estimation method, through data mining, for sufficiently defined ecosystems, may greatly reduce the necessary animal testing involved in chemical assessments by providing useful guidance to experimentalists and regulators.",
1406,"U and Th in some brown coals of Serbia and Montenegro and their environmental impact GOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: The objective of this paper is to determine and compare the concentrations of U and Th in soft to hard brown (lignite to sub-bituminous) coals of Serbia and Montenegro. It also presents comparison of the obtained data on U and Th concentrations with the published data on coals located in some other countries of the world. Almost the whole coal production of Serbia and Montenegro is used as feed coals for combustion in thermal power plants. METHODS: Channel samples from open pit and underground mines and core samples were collected for hard and soft brown coals. For the analysis the samples were decomposed using microwave technique. Obtained solutions containing U and Th were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) using NIST standards. RESULTS: Concentration of U from the investigated basins and the corresponding mine fields ranges within 0.60-70.10 mg/kg, 0.65-3.20 mg/kg, 0.95-6.59 mg/kg, 1.20-6.05 mg/kg, 0.80-6.66 mg/kg, 0.18-89.90 mg/kg, 0.19-4.14 mg/kg, and 0.28-3.52 mg/kg for the Kostolac, Kolubara, Krepoljin, Sjenica, Soko Banja, Bogovina East field, Senje-Resavica and Pljevlja basins, respectively. Concentration of Th ranges within 0.20-2.60 mg/kg, 0.84-6.57 mg/kg, 1.48-6.48 mg/kg, 0.12-2.71 mg/kg, 0.13-4.95 mg/kg, 0.14-3.48 mg/kg, 0.29-3.56 mg/kg, and 0.17-1.89 mg/kg for the Kostolac, Kolubara, Krepoljin, Sjenica, Soko Banja, Bogovina East field, Senje-Resavica and Pljevlja basins, respectively. DISCUSSION: Brown coal from Senje-Resavica, Kolubara, Kostolac and Pljevlja is characterized by low U concentration. Coals form the Krepoljin, Soko Banja and Sjenica basins have slightly higher U concentrations than the mentioned group. The highest concentration of U is characteristic for the coal from the Bogovina East field. Concentration of Th in coals from Serbia and Montenegro has proved to be low. Out of all investigated coal basins, only the coal from the Krepoljin and Kolubara basins has high concentration of Th. The hydrothermally altered rocks of the Timok dacite-andesite complex, representing the basement of the Bogovina basin, could be a potential source of U, especially at the bottom part of the Lower seam of the Bogovina East field. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that brown coals in Serbia and Montenegro (soft to hard brown coals or lignite to sub-bituminous) contain low levels of U (5.30 mg/kg, average value and 2.10 mg/kg geometric mean value) and Th (1.80 mg/kg, average value and 1.12 mg/kg geometric mean value). There are some obvious differences in concentration of U and Th in coals from different basins in Serbia and Montenegro. The approximate value for U and Th release mainly from power plants was 644.33 t and 983.46 t, respectively within the period 1965-2000 for the studied mines in Serbia, and 23.76 t and 15.05 t for the Potrlica mine (Montenegro) within the period 1965-1997. RECOMMENDATIONS: The coals in Serbia and Montenegro show no identifiable unfavourable impact on the surrounding environment, due to low natural radioactive concentration of U and Th, but further investigations concerning human health should be performed. PERSPECTIVES: Preliminary research revealed that in some Serbian coals (and, particularly, parts of the coal seam) U and Th content are rather high. Such coals should be carefully studied, as well as U and Th concentrations in ash, fly ash, waste disposals, nearby soil and ground water. Further studies should include determination of the radioactivity of all these products, and estimation of possible health impact.",
1407,"Evaluation of the surface water quality in the Kebir-Rhumel catchment area (northeast Algeria) using biotic indices and physico-chemical analyses Assessing the water quality of the Kebir-Rhumel watershed by the use of benthic macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical analysis is the aim of this work. Thirteen physicochemical parameters and macroinvertebrates fauna were collected monthly in 15 stations located along the catchment area in the two principal wadis: El Kebir and Rhumel. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to study the relationships between physico-chemical parameters and macroinvertebrates. Biotic indices Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP'), Global Biological Normalized Index (IBGN), EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera), and %EPT/Chironomidae, based on benthic macroinvertebrates, have been applied in assessing the biological water quality. According to the results, a majority of the physicochemical parameters measured during the study period show spatial heterogeneity (Kruskal-Wallis, P value < 0.05), indicating that Rhumel wadi is more polluted compared with El Kebir wadi; the NO(2)(-), NO(3)(-), PO(4)(-3), Cl(-), and SM contents are very high consequences of human and industrial anthropogenic actions. Canonical correspondence analysis has shown that the environmental parameters measured during this study influence the dynamics of macroinvertebrates, and the polluo-resistant taxa (Chironomidae) predominate in sites very rich in organic matter with low oxygen conditions. Sensitive taxa have a vulnerability to pollution. The biotic indices used confirm the diagnosis of the physicochemical analysis demonstrating a very degraded quality at Rhumel wadi. The EPT index and %EPT/Chironomidae results are closer to the scores of the BMWP' index.",
1408,"Appraisal of Groundwater Quality with Human Health Risk Assessment in Parts of Indo-Gangetic Alluvial Plain, North India Groundwater contamination in the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain has reportedly been affected by various factors, such as mineral dissolution, overexploitation, precipitation, and ion exchange. This study was designed to interpret the hydrochemical fluctuations in the groundwater sources of a rural area in Raebareli district. Groundwater is slightly alkaline and affected by the issues of fluoride, salinity, hardness, and nitrate. The Pollution Index of Groundwater significantly categorize 57% and 79% of the samples under the ""insignificant pollution"" category during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. The Health risk assessment indicated the high susceptibility of children toward health risks. It also indicated that fluoride had greater impact than nitrate in the study area. The multivariate statistical analysis indicates that anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural practices, including excessive fertilizer application and improper domestic and cattle waste management, are probable causes of groundwater contamination through NO(3)(-), Cl(-), Na(+), and K(+). Furthermore, the base exchange index classified 71.43% samples in pre-monsoon and 78.57% in post-monsoon as Na-HCO(3) type. The meteoric genesis index suggested that 78.57% and 85.71% of the samples belong to shallow meteoric water percolation type during pre- and post-monsoon periods, respectively. The Piper plots revealed that HCO(3)-CaÂ·Mg and SO(4)Â·Cl-Naâ€‰+â€‰K type are the prominent facies in the area, with dominance of alkalis and weak acids. According to Gibbs plot, majority of the samples fall under ""rock dominance"" suggesting that ""rock-water"" interaction was the dominant natural process controlling the groundwater chemistry.",
1409,"Palaeocarpinus aspinosa sp nov (Betulaceae) from the Paleocene of Wyoming, USA A new species of Palaeocarpinus Crane (Betulaceae) is recognized from the Paleocene of southwestern Wyoming that extends the concept of the genus to include fruits with nonspiny bracts. Fruits of P. aspinosa sp, nov. are borne in pairs on an elongate infructescence, each fruit enclosed by two equal bracts that are entire-margined to serrate but not dissected or spiny. Associated staminate catkins contain well-preserved pollen that is not only triporate, but commonly tetra- to pentaporate. The pollen exine is teclate-granular, with spinulate ornamentation. Co-occurring betulaceous leaves are similar to those of P. joffrensis Sun el Stockey from Canada and P. orientalis from China and to leaves of extant Corylus. The associated infructescences, leaves, and staminate inflorescences with in situ pollen facilitate detailed reconstruction of this extinct species and provide a clearer understanding of the genus and its relation to extant genera. Palaeocarpinus aspinosa, with its nonspiny fruit bracts and multiporate pollen, adds to our understanding of the morphological diversity present in this widespread early Tertiary genus. The nondissected bracts may have been effective for wind and water dispersal whereas other species with spiny burrlike bracts may have been dispersed by furry animals.",

1411,"A simple evaluation of soil quality of waterlogged purple paddy soils with different productivities Evaluation of soil quality can be crucial for designing efficient farming systems and ensuring sustainable agriculture. The present study aimed at evaluating the quality of waterlogged purple paddy soils with different productivities in Sichuan Basin. The approach involved comprehensive analyses of soil physical and chemical properties, as well as enzyme activities and microbial community structure measured by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA). A total of 36 soil samples were collected from four typical locations, with 12 samples representing high productivity purple paddy soil (HPPS), medium productivity purple paddy soil (MPPS) and low productivity purple paddy soil (LPPS), respectively. Most measured soil properties showed significant differences (P â‰¤ 0.05) among HPPS, MPPS and LPPS. Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis were used to identify appropriate soil quality indicators. A minimum data set (MDS) including total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), acid phosphatase (ACP), total bacteria (TB) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was established and accounted for 82.1% of the quality variation among soils. A soil quality index (SQI) was developed based on the MDS method, whilst HPPS, MPPS and LPPS received mean SQI scores of 0.725, 0.536 and 0.425, respectively, with a ranking of HPPS > MPPS > LPPS. HPPS showed relatively good soil quality characterized by optimal nutrient availability, enzymatic and microbial activities, but the opposite was true of LPPS. Low levels of TN, AP and soil microbial activities were considered to be the major constraints limiting the productivity in LPPS. All soil samples collected were rich in available N, K, Si and Zn, but deficient in available P, which may be the major constraint for the studied regions. Managers in our study area should employ more appropriate management in the LPPS to improve its rice productivity, and particularly to any potential limiting factor.",
1412,"Biotoxicity of water-soluble species in PM2.5 using Chlorella China has been faced with severe haze pollution, which is hazardous to human health. Among the air pollutants, PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) is the most dangerous because of its toxicity and impact on human health and ecosystems. However, there has been limited research on PM2.5 particle toxicity. In the present study, we collected daily PM2.5 samples from January 1 to March 31, 2018 and selected samples to extract water-soluble species, including SO42-, NO3-, WSOC, and NH4+. These samples represented clean, good, slight, moderate, and heavy pollution days. After extraction using an ultrasonic method, PM2.5 solutions were obtained. We used Chlorella as the test algae and studied the content of chlorophyll a, as well as the variation in fluorescence when they were placed into the PM2.5 extraction solution, and their submicroscopic structure was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that when the air quality was relatively clean and good (PM2.5 concentration <= 75 mu g m(-3)), the PM2.5 extraction solutions had no inhibiting effects on Chlorella, whereas when the air quality was polluted (PM2.5 concentration > 75 mu g m(-3)) and heavily polluted (PM(2. )concentration > 150 mu gm(-3)), with increasing PM2.5 concentrations and exposure time, the chlorophyll a content in Chlorella decreased. Moreover, the maximum photochemical quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of Chlorella obviously decreased, indicating chlorophyll inhibition during polluted days with increasing PM2.5 concentrations. The effects on the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were also obvious, leading to an increase of energy dissipated per unit reaction center (DIo/RC), suggesting that Chlorella could survive when exposed to PM2.5 solutions, whereas the physiological activities were significantly inhibited. The TEM analysis showed that there were few effects on Chlorella cell microstructure during clean days, whereas plasmolysis occurred during light- and medium-polluted days. With increasing pollution levels, plasmolysis became more and more apparent, until the organelles inside the cells were thoroughly destroyed and most of the parts could not be recognized.

1413,"NEGOTIATING WATER ON UNEQUAL TERMS: CATTLE LOANS, DEPENDENCIES AND POWER IN COMMUNAL WATER MANAGEMENT IN NORTHWEST NAMIBIA This article shows how the distribution of costs for communal boreholes in the Kunene region of northwest Namibia is largely shaped by patron-client relationships based on cattle loans among pastoralists. Drawing on a case study in the context of state water decentralisation reforms, the paper argues that, while cattle loans provide livelihood security for poor Himba herders, they also limit their bargaining power with regards to negotiating local contribution rules for the communal water point. Poorer heads of household find it difficult to negotiate on equal terms with their wealthy counterparts because they depend on their cattle transfers to make a living. As a result, contribution rules disadvantaging the poor are put into practice, leading to tensions between herders and putting pressure on social relations of support.",
1414,"Optimization of movable irrigation system and performance assessment of distribution uniformity under varying conditions The evaluation of the performance of distribution uniformity by linearly moved irrigation system (LMIS) should consider the impacts of non uniformity of the water on crop yield. With increasing pressures to improve water use efficiency, plant productivity and farm profitability, questions continue to be raised concerning the future direction of irrigated agriculture. This study therefore aimed at evaluating water distribution under LMIS newly designed by the National Research Centre of Fluid Machinery Engineering and Technology, Jiangsu University, China. This article reports the real distribution of irrigation water under the LMIS with respect to sprinkler height above the ground surface as well as the consequence of different operating pressures. Water distribution coefficients used in the performance assessment were Christiansen's coefficient of uniformity (CU), distribution uniformity (DU), scheduling coefficients (Sc) and the coefficient of variation (CV). The results showed that the mean CU ranged from 82.30% to 93.17%, and mean DU ranged from 70.39% to 88.44%. Also Sc values ranged from 1.13 to 1.42 with CV values ranging from 10.3% to 22.5%. The optimum method and results in this study can provide a reference to the operations for saving water and cost in the application of LMIS.",
1415,"RESTORATION OF THE SOUTHERN BUG RIVER ECOSYSTEM BY REMOVING THE BIOMASS OF HIGHER WATER PLANTS The purpose of the study is to analyze the parameters of higher aquatic plants of the Southern Bug River using multispectral methods and a quadcopter, as well as to develop environmental protection measures to improve the ecological state of the river. The location of the Southern Bug River (Ukraine) in the zone of intensive economic activity, the illegal development of a natural backwater strip near the river causes an increased anthropogenic pressure on aquatic ecosystems, which leads to their aggravated eutrophication, one of the features of which is a growing concentration of nutrients. The bioindication of surface water quality using higher aquatic plants, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of all hydromorphological, chemical and physicochemical indicators on their development was carried out. The assessment of the ecological state of water bodies using bioindication with the multispectral method and a quadcopter was carried out. After correcting the measurement results, the parameters of higher water plants in the water body were obtained. By segmenting the water body according to selected indicators, it is possible to determine the integral effect of pollutants in a specific section of the water body.",
1416,"[Drinking water and leukemia] A retrospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the relationship between drinking water contamination and risk of leukemia in human being. It was found that the leukemia incidence rate of group D who drank the tap-water from Donghu Lake was significantly higher than that of the groups C and H who drank the tap-water from Changjiang River and Hangjiang River, RR = 1.77, 95% CL = 1.36-2.30, P < 0.01. But the difference between group C and group H is not significant. By using the sex- age-strata analysis; trend and correlation analysis, the results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the RR of incidence of leukemia and tap-water mutagenicity. It was also connected with pollution of halogenated hydrocarbons in drinking water.",
1417,"Change and Climatic Linkage for Extreme Flows in Typical Catchments of Middle Tianshan Mountain, Northwest China Due to an absence of an essential daily data set, changing characteristics, and cause of flow extremes in the Tianshan Mountains are rarely explored in depth. In this study, daily based long-term meteorological and hydrological observation data were collected in four typical watersheds in the middle Tianshan Mountains; Manne-Kendall trend analysis and Pettit's test were used to detect the trends and alterations of extreme flow series; Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV) and General Pareto distribution (GDP) models were used to describe the probability distributions of annual maximum (AM) and peaks over threshold (POT) series based on daily discharge; and the relationship between extreme flow and climate indices, were also investigated. The findings indicated that, change of the AM series at five hydrological stations experienced positive trends; the POT series generally showed no significant trends, while the peaks over threshold number (POTN) present a positive trend at the five stations. Change points exist in the POT and occurrence time of maximum daily discharge in spring (AM-SPR) series at the Kensiwate (KSWT) station in Manas watershed; the mean extreme flow decreased after 1986, and the occurrence time the annual maximum daily flow in spring significant forward after 1978. The AM series can well fit the GEV distribution, while the POT series fit the GDP distribution better; the GEV model performed worse in estimating flood events with high return period than low return period events. Moreover, acceleration of glacier melting lead to the magnitude and frequency increments of flood in the north slope; intensifying and frequent precipitation extremes are dominate factors of extreme flow variations in south slope watersheds which without large amount of glacier coverage; and continually temperature rising in spring and increased precipitation in winter lead to the change on magnitude and timing of spring extreme floods.",
1418,"Public health effects due to insufficient groundwater quality monitoring in Igando and Agbowo regions in Nigeria: A review This paper emphasizes the need for monitoring groundwater resources by analyzing the health implications of inadequate monitoring. It highlights the importance of groundwater quality monitoring in Nigeria-a country where population dependence on groundwater is 60%. The effects of Soluos dumpsite leachate in Igando, Lagos-Nigeria, and septic tank seepages in Agbowo, Ibadan-Nigeria on groundwater quality are analyzed. All samples used in this study appeared to be microbially contaminated. This is linked to too close distances [< 50 ft (15.24 m) the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommendation] between septic tanks and groundwater wells, as well as non-engineered dumpsites used for waste disposal. This shows that groundwater within the study area is unsafe for drinking purposes. Even with the clayey soil stratigraphy of the study area which is believed to influence the natural attenuation of leachate into groundwater, high concentrations of lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn) were seen in some locations around the dumpsite. The study points to the inherent cost for individuals and government due to insufficient groundwater quality which could have been otherwise avoided through groundwater monitoring and proper waste management. This review accentuates the need for improved water quality towards achieving SDG 6.1 (universal and equitable access to safe drinking water) and SDG 3 (Good health and well-being) in Nigeria.",
1419,"A Prospective Cohort Study Examining the Associations of Maternal Arsenic Exposure With Fetal Loss and Neonatal Mortality Arsenic crosses the placenta, possibly increasing the risk of adverse reproductive outcomes. We aimed to examine the association between maternal arsenic exposure and fetal/neonatal survival using data from a prospective cohort study of 1,616 maternal-infant pairs recruited at a gestational age of 16 weeks in Bangladesh (2008-2011). Arsenic concentration in maternal drinking water was measured at enrollment. Extended Cox regression (both time-dependent coefficients and step functions) was used to estimate the time-varying association between maternal arsenic exposure and fetal/neonatal death (all mortality between enrollment and 1 month after birth). In a sensitivity analysis, we assessed gestational arsenic exposure using maternal urine samples taken at enrollment. We observed 203 fetal losses and 20 neonatal deaths. Higher arsenic exposure was associated with a slightly decreased mortality rate up to the middle of the second trimester, and then the mortality rate switched directions around 20 weeks' gestation. In the step function model, the hazard ratios for combined mortality (fetal loss and neonatal death) per unit increase in the natural log of drinking water arsenic concentration (g/L) ranged from 1.35 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.69) in weeks 25-28 to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.02) in weeks 9-12. This nonlinear association suggests that arsenic may exert survival pressure on developing fetuses, potentially contributing to survival bias, and may also indicate that arsenic toxicity differs by fetal developmental stage.",1
1420,"Ground Water Quality Maps of Paravanar River Sub Basin, Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu, India Ground water is an excellent solvent, which dissolves chemicals ions as it moves through rocks and subsurface soil. This leads to more mineralization in groundwater than surface water. The objective of the present study is to examine the groundwater quality of the Paravanar River Sub-basin, Cuddalore district, Tamil Nadu, India. The Electrical Conductivity (EC) values ranges between 160 and 2,580 mu S/cm in groundwater samples. The highest value of 2,580 mu S/cm was recorded in wells near the coast. pH values ranges from 7.2 to 8.6. NNE and southern part of the study area has low pH values, rest of the area represents the alkaline nature of groundwater. In south eastern part of the study area alkali values are slightly higher but it is within WHO's tolerable limits. The spatial distribution of chloride concentration shows that Meenatchipettai, Vazhisothani palayam and Allapakkam represents maximum Cl(2) concentration of 527, 320 and 374 ppm, which is above ISI drinking standards of 250 ppm. Increase in isochlore is observed from the coast up to the Neyveli lignite mine. Nitrate concentration of groundwater samples ranges from 0.1 mg/l to 64 mg/l. As most of the study area is cultivated, fertilizers used for agriculture may be the cause for increase in concentration of nitrates in few concentrated locations.",
1421,"Characterization of siderophore producing arsenic-resistant Staphylococcus sp. strain TA6 isolated from contaminated groundwater of Jorhat, Assam and its possible role in arsenic geocycle BACKGROUND: Microorganisms specifically bacteria play a crucial role in arsenic mobilization and its distribution in aquatic systems. Although bacteria are well known for their active participation in the different biogeochemical cycles, the role of these bacteria in regulating the concentration of arsenic in Brahmaputra valley has not been investigated in detail. RESULTS: In this paper, we report the isolation of an arsenic resistant bacterium TA6 which can efficiently reduce arsenate. The isolate identified as Staphylococcus sp. TA6 based on the molecular and chemotaxonomic identification (FAME) showed resistance to the high concentration of both arsenate and arsenite (As(III)â€‰=â€‰30Â mM; As(V)â€‰=â€‰250Â mM), along with cross-tolerance to other heavy metals viz., Hg(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+)(,) Cr(2+). The bacterium also had a high siderophore activity (78.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.004Â Î¼mol) that positively correlated with its ability to resist arsenic. The isolate, Staphylococcus sp. TA6 displayed high bio-transformation ability and reduced 2Â mM As(V) initially added into As(III) in a period of 72Â h with 88.2% efficiency. The characterization of arsenate reductase enzyme with NADPH coupled assay showed the highest activity at pHÂ 5.5 and temperature of 50Â Â°C. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the role of an isolate, Staphylococcus sp. TA6, in the biotransformation of arsenate to arsenite. The presence of ars operon along with the high activity of the arsenate reductase and siderophore production in this isolate may have played an important role in mobilizing arsenate to arsenite and thus increasing the toxicity of arsenic in the aquatic systems of the Brahmaputra valley.",
1422,"Seasonal changes in dissolved trace elements and human health risk in the upper and middle reaches of the Bhavani River, southern India The surface water is a significant feature in the hydrological system and is a vital compound for life growth. Assessment of trace elements in the water bodies is essential since it poses huge threats to aquatic organisms and humans if present in high concentrations. This study was carried out to assess the seasonal changes in the dissolved trace elements concentration in Bhavani river, which is one of the major rivers of Tamil Nadu, southern India and also to assess the human health risk due to its consumption. A total of 46 surface water samples were collected along the river during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon of 2018 and were analyzed for various trace elements such as Zn, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Pb. The variation in trace element concentration is observed spatially, where higher concentration is found in samples from agricultural and urban areas than the samples from the undisturbed natural-mountain terrains. The results highlighted that the concentrations of trace elements differ temporally where the concentration is greater during the monsoon due to increased discharge of sewage and agricultural run off to the river. Multivariate statistical analysis indicates stronger relationship between trace elements and other physio-chemical parameters hinting that natural and anthropogenic sources alters the riverine chemistry. Thus, the rainfall-runoff characteristics along with lithology, topography, and landuse of the basin plays a dominant role in the seasonal variation of dissolved trace elements. The water quality index value shows ""good/excellent"" during pre-monsoon and ""marginal/fair"" during monsoon season and the Heavy Metal Pollution Index values were also low during both the seasons. The river water samples which defy these indices were found to be either from urban or agricultural lands. The oral and dermal ingestion health risk to adults was assessed, which indicates that the risks posed to humans by consumption of water were minimal. The trace metal concentration of the river was then compared with the other rivers of world and India, where it shows that Zn, Cu, and Ni concentration was higher in Bhavani than in most of the rivers. Thus, the study highlighted that the urban settlements and agricultural lands have a considerable influence on river quality thereby triggering the increase in trace element concentrations. Therefore, the study necessitates on the continuous monitoring of river along with adoption of stringent discharge protocols.",1
1423,"Characterizing the impact of MnO2 on the [47-49]efficiency of Fe0-based filtration systems Significant research has been conducted on the design of filtration systems containing metallic iron for environmental remediation (Fe0 walls) over the past 20years. However, limited information exists on the rationale for sustainable Fe0 walls. Additionally, very limited research has been conducted on the modification of the efficiency of the system by the addition of solid phases. This research aimed at characterizing the impact of reactive natural manganese oxides (MnO2) in influencing the extent of methylene blue (MB) discoloration by a Fe0/sand system in gravity driven column experiments. A total of seven columns were used in parallel experiments. Investigated systems are: pure Fe0, pure sand, Fe0/sand mixture and four different Fe0/MnO2/sand mixtures. The volumetric ratio of Fe0 in hybrid systems was 30%. In three-components-systems, the volumetric ratio of each additive was 35%. Each system was characterized by the time-dependent evolution of the pH value, the iron and MB breakthrough, and the evolution of the hydraulic conductivity (permeability). Results showed enhanced MB discoloration in all Fe0/MnO2/sand systems relative to the Fe0/sand system. The impact of MnO2 on system's permeability could not be accessed because of the poor mechanic properties of tested minerals. However, the feasibility of sustaining the efficiency of Fe0 walls by admixing granular MnO2 is demonstrated. This tool will help in the development of more sustainable Fe0 walls. Such systems could also lead to substantial improvement of drinking water supply and wastewater treatment in the developing world. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

This investigation emphasized on the hydrochemical evaluation and drinking water quality assessment in District Jacobabad located in lower Indus plain, Pakistan. Certainly world's largest irrigation system emerged from Indus Basin, which is underlain by well transmissive aquifer resulting in higher water table. Water supply schemes with their water sources from ground water and surface water provide piped water for drinking purpose to the community. Water samples were collected from all the forty eight supply schemes of which thirty two were found nonfunctional. Analytical parameters were compared with World Health Organization (WHO) and Pakistan Water Quality Standards but adversely substantial samples were found nonpotable. Alkalinity, bicarbonate and nitrate met the standard safe limits while values for EC, TDS, hardness, cations and anions exceeded the limits in numerous samples. SPSS and ArcGIS softwares were used for statistical analysis and spatial distribution of parameters. Hydrochemical facies were developed and suitability assessment of water resources was examined for agricultural use.

1426,"Chronic arsenic toxicity: clinical features, epidemiology, and treatment: experience in West Bengal Chronic arsenic toxicity due to drinking arsenic-contaminated water has been one of the worst environmental health hazards affecting eight districts of West Bengal since the early eighties. Detailed clinical examination and investigation of 248 such patients revealed protean clinical manifestations of such toxicity. Over and above hyperpigmentation and keratosis, weakness, anaemia, burning sensation of eyes, solid swelling of legs, liver fibrosis, chronic lung disease, gangrene of toes, neuropathy, and skin cancer are some of the other manifestations. A cross-sectional survey involving 7683 participants of all ages was conducted in an arsenic-affected region between April 1995 and March 1996. Out of a population of 7683 surveyed, 3467 and 4216 people consumed water containing As below and above 0.05 mg/L, respectively. Except pain abdomen the prevalence of all other clinical manifestations tested (e.g., pigmentation, keratosis, hepatomegaly, weakness, nausea, lung disease and neuropathy) were found to be significantly higher in As exposed people (water As > 0.05 mg/L) compared to control population (water As level < 0.05 mg/L). The prevalence of pigmentation and keratosis, hepatomegaly, chronic respiratory disease and weakness rose significantly with increasing arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The respiratory effects were most pronounced in individuals with high arsenic water concentrations who also had skin lesion. Therapy with chelating agent DMSA was not found to be superior to placebo effect. However, therapy with DMPS caused significant improvement of clinical condition of chronic arsenicosis patients as evidenced by significant reduction of total clinical scores from 8.90 +/- 2.84 to 3.27 +/- 1.73; p < 0.0001. Efficacy of specific chelation therapy for patients suffering from chronic As toxicity has further need to be fully substantiated. However, supportive treatment could help in reducing many symptoms of the patients. Treatment in hospital with good nutritious diet has been found to reduce symptom score in a subset of placebo treated patients in West Bengal during the course of DMSA and DMPS trial. People should be advised to stop drinking As contaminated water or exposure to As from any other source. The various clinical manifestations should be treated symptomatically.",1
1427,"Groundwater geochemical facie: implications of rock-water interaction at the Chamba city (HP), northwest Himalaya, India The present study describes geochemical facie and implications of rock-water interaction at the groundwater of Chamba city. The influence of rock dominance at the groundwater may be due to its flow and longtime rock-water interaction, whereas atmospheric precipitation dominance owing to high recharge and continuous outflow of groundwater that cause a short time interaction. The comparison among Ca(2+) + Mg(2+) versus Na(+) + K(+) and total cations indicated carbonate weathering as a main ionic source relative to silicate weathering, due to rich lithology and higher dissolution capacity of carbonate minerals. The chloro-alkaline indices (CAI-1 and CAI-2) and scatter plot of (Ca(2+) + Mg(2+)) - (HCO(3)- + SO(4)(2)-) versus (Na(+) + K(+)) - Cl- (meq/L) inferred the presence of ion exchange process causing adsorption of Ca(2+) and release of Na(+). The Ca(2+) - Mg(2+) - Cl-, Na(+) - HCO(3)-, and Ca(2+) - Mg(2+) - HCO(3)- types of groundwater suggested permanent and temporary hardness in the region. The Ca(2+) and Na(+) are observed as the dominant cations whereas HCO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) as the dominant anions. The parameters like NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-), F(-), and Br(-) are generated from different natural sources. The groundwater is found to be suitable for drinking purposes based on water quality index (14.24-61.13) and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS 2012) prescribed limit. The influence of carbonate minerals dissolution over TDS and salinity at groundwater of the city is also observed. The rock-water interaction confirmed mixing pattern of carbonate, silicate, and evaporites in the groundwater of the Chamba city.",
1428,"Successful Use of Geoelectrical Surveys in Area 3 of the Gol-e-Gohar Iron Ore Mine, Iran Geoelectrical surveys were conducted in Area 3 of the Gol-e-Gohar iron ore mine to provide geological and hydrogeological information. Open pit mining is currently underway in the northern part of the Area, and underground mining operations are planned for the southern section. Groundwater has already been encountered in the open pit mine. Twenty five resistivity soundings were first performed in the mine area; then, induced polarization (IP) measurements were carried out to remove ambiguities between clay and water-bearing layers. To investigate fault zones as water conduits, combined resistivity profiling surveys were also carried out. These measurements provided a detailed structural map of the pit area. Resistivity and IP results have subsequently been confirmed by observations at three monitoring wells and the mine pit wall. Monitoring and piezometric wells will be drilled at locations suggested by the results of the geoelectrical surveys. Drainage galleries may be developed to dewater the open pit mine. However, another option being considered is to start the underground mining with the idea that it will initially simply serve as a dewatering mechanism.",
1429,"The carbon fertilization effect over a century of anthropogenic CO2 emissions: higher intracellular CO2 and more drought resistance among invasive and native grass species contrasts with increased water use efficiency for woody plants in the US Southwest From 1890 to 2015, anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions have increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 270 to 400mol mol(-1). The effect of increased carbon emissions on plant growth and reproduction has been the subject of study of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments. These experiments have found (i) an increase in internal CO2 partial pressure (c(i)) alongside acclimation of photosynthetic capacity, (ii) variable decreases in stomatal conductance, and (iii) that increases in yield do not increase commensurate with CO2 concentrations. Our data set, which includes a 115-year-long selection of grasses collected in New Mexico since 1892, is consistent with an increased c(i) as a response to historical CO2 increase in the atmosphere, with invasive species showing the largest increase. Comparison with Palmer Drought Sensitivity Index (PDSI) for New Mexico indicates a moderate correlation with C-13 (r(2)=0.32, P<0.01) before 1950, with no correlation (r(2)=0.00, P=0.91) after 1950. These results indicate that increased c(i) may have conferred some drought resistance to these grasses through increased availability of CO2 in the event of reduced stomatal conductance in response to short-term water shortage. Comparison with C-3 trees from arid environments (Pinus longaeva and Pinus edulis in the US Southwest) as well as from wetter environments (Bromus and Poa grasses in New Mexico) suggests differing responses based on environment; arid environments in New Mexico see increased intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE) in response to historic elevated CO2 while wetter environments see increased c(i). This study suggests that (i) the observed increases in c(i) in FACE experiments are consistent with historical CO2 increases and (ii) the CO2 increase influences plant sensitivity to water shortage, through either increased WUE or c(i) in arid and wet environments, respectively.",
1430,"Bubble-propelled micromotors based on hierarchical MnO2 wrapped carbon nanotube aggregates for dynamic removal of pollutants Water pollution is currently an urgent public health and environmental issue. Bubble-propelled micromotors might offer an effective approach for dealing with environmental contamination. Herein, we present the synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/manganese dioxide (MnO2) micromotors based on MWCNT aggregates as microscale templates by a simple one-step hydrothermal procedure. The morphology, composition, and structure of the obtained MWCNT/MnO2 micromotors were characterized in detail. The MnO2 nanoflakes formed a catalytic layer on the MWCNT backbone, which promoted effective bubble evolution and propulsion at remarkable speeds of 359.31 mu m s(-1). The bubble velocity could be modulated based on the loading of MnO2 nanoflakes. The rapid movement of these MWCNT/MnO2 catalytic micromotors resulted in a highly efficient moving adsorption platform, which considerably enhanced the effectiveness of water purification. Dynamic adsorption of organic dyes by the micromotors increased the degradation rate to approximately 4.8 times as high as that of their corresponding static counterparts. The adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics were also explored. The adsorption mechanism was well fitted by the Langmuir model, following pseudo-second-order kinetics. Thus, chemisorption of Congo red at the heterogeneous MnO2 wrapped microimotor surface was the rate determining step. The high propulsion speed and remarkable decontamination efficiency of the MWCNT/MnO2 micromotors indicate potential for environmental contamination applications.",
1431,"Optimizing Water Productivity using Deficit Irrigation, the case of Koga Irrigation project, Ethiopia Continuous increase of population in Ethiopia, high water demand, occurrence of drought and poor efficiency of irrigation systems lead to real burden on the natural water resources. Finding optimal solution under high demand and limited water supply in the area of farm conditions is complex and requires the use of optimization methods. Thus, optimal irrigation planning and management should be considered for water resource allocation. In this study, linear programming (LP) model was applied for allocation of water for Koga irrigation scheme, Ethiopia using three level of deficit (10%, 20%, 30% ET) irrigation. The objective was to maximize annual net benefit and water productivity considering, water and crop diversification constraints. The model was solved using Microsoft Excel Solver and CROPWAT 8.0 model was used for estimation of crop water requirement at 80 % dependable rainfall. The study indicated that using deficit irrigation, a total of 241.2, 206.9, 179.6 million birr net benefit and 4.0, 3.8, 3.8 birr/m(3) water productivity were achieved using 10%, 20% and 30% deficit irrigation respectively while the actual practice were 229.8 million net benefit and 3.4 birr/m(3). Applying 10% deficit irrigation, the net benefit increases by 5 % while water productivity by 18% as compared to the existing practice. But using 20% and 30% deficit, the net benefit decrease by 10% and 22% respectively while water productivity remain better. Therefore, using 10% deficit irrigation, there could be possibility of irrigating 7349 ha land with better net benefit and water productivity.",
1432,"U-238 and Th-232 isotopes in groundwater of Jordan: Geological influence, water chemistry, and health impact An extensive pioneer study was conducted to determine the activity concentration of U-238 and Th-232 in 94 groundwater samples to examine the influence of geological formations on the activity concentrations of U-238 and Th-232 and to investigate a relationship with the major chemical elements in groundwater. The study also aims to estimate the annual effective dose and health impact due to the intake of these radionuclides in the groundwater of Jordan. The mean activity concentrations of U-238 and Th-232 in groundwater were found to be 33 +/- 5 mBq L-1 and 0.017 +/- 0.002 mBq L-1, respectively. The highest mean of U-238 and Th-232 activity concentrations were found for lower Cretaceous geological formation, while Tertiary and Quaternary geological formations have the lowest mean U-238 and Th-232 activity concentration, respectively. The output of (ANOVA) and post hoc tests revealed the existence of significant influence of geological formations on U-238 activity concentrations, while insignificant influence on Th-232 activity concentrations was found in the groundwater of Jordan. The groundwater of Jordan was dominated by HCO3-1, Cl--1,Cl- Ca+2, and Na+1. The mean annual effective dose due to the ingestion of radionuclides U-238 and Th-232 in groundwater were found 1.143 mu Sv lower than recommended by WHO. The ingestion dose deduced is dominated by U-238 of 99% where the average contribution from Th-232 amounted to 1%. The results of the study will serve as a baseline data of U-238 and Th-232 activity concentrations in groundwater based on geological formations of Jordan.",1
1433,"Petrogenesis and oxidation state of granodiorite porphyry in the Jurassic Chuankeng skarn Cu deposit, South China: Implications for the Cu fertility and mineralization potential Large-scale Jurassic porphyry-skarn Cu mineralization in the Qin-Hang metallogenic belt of South China has attracted much attention, but comparative studies of porphyries in large- and small-scale deposits are lacking. In this paper, we present new zircon U-Pb ages, trace element composition and Hf isotopic composition as well as whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions for the porphyries associated with mineralization in the small-scale Chuankeng Cu deposit. Drawing on our data for the Chuankeng deposit and existing data for the nearby giant Dexing Cu deposit, we aim to identify factors controlling the mineralization potential of both deposits. Granodiorite porphyries of Chuankeng deposit were emplaced at ca. 161-158 Ma. They have moderate SiO2 contents of 61.9-66.1 wt% and high Sr/Y (59-135) and (La/Yb)(N) (4-14) ratios. Their high MgO contents (0.2-29 wt%), lack of negative Eu anomaly, depletion in Y and Yb, relatively high initial Sr-86/Sr-87 ratios (0.7076-0.7078), and low epsilon(Nd)(t) values (- 4.5 to - 4.9), indicating that the Chuankeng porphyries were derived from partial melting of delaminated lower crust. The Middle-Late Jurassic Chuankeng porphyries are considered to have been formed in a localized infra-continental extension environment along the Jiangshao Fault in response to far-field stress from Paleo-Pacific Plate subduction. Although no Middle-Late Jurassic magmatic arc rocks have been found in the study area, the Chuankeng porphyries display similar characteristics to arc rocks. On the basis of their zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (- 2.6 to +0.9), two-stage Hf model ages (1.4-1.1 Ga), and regional geological history, we infer that magma source of Chuankeng porphyries were mainly Neoproterozoic juvenile crust with the involvement of Paleoproterozoic ancient crust. Thus their arc-like features were inherited from the Neoproterozoic juvenile crust that formed by subduction of oceanic crust during the Jiangnan orogeny. Chuankeng porphyries have lower zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ and higher Ti-in-zircon temperatures and lower whole rock epsilon(Nd) and zircon epsilon(Hf) values than the Dexing porphyries, indicating they are less oxidized and less hydrous and with more involvement of the ancient crustal material in the magma source, which could explain the relatively small-scale Cu mineralization in Chuankeng. This study highlights the values of integrated studies of whole rock Nd and zircon trace element and Hf isotopic compositions in assessing the potential for Cu mineralization.",
1434,"Spatial prediction of flood-susceptible areas using frequency ratio and maximum entropy models Modelling the flood in watersheds and reducing the damages caused by this natural disaster is one of the primary objectives of watershed management. This study aims to investigate the application of the frequency ratio and maximum entropy models for flood susceptibility mapping in the Madarsoo watershed, Golestan Province, Iran. Based on the maximum entropy and frequency ratio methods as well as analysis of the relationship between the flood events belonging to training group and the factors affecting on the risk of flooding, the weight of classes of each factor was determined in a GIS environment. Finally, prediction map of flooding potential was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. ROC curve estimated the area under the curve for frequency ratio and the maximum entropy models as 74.3% and 92.6%, respectively, indicating that the maximum entropy model led to better results for evaluating flooding potential in the study area.",
1435,"Nitrate toxicosis in beef and dairy cattle herds due to contamination of drinking water and whey Four cases of rarely reported nitrate toxicosis due to contamination of drinking water or whey were recorded in 2 beef and 2 dairy cattle herds. In the cases associated with water contamination, water containing ammonium nitrate as a fertilizer for irrigating orchards accidentally entered drinking water troughs for cattle through malfunctioning 1-way valves. The whey contamination in 1 instance was caused by transportation in containers which contained traces of concentrated ammonium nitrate; the 2nd case was induced by whey derived from the production of a specialty cheese produced by the incorporation of nitrate. Mortality occurred in 2 herds and abortions in the 2 other herds. Affected cows responded well to treatment, but some animals remained in a deteriorated physical condition for several months.",
1436,"Investigation of the physical and chemical characteristics of rural solid waste in China and its spatiotemporal distributions Despite governmental efforts toward the development of policies, funds, and technologies, the inherent characteristics of rural solid waste (RSW) discharge have led to great difficulties in RSW pollution control. However, establishing a realistic management strategy requires greater knowledge of RSW generation. Therefore, the RSW of 72 typical towns and villages from 12 provinces of China was analyzed for physicochemical characteristics, as well as its spatiotemporal distribution. The largest proportion of kitchen waste, coal ash, plastic, and paper of RSW was 33.70%â€‰Â±â€‰17.87%, 26.50%â€‰Â±â€‰17.61%, 13.48%â€‰Â±â€‰5.68%, and 10.75%â€‰Â±â€‰5.75%, respectively, in 2015. Although RSW had the potential for composting, it was still necessary to pay special attention to heavy metals pollution of RSW. The spatiotemporal distributions of RSW components were extremely non-homogenous, and significant variations existed in the kitchen residue, coal ash, plastic, and paper because of differences in economic growth, climatic changes, dietary habits, energy consumption structure, and consumer preferences. No obvious differences in RSW components were observed between villages and market towns. Overall, RSW treatment and management approaches should be considered based on local conditions of RSW generation.",
1437,"Metallosphaera cuprina sp. nov., an acidothermophilic, metal-mobilizing archaeon A novel acidothermophilic archaeon, strain Ar-4(T), was isolated from a sulfuric hot spring in Tengchong, Yunnan, China. Cells of strain Ar-4(T) were Gram-staining-negative, irregular cocci and motile by means of flagella. Strain Ar-4(T) grew over a temperature range of 55-75 Â°C (optimum, 65 Â°C), a pH range of 2.5-5.5 (optimum, pH 3.5) and a NaCl concentration range of 0-1â€Š% (w/v). The novel strain was aerobic and facultatively chemolithoautotrophic. The strain could extract metal ions from sulfidic ore. It was also able to oxidize reduced sulfur compounds. In addition, it was able to use heterogeneous organic materials for organotrophic growth. The main cellular lipids were calditoglycerocaldarchaeol (CGTE) and caldarchaeol (DGTE). The DNA G+C content of the strain was 40.2 mol%. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain Ar-4(T) was phylogenetically related to members of the genus Metallosphaera and had sequence similarities of 97.7â€Š%, 97.0â€Š% and 96.8â€Š% with Metallosphaera hakonensis DSM 7519(T), Metallosphaera sedula DSM 5348(T) and Metallosphaera prunae DSM 10039(T), respectively. Strain Ar-4(T) showed DNA-DNA relatedness values of 47.5â€Š%, 30.8â€Š% and 29.1â€Š% with M. hakonensis DSM 7519(T), M. sedula DSM 5348(T) and M. prunae DSM 10039(T), respectively. The differences in cell motility, the temperature and pH ranges for growth, the ability to utilize carbon sources, the DNA G+C content, and the low DNA-DNA relatedness values distinguished strain Ar-4(T) from recognized species of the genus Metallosphaera. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that strain Ar-4(T) represents a novel species of the genus Metallosphaera, for which the name Metallosphaera cuprina is proposed. The type strain is Ar-4(T) (â€Š=â€ŠJCM 15769(T)â€Š=â€ŠCGMCC 1.7082(T)).",
1438,"Participatory multi-criteria evaluation of alternative options for water supply in cyclone-prone areas of Bangladesh Availability of safe drinking water is considered a key challenge in the coastal region of Bangladesh. High concentrations of salinity, iron and arsenic, and the unavailability of suitable aquifers, have deterred the exploitation of groundwater resources. In addition the cyclonic storm surge is a major threat to this system. Cyclones accompanied by storm surges in the coastal area cause significant deterioration of drinking water supply and sanitation. Water professionals have launched some initiatives to promote small-scale, alternative safe water sources (e. g. rainwater harvesting, pond sand filters and piped water techniques) to provide sustainable solutions to the problem. However, a systematic evaluation of the alternatives that considers social, technical and economic criteria has not been carried out so far. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the alternative options for drinking water supply in a cyclone-prone area. The authors conducted a multi-criteria analysis and reached the conclusion that rainwater harvesting is the most suitable option for the area. Moreover, the final result was shared with the users to obtain their feedback to ensure sustainability of the water source.",
1439,"Bi-tech wells: an effective arsenic mitigation method With more than 150 million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal exposed to arsenic through drinking water, arsenic mitigation projects are common in the region, including many failed and abandoned projects. Our nonprofit organization, Project Well, has been working since 2001 to provide cheap, easily adaptable safe-water solutions suitable for the local socioeconomic environment. After years of research and experimentation, Project Well has developed a 'bi-tech' well that fulfills these criteria by tapping arsenic-safe surface water from unconfined aquifers. From 2001 to 2009, Project Well constructed dugwells modified from local traditional dugwells; one important modification was that water was extracted using hand pumps rather than rope-and-bucket, to minimize bacterial contamination. A sizeable percentage of these dugwells were dry during the summer seasons, so in 2009 we began constructing 'bi-tech' wells that combined the features of our bacterial-growth-preventing dugwells with the depth of borewells (8 meters). In the summer of 2014, 94% of bi-tech wells contained water compared to 53% of our modified dugwells. Fecal coliform and E. coli were undetected in tests conducted in 2011 and 2014. In 2015, arsenic concentrations were <10 ppb in 95% of the wells. Bi-tech well maintenance is simple, with dredging rarely necessary, and easy for communities to learn. With its low construction costs, easy maintenance, and consistent safe-water output, bi-tech wells are proving an effective water solution in parts of rural India where piped water is not available.",1
1440,Congo red dye removal under the influence of rotating magnetic field by polypyrrole magnetic nanocomposite Studies on magnetic field exposure of congo red contaminated water employing polypyrrole magnetic nanocomposite is reported. Alternating magnetic poles as a function of time has been used to move functionalized nanoparticles in congo red contaminated water. A maximum removal of 94% was observed for the adsorption of 100 mg/L of the adsorbate using 0.15 g of adsorbent at a magnetic field and exposure time of 18.99 mT and 120 min. Percentage of congo red dye removed increased with an increase in the magnetic exposure time of 10-120 min (79-94%). The magnetic force exerted on the magnetic nanoparticles leads to increased adsorption of congo red owing to increased velocity and reorientation of the charged particles. The Langmuir isotherm model had the highest correlation coefficient value and fitted well with the experimental data. The maximum adsorption capacity of 119.76 mg/g was observed using this isotherm model.,
1441,"Sedimentological impact on reservoir quality of Es1 sandstone of Shahejie formation, Nanpu Sag, East China Comprehensive sedimentological studies regarding different facies types and the factors persuading their development were carried out at Eocene (Es1) member of Shahejie formation of Nanpu Sag. To evaluate the sedimentary facies, lithofacies, and reservoir quality, wireline log analysis, a petrographic thin-section study, SEM, grain size analysis, XRD, and CL analysis were used. The Es1 consists of five sedimentary facies and seven lithofacies. Sandstone is classified on the basis of standard rock classification scheme as feldspathic litharenite and lithic arkose. Quartz grains are abundant detrital constituent and feldspars are subordinate followed by mica, chert, rock fragments, and iron oxide as a minor constituent. Primary intergranular pores, as well as secondary dissolution pores and fracture pores, are also present that enhance the reservoir quality. Grain size varies from conglomerate to clay size, with massive bedding, cross-bedding, and fine-grained ripple laminated sandstone, which predicts that formation is deposited in lacustrine and fluvial channel or channel bar environment. XRD and SEM analysis show various clay minerals that reduced the reservoir characteristics. The present study discloses the deposition and distribution of lacustrine, braided, meandering river delta, and delta front sand bodies of Es1 member as well as provides some support for reservoir quality of the correlative sedimentary system that has great significance for further exploration.",
1442,"Impact of Tropical Initial Water Vapor from MT-SAPHIR Observations on Medium-Range Forecasts Using the KMA Operational Model The proper representation of water vapor helps set accurate initial conditions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Water vapor levels have been observed over the tropics by the Sounder for Atmospheric Profiling of Humidity in the Inter-tropics by Radiometry (SAPHIR) on the Megha-Tropiques (MT) satellite. To determine how tropical convection, which is relevant to water vapor levels, can affect medium-range forecasts in both the tropics and extratropics, we compare the differences between simulations with and without MT-SAPHIR data using the operational NWP model from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which includes a hybrid four-dimensional variational process in data assimilation. More observed water vapor in the lower tropical troposphere leads to stronger tropical convection, which is well represented in the 300 hPa velocity potential, and strengthens mean meridional circulation. Root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for relative humidity, temperature, and wind fields in the tropics are reduced by up to 7%. This improvement enhances the forecast field in the middle latitudes. In particular, RMSEs are reduced by up to 3.5% in the humidity field in the extratropics. Overall, the correct simulation of tropical water vapor via MT-SAPHIR data improves medium-range forecasts in the extratropics.",
1443,"Optimization of a new resin, Amberlyst 36, as a solid-phase extractor and determination of copper(II) in drinking water and tea samples by flame atomic absorption spectrometry A new simple and reliable method has been developed to separate and preconcentrate trace copper ion in drinking water and tea samples for subsequent measurement by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The copper ions are adsorbed quantitatively during passage of aqueous solutions through Amberlyst 36 cation exchange resin. After the separation and preconcentration stage, the analyte was eluted with a potassium cyanide solution and determined by FAAS. Different factors including pH of sample solution, sample volume, amount of resin, flow rate of aqueous solution, volume and concentration of eluent, and matrix effects for preconcentration were examined. The analytical figures of merit for the determination of copper are as follows: analytical detection limit (3 sigma), 0.26 microg/L; precision (RSD), 3.1% for 100 microg/L; enrichment factor, 200 (using 1000 mL of sample solution and 5 mL of eluent); time of analysis, 3.5 h (for obtaining enrichment factor of 200); capacity of resin, 125 mg/g. The method was applied for copper determination by FAAS in tap water, commercial natural spring water, commercial treated drinking water, and commercial tea bag sample. The accuracy of the method is confirmed by analyzing tea leaves (GBW 07605). The results demonstrated good agreement with the certified values.",
1444,"Assessing the Vulnerability of Agriculture Systems to Climate Change in Coastal Areas: A Novel Index This study proposes a novel index to evaluate agricultural vulnerability to climate change in coastal areas, using the case of Andhra Pradesh, the state with the second longest coastline in India. Field data was collected from more than 1000 farmers (involved in over 50 varieties of crops) in 22 riverine and coastal case study areas. Data was collected through site visits, surveys and five workshops conducted between November 2018 and June 2019. Based on the collected data sets, a new Agricultural Coastal Vulnerability Index (AGCVI) was developed and applied to the 22 sites located in two districts (Krishna and Guntur) of Coastal Andhra Pradesh. The analysis revealed that the areas with three crop seasons (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid) per year are highly vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, sites with one crop season (Kharif) per annum are the least vulnerable to climate change. Moreover, grains (particularly rice), flowers and fruit crops are more susceptible to climate change and its induced impacts. Rice is no longer a profitable crop in the case study areas partly as a result of unfavourable weather conditions, inadequate insurance provision and lack of government support for farmers. Cumulatively, all these circumstances impact farmers' incomes and socio-cultural practices: this is leading to a marriage crisis, with a reduction in the desirability of matrimony to farmers. These findings provide valuable information that can support climate and agriculture policies, as well as sustainable cropping patterns among farmers' communities in coastal areas of India in the future.",
1445,"Nanostructured gold in ancient Ayurvedic calcined drug 'swarnabhasma' Background: Swarnabhasma (calcined gold) is a famous ancient Ayurvedic medicine. However, its detail characteristic investigations are very limited. Objective: Herein, investigation of swarnabhasma is demonstrated using ancient and ultramodern techniques to understand the physicochemical nature of this drug, and to understand whether the mercury [Parada] used during preparation method marks its presence in swarnabhasma. Materials and methods: The investigated swarnabhasma was prepared by repeated incinerations of Au -Hg-Lemon juice amalgamation and sulphur. The bhasma was tested by all traditional tests of rasashastra. It was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscopy (FE-TEM), Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and gravimetric analysis. Results: Traditional tests of rasashastra were complied by the sample. XRD confirms that swarnabhasma consists of principally pure gold at nanoscale. FE-SEM showed agglomerated particles. FE-TEM showed that swarnabhasma contains highly crystalline nanostructured gold comprised with spherical gold nanoparticles of size, 5-20 nm. ICP-AES exhibited absolute absence of Hg and presence of Au, Si, Ag, Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Sr, Ti, and Zn. EDXRF confirmed the absence of mercury and confirmed the presence of Au, Si, Zr, Nb, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, and Ni. FTIR confirmed presence of water molecules adsorbed over surface of bhasma. Gravimetric analysis confirmed presence of 95% gold. Conclusion: Nano-structuring of gold enhances the surface area as well as activity. The present investigation shows that the entire process from rasashastra confers the unique nanostructure to gold and same is responsible for its medicinal potential. This nanomedicine is highly stable, which is specified as niruttha and apunarbhava in rasashastra. (C) 2021 The Authors.

1446,"Cowpea Ecophysiological Responses to Accumulated Water Deficiency during the Reproductive Phase in Northeastern Para, Brazil Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is a leguminous species widely cultivated in northern and northeastern Brazil. In the state of Para, this crop still has low productivity due to several factors, such as low soil fertility and climatic adversity, especially the water deficiency. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating the physiological parameters and the productivity of cowpea plants under different water depths. The experiment was conducted in Castanhal/Para between 2015 and 2016. A randomized block design was applied with six replications and four treatments, represented by the replacement of 100%, 50%, 25% and 0% of the water lost during crop evapotranspiration (ETc), starting from the reproductive stage. The rates of net photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf transpiration (E-leaf), substomatal CO2 concentration (Ci), leaf temperature (T-leaf) and leaf water potential (psi(w)) were determined in four measurements at the R5, R7, R8 and R9 phenological stages. Cowpea was sensitive to the water availability in the soil, showing a significant difference between treatments for physiological variables and productivity. Upon reaching a psi(w) equal to -0.88 MPa, the studied variables showed important changes, which allows establishing this value as a threshold for the crop regarding water stress under such experimental conditions. The different water levels in the soil directly influenced productivity for both years, indicating that the proper water supply leads to better crop growth and development, increasing productivity.",
1447,"Global pollution The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the danger of pollution of the global environment. Pollution is a result of the civilization development. This problem becomes important, especially due to industry. The diffusion of pollutants in air, water and soil influences the quality of environment in large areas. Because the pollutants due to accumulation act in time, they disturb the ecological equilibrium. In this way pollution acts on the global environment. To improve the quality of ecosystems it is necessary to develop ""green industries"" with new technologies. Examples were presented by the pollution in Romania due to development especially of mixed industries such in Copsa Mica, or due to mining industry such in Rosia Montana. The pollution with heavy metals, cyanides as well organic compounds was also examined. The radioactive pollution was also discussed. The conclusion is that it is necessary to educate seriously the population in the field of the environmental protection.",
1448,"Realization of a Cartographic GIS for the Filing and Management of the Archaelogical Excavations in the Nelson's Island The island of Nelson is situated around 7-8 miles far from the Egyptian Mediterranean coast, and about 25 km far from Alexandria of Egypt. It has small size, since it doesn't currently overcome the 350 m(2), even if in the antiquity it was greater: geologic phenomena and activity of cave sensibly reduced the emerged part of it. Campaigns of excavation were carried on that have brought to light important rests related to a fortification and to a military installation, inscriptions of Greek and Byzantine epoch, enormous complexes for the water restocking and a necropolis of late epoch. In the circle of the collaboration in the research CMAIA the geodetic and topographic survey of the island and of the principal structures of archaeological interest are realized. The activities of excavation have not always allowed a perfect synergy with the operations of survey. Nevertheless, the collected results have been integrated with paper maps compiled by draftsmen present on site during the phases of excavation. The activity of survey has been finalized to the cartographic rebuilding of the island and subsequently to the georeferencing of all the findings both through the direct survey and through the integration of the supplied images. An information system has been compiled (database and GIS), once seen the wide massive structure of data and the difficulties of interventions on field; it led to an easier management and cataloguing of the operations of excavation and survey, as well as the accomplishment of an integrated archive of consultation and management of the archaeological, topographic, historical and documentary data.",
1449,"Bovine tuberculosis in African buffaloes: observations regarding Mycobacterium bovis shedding into water and exposure to environmental mycobacteria BACKGROUND: African buffaloes are the maintenance host for Mycobacterium bovis in the endemically infected Kruger National Park (KNP). The infection is primarily spread between buffaloes via the respiratory route, but it is not known whether shedding of M. bovis in nasal and oral excretions may lead to contamination of ground and surface water and facilitate the transmission to other animal species. A study to investigate the possibility of water contamination with M. bovis was conducted in association with a BCG vaccination trial in African buffalo. Groups of vaccinated and nonvaccinated buffaloes were kept together with known infected in-contact buffalo cows to allow natural M. bovis transmission under semi-free ranging conditions. In the absence of horizontal transmission vaccinated and control buffaloes were experimentally challenged with M. bovis. Hence, all study buffaloes in the vaccination trial could be considered potential shedders and provided a suitable setting for investigating questions relating to the tenacity of M. bovis shed in water. RESULTS: Serial water samples were collected from the drinking troughs of the buffaloes once per season over an eleven-month period and cultured for presence of mycobacteria. All water samples were found to be negative for M. bovis, but 16 non-tuberculous Mycobacterium spp. isolates were cultured. The non-tuberculous Mycobacterium species were further characterised using 5'-16S rDNA PCR-sequencing, resulting in the identification of M. terrae, M. vaccae (or vanbaalenii), M. engbaekii, M. thermoresistibile as well as at least two species which have not yet been classified. CONCLUSION: The absence of detectable levels of Mycobacterium bovis in the trough water suggests that diseased buffalo do not commonly shed the organism in high quantities in nasal and oral discharges. Surface water may therefore not be likely to play an important role in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis from buffalo living in free-ranging ecosystems. The study buffalo were, however, frequently exposed to different species of non-tuberculous, environmental mycobacteria, with an unknown effect on the buffaloes' immune response to mycobacteria.",
1450,"Status of Pomegranate Diseases of Northern Karnataka in India Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is one of the important fruit crops in arid and semi-arid regions of Karnataka. The area under pomegranate is fast dwindling due to onslaught by a number of diseases such as bacterial blight, anthracnose, wilt and dieback or decline. Bacterial blight of pomegranate caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae has assumed epidemic proportions (40-85% severity) in northern Karnataka (Bijapur, Bellary, Bagalkot) seriously threatening its cultivation. On leaves small, water soaked, brown to dark brown spots appear while on fruits oily, dark brown to black spots with L or Y shaped cracks are formed. The pathogen survives in fallen leaves and fruits during off-season and spreads through planting material, cutting secateurs and wind splashed rains. Temperatures around 31.8-35.6 degrees C with enough rainfall during July-October were found to favor disease development. Pruning in September-October, hastabahar cultivation and rest period are highly beneficial to pomegranate plants and suppress the pathogen. Spraying Bacterinashak or streptocycline (500 ppm) + copper oxychloride (2000 ppm) has been found most effective. Pomegranate wilt (Ceratocystis fimbriata) has been the most important disease in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Symptoms include yellowing of the leaves, epinasty and sudden wilting. The pathogen spreads through infected seedlings, sanitation measures such as removal and destruction of affected trees, soil sterilization with formalin (20 ml/L) check the disease. Pomegranate decline also referred to as wilt, involves poor soil and water management practices. Use of heavy and ill drained soils, close planting, excessive irrigation and fertilizers predispose the plant for disease complex. Rhizoctonia bataticola, Fusarium solani and root knot nematode as well as shot hole borer management includes soil drenching with propiconazole (0.1%) + boric acid (0.5%) + phosphoric acid (0.5%). Anthracnose of pomegranate caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is most serious during the period July-October. The disease appears as small, regular to irregular black spots on leaves, calyx region and fruits which turn later on as dark brown depressed spots. Rains, high humidity and temperatures of 20-27 degrees C favor the disease, management through carbendazim/difenconazole or thiophanate methyl at 0.1% or chlorothalonil 0.2% sprays at fortnightly intervals have been found effective. The minor diseases of pomegranate which appear occasionally in mild to less severe form include Alternaria blight, leaf spots due to Cercospora, Sphaceloma, Fusarium, Phomopsis, Drechslera, Phytophthora nicotianae and canker (Ceuthospora phyllosticta) as well as fruit spots and rots.",
1451,"Improving Accident Tolerance of Nuclear Fuel with Coated Mo-alloy Cladding In severe loss of coolant accidents (LOCA), similar to those experienced at Fukushima Daiichi and Three Mile Island Unit 1, the zirconium alloy fuel cladding materials are rapidly heated due to nuclear decay heating and rapid exothermic oxidation of zirconium with steam. This heating causes the cladding to rapidly react with steam, lose strength, burst or collapse, and generate large quantities of hydrogen gas. Although maintaining core cooling remains the highest priority in accident management, an accident tolerant fuel (ATF) design may extend coping and recovery time for operators to restore emergency power, and cooling, and achieve safe shutdown. An ATF is required to possess high resistance to steam oxidation to reduce hydrogen generation and sufficient mechanical strength to maintain fuel rod integrity and core coolability. The initiative undertaken by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an ATF cladding with capability to maintain its integrity in 1,200-1,500 degrees C steam for at least 24 hours. This ATF cladding utilizes thin-walled Mo-alloys coated with oxidation-resistant surface layers. The basic design consists of a thin-walled Mo alloy structural tube with a metallurgically bonded, oxidation-resistant outer layer. Two options are being investigated: a commercially available iron, chromium, and aluminum alloy with excellent high temperature oxidation resistance, and a Zr alloy with demonstrated corrosion resistance. As these composite claddings will incorporate either no Zr, or thin Zr outer layers, hydrogen generation under severe LOCA conditions will be greatly reduced. Key technical challenges and uncertainties specific to Mo alloy fuel cladding include: economic core design, industrial scale fabricability, radiation embrittlement, and corrosion and oxidation resistance during normal operation, transients, and severe accidents. Progress in each aspect has been made and key results are discussed in this document. In addition to assisting plants in meeting Light Water Reactor (LWR) challenges, accident-tolerant Mo-based cladding technologies are expected to be applicable for use in high-temperature helium and molten salt reactor designs, as well as nonnuclear high temperature applications.

1452,"Effects of elevated blood lead levels in preschool children in urban Vellore OBJECTIVE: To study the burden and associated risk factors for elevated blood lead levels among pre-school children (15-24 months) in urban Vellore, and to study its effects on child cognition and anemia. DESIGN: An investigative study through Mal-ED cohort. SETTING: Eight adjacent urban slums in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. PARTICIPANTS: 251 babies recruited through Mal-ED Network. OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood lead levels using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry method at 15 and 24 mo; hemoglobin estimation by azidemethemoglobin method; cognitive levels using Bayley Scales of Infant Development III. RESULTS: Around 45% of children at 15 months and 46.4% at 24 months had elevated blood lead levels (>10 Âµg/dL). Among children who had elevated blood lead levels at 15 months, 69.2% (45/65) continued to have elevated levels at 24 months. After adjusting for potential confounders, children from houses having a piped drinking water supply and houses with mud or clay floors were at significantly higher risk of having elevated blood lead levels at 15 months. Thirty one percent (21/67) of the children with elevated blood lead levels had poor cognitive scores. Children with elevated blood lead levels at 15 months had higher risk (Adjusted OR 1.80; 95% CI 0.80 - 3.99) of having poorer cognitive scores at 24 months. More than half of the children (57%) were anemic at 15 months of age, and elevated blood lead levels were not significantly associated with anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated blood lead levels are common among preschool children living in urban slums of Vellore. Poorer conditions of the living environment are associated with elevated lead levels.",
1453,"The evolution of ore-forming fluid constraints on mineralization of the Muluozhai carbonatite-related REE deposit in western Sichuan: Evidence from fluid inclusions and stable isotopes The Muluozhai rare earth element (REE) deposit located in eastern Tibetan Plateau and southwestern Yangtze, is the typical carbonatite-related REE deposit. Compared with other carbonatite-related REE deposits with complicated mineralization processes, the Muluozhai REE deposit has a completed and continuous fluid evolution process and is almost unaffected by hydrothermal alteration and late tectono-magmatic events. Therefore, it is an ideal target for understanding the mineralization process of REE deposits. Based on the detail geological investigation of the 1 : 5000 petrology-structure-alteration-mineralization mapping and the study of fluid inclusions, three periods are recognized, namely: (1) magmatic period; (2) hydrothermal period and (3) supergene period. The hydrothermal period is the main mineralization period with divided into early, middle and late stages. The results of study on fluid inclusions in fluorite, quartz and bastnasite from different hydrothermal stages show that six types are recognized, as followed: (1) melt inclusion (M type); (2) melt-fluid inclusion (ML type); (3) CO2-rich aqueous fluid inclusion (WC type); (4) solid-bearing CO2-rich fluid inclusion (SC type); (5) solid-bearing aqueous fluid inclusion (S type); and (6) aqueous-rich fluid inclusion (W type). The early hydrothermal stage is transition from magmatic to hydrothermal process. This stage is characterized by coarse-grained fluorite and barite and host M and ML types inclusions, implying that the ore-forming fluid exsolved from magma. WC, SC and S types inclusions are dominant in the fluorite and quartz from the middle hydrothermal stage whereas the W type inclusions are abundant in bastnasite from the late hydrothermal stage. Generally, the WC type inclusions with various carbonic filling degrees are interpreted as the immiscibility took place in the middle hydrothermal stage. Based on the microthermometric and isochoric results of end members of WC type inclusions, immiscibility is constrained at the temperature of 280 similar to 320 degrees C, pressure of 120 similar to 180MPa and salinities range from 2.4% to 42.4% NaCleqv. In the late hydrothermal stage, the W type inclusions in bastnasite have the constant vapor/liquid ratios, indicating that mineralization occurs in the relatively homogeneous environment. Meanwhile, the microthermometric results of W type inclusions show the mineralization occurred at the temperature of 200 similar to 260 degrees C, pressure less than 200bars and salinities ranges from 6.5% to 11.2% NaCleqv. The results of laser Raman spectrum show the solids in SC and S types inclusions are consist of barite, celestine, mirabilite and glaserite, demonstrating that the ore-forming fluid is rich in Na+, Ca2+, K+, Sr2+, Ba2+, SO42-, F- as well as Cl. In addition, the delta D and delta(18) O values of ore-forming fluid range of -96.5 parts per thousand similar to -50.1 parts per thousand and 0.9% similar to 6.4 parts per thousand, respectively, corresponding to those in other REE deposits from the same belt. This implies the ore -forming fluid might initially derived from the degasification of magma and mixed with meteoric water in the late. The delta(34) SV-CDT, values between sulfide and sulphate in the Muluozhai deposit are concentrated in -6.10 parts per thousand similar to -4. 77 parts per thousand and 4. 33 parts per thousand similar to 4. 90 parts per thousand, respectively, which are similar with those in the other REE deposits from the same region and show the characteristics of mantle. The calculation of sulfur equilibrium fractionation between sulphate and sulfide varies from 16.7 parts per thousand to 25.1 parts per thousand, which are more than the differential values (9.1 parts per thousand similar to 11.0 parts per thousand) between them, showing mineralization belongs to an open system. Based on the above results and experimental petrology, REEs migrate as [REE (SO4)(2)](-) and [REEC1](2+) complexes in the hydrothermal fluid. Immiscibility is an important process to support CO2 for mineraliza ion. But fluid cooling and mixing with meteoric water are regarded as the main mechanism of mineralization by decomposition of complexes.",
1454,"Modeling Variability of Alfisols Fertility Parameters in Micro-Watersheds of Harve, Chamarajanagara District in Semi-Arid, India Assessment of soil-fertility of a sub-watershed is pre-requisite for efficient rainfed agriculture. Soil survey was conducted in Harve sub-watershed (Kumachahalli-1,Kumachahalli-2,KG Hundi,Kengaki,Bettadapura,Sagade micro-watersheds) to assess soil homogeneity. Based on analysis of soil-fertility data, pH had lowest, while manganese (Kumachahalli-1), magnesium (Kumachahalli-2,KG Hundi,Sagade), zinc (Kengaki), copper (Bettadapura) had highest variation. Principal component (PC) analysis indicated that 5 PCs explained 66.96% (Sagade)-74.08% (Kumachahalli-2) variance. Comparison of P-1 and P-2 indicated zinc (Kengaki), copper (Bettadapura), nitrogen, carbon (Kumachahalli-1); while P-1 and P-3 indicated carbon (Sagade), magnesium, calcium (Kumachahalli-2); P-2 and P-3 indicated carbon (Kengaki) as important with loading >0.70. Comparison of variation with P-1 indicated pH (all locations), potassium (KG Hundi,Kengaki,Kumachahalli-2), electrical conductivity (Kumachahalli-2), carbon (Sagade); P-2 indicated carbon, nitrogen (Kumachahalli-1); P-3 indicated carbon (Kengaki), zinc (Sagade), calcium (Kumachahalli-2) as important. Kumachahalli-2 was superior with maximum soil homogeneity. The findings are useful for developing soil test-based fertilizer doses for crops under Alfisols.",
1455,"Sustainable development - the East Bali poverty project Sustainable development is an essential objective for all governments, whether tasked with leading a fully industrialised country or grappling with the challenges faced by developing countries. Efforts to deal with some of the major issues of the world that have loomed over the past few decades such as water and sanitation and poverty, the scale of which has primarily resulted from very large population growth over the past half century, have generally failed. This is particularly noticeable in the fast industrialising countries of Asia and in parts of Africa. In more recent times, it has been recognised that resolution of poverty problems really only succeed if the people requiring assistance are directly and fully embraced in the solutions needed, along with the approaches and procedures adopted to tackle the problems. In this paper, details are presented of the approach taken to respond to the aspirations of a desperately poor community of 15 000 in a remote area of Bali, Indonesia, with difficult access, and raise it to a situation of sustainable development. In the beginning the elders of the community prioritised education for their children as a means of providing for a better future. Before the children could respond properly, serious health issues had to be addressed, and this meant taking a long-term and holistic view with a matching schedule of parallel infrastructure and social programmes, and full participation of the community. This privately funded integrated development is now in its eleventh year, and the many challenges and solutions to achieve sustainable development are described. The project provides many lessons for adaptation, and is already providing selective assistance elsewhere.",
1456,"Arsenic contamination and secondary mineral evaluation in mine drainage using integrated acid-base accounting and toxicity characterisation leaching procedure: the case of Obuasi Mine, Ghana This study assessed arsenic (As) contamination and the characteristics of secondary minerals in mine drainage using integrated acid-base accounting (ABA) and toxicity characterisation leaching procedure (TCLP), aqueous and solid-phase media monitoring, as well as a textural and mineralogical analysis of tailings material at the Obuasi mine in Ghana. The neutralisation potential and maximum potential acidity from an ABA test; As and pH in TCLP leachate and mine drainage, particle size, trace and major elements in tailings, were analyzed using the relevant methodologies. The ABA results which indicated a high tendency for acid generation were interpreted using a four data point model developed for the purpose. The model allows an additional 40 kg CaCO3/ton amendment value to take care of any delayed acidification. Arsenic leaching simulations are described by the equation: [As] . With the y-axis set to zero, pH simulation equations are defined by pH = K, where the K and pH values ranging from 82 to 100 and 4.1 to 9.0 respectively, represent limits within which natural attenuation of As in drainage can be sustained. Expressing the pH equation above in the form, pH = (ln |R-2| - lnK), the simulation equations defined the range 2.2-4.6 which conformed to pH range for which secondary minerals such as jarosite, schwertmannite and ferrihydrite, could occur as buffering agents in mine drainage. Also, molar value plot for Fe2O3 against Al2O3 indicate the precipitation of goethite and alunite into tailings, while increased fines and As enrichment in older tailings confirmed As attenuation. Such information is relevant for front-end planning for As impact remediation in mine drainage.",
1457,"Spectral technique for detection of changes in eggshells caused by Mycoplasma synoviae Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) is a major pathogen in chicken and turkeys, causing subclinical infection. MS infections are highly prevalent and may potentate and be involved in sinovitis, respiratory syndromes, as well as lead to eggshell apex abnormality (EAA). A deformed, inhomogeneous eggshell is susceptible to cracks and breaks through which microbes get in and additionally entails higher water loss in the egg during the entire incubation process. Not all eggs with eggshell apex abnormality possess characteristic deformation and that is why some eggs may be incorrectly classified during a visual inspection. To minimize the above risk, the spectral VIS technique and the analysis based on the classification tree method-CTM is proposed. The method makes use of specially defined parameters extracted from the shape of transmittance spectra of eggshells. Directional coefficients of the lines adjusted to the specific ranges of the transmittance spectrum are used in the process of classifying samples as those from MS-carrying hens and from healthy hens. Three CTM-based classifiers were created for a group of white, brown, and mixed shells. After comparing, it can be concluded that the best results were obtained for the group of brown shells (accuracy 88%, specificity 88%, and false negative rate 13%). The authors present a non-invasive spectral method that utilizes eggshells, i.e., the natural waste from chicken farms. The method enables entering data into the classifiers described in the article. The process provides an opportunity to correctly assign, the examined shell to the group of shells with increased risk-with approx. 86% accuracy. This means that, if a few of such results are registered, the herd is eligible more specific studies targeting MS bacteria. Regular spectral testing can support the detection of egg lesions in MS positive flocks.",
1458,"Magmatic stratigraphy in the Bushveld Northern Lobe: continuous geophysical and mineralogical data from the 2950 m Bellevue drillcore We present a large database of geophysical, petrological and mineralogical measurements for the similar to 3000 m Bellevue borehole through the entire Upper Zone (UZ) and about half of the Main Zone (MZ) of the Northern Lobe of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa. Magnetic susceptibilty readings were taken every 2 cm (n = 109,360) and densities were measured on average every 1.7 m (n = 2252). Petrographic data and microprobe analyses (n = 14,160) were obtained for plagioclase, mafic silicates, Fe-Ti oxides, amphibole and biotite in 502 samples throughout the entire sequence of layered mafic cumulates, The Bellevue UZ, as marked by the first appearance of cumulus magnetite, is similar to 1190 m thick (corrected for mean clip of 17.5 degrees), which is less than UZ thicknesses in the Eastern and Western Lobes. A prominent 4 m thick pyroxenite horizon occurs similar to 390 in below the UZ-MZ boundary, but we show, on the basis of mineralogy that this horizon cannot be correlated with the well known Pyroxenite Marker (PM) of the Eastern and Western Bushveld Complex. if the PM is indeed absent in the Northern Lobe, then a substantial portion, perhaps 500 m of the uppermost MZ may be missing; possible causes include non-deposition (e.g. due to syn-magmatic upwarping or diapirism) or removal (e.g. due to emplacement of UZ magmas). The Bellevue drillcore penetrated only about half of the MZ (total dip-corrected thickness similar to 1270 m), and the lowermost similar to 200 m contains unusual olivine-bearing (or troctolitic) horizons that are atypical of MZ rocks elsewhere in the Bushveld Complex. These troctolites have mineral compositions as primitive as those of the upper Critical Zone (CZ), suggesting that they might represent a sliver of CZ rocks dismembered by intrusion of MZ magmas. Alternatively, they may represent an intrusive sill of syn- or post-Bushveld age, or merely a mineralogically unusual horizon in otherwise typical MZ lithologies. Mineral compositions show broad normal fractionation upwards, with plagioclase An 78 -> 21, opx (and inverted pigeonite) En 80 -> 26, cpx Mg 86 -> 27, olivine Fo 78 -> 74 (in the lowermost troctolitic horizon) and Fo 59 -> 06 (in the UZ olivine ferrodiorites). There are, however, numerous prominent reversals and discontinuities in mineral compositions, some of which are likely related to magma additions. The extensive dataset of mineral compositions allows the estimation of a new fractionation trend for the Bushveld Complex. On an En-An diagram, the Bushveld trend is shifted toward more An-rich plagioclase at equivalent Mg# of coexisting pyroxenes relative to those for Kiglapait or Skaergaard. This is attributed to the relative paucity in Bushveld of augite, which has a high fractionating power for Ca/Na in evolving liquids. Magnetic susceptibility data clearly reveal the presence of the UZ-MZ boundary. MZ cumulates have susceptibilty values < 0.05 SI units, and generally < 0.02 SI units. Above the UZ-MZ boundary, susceptibilty varies enormously, from anorthosites (< 0.1 SI units) to magnetitites (to almost 5 SI units), and there is excellent correlation between susceptibility and lithology, in many cases to a resolution of < 5 to 10 cm. Anorthositic rocks, especially in the MZ, commonly show higher susceptibilty than surrounding polyphase cumulates, due to intercumulus and/or dust-like inclusions of magnetite. Density data reveal surprising cyclicity in the Main Zone on the scale of 50 to 200 m, with progressively increasing density upwards in individual layered units, reflecting gradual increase in modal colour index from 0 to 10% to 50 to 60%. In some cases the upward density increases are correlated with broad reversals in chemical fractionation trends (e.g. upward increases in Mg# of pyroxenes), arguing against simple fractionation. Vie suggest that such layers may represent blending zones in which dense liquids and/or crystals from new magma additions drain downwards into the existing cumulate pile. MZ cumulates, therefore, may have been constructed",
1459,"MODELS OF WATER MARKET MECHANISMS AND AN ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION TO THE MIDDLE-EAST The growing demand by countries in the eastern Mediterranean over the waters of the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers, and the highly depleted coastal and mountain groundwater reservoirs, raise the need to explore ways and means to ameliorate existing and expected water scarcity. Economists have for some time proposed ways towards more efficient exploitation of existing water supplies, specifically by employing market incentive mechanisms in order to encourage voluntary water sharing among countries and regions. Such trading schemes may involve two or more countries. It can be shown that such schemes - given any initial assignment of property claims to water resources - can often lead to increases in the welfare of the countries concerned. The paper proposes two specific mechanisms for international markets in water claims in the eastern Mediterranean region, in which parties voluntarily engage in such trades, as they would expect to gain real benefits from these transactions. Simulation exercises with real data show that - as is true for any opening of markets to international trade - that all parties in the region might benefit to a greater or lesser degree from auctions of water claims, either from actually using imported water or from the monetary gain from water exports.",
1460,"Water quality changes in response to urban expansion: spatially varying relations and determinants Urban expansion is an important stressor to water bodies, and the spatial variations of their relations are increasingly highlighted by recent studies. What remain unclear, however, are the underlying drivers to the spatial variability. The paper was not limited to modeling spatially varying linkages but also drew attention to the local anthropogenic influential factors that shape land-water relations. We employed geographically weighted regression to examine the relationships between urban expansion (measured by land use change intensity) and water quality changes (focusing on six water quality indicators) in a recently fast-growing Chinese city, Lianyungang. Specifically, we analyzed how the local characteristics including urbanization level, environmental management, industrial zone expansion, and land use composition, attributed to the varying responses of water quality changes. Results showed that urbanization level significantly affects land-water linkages. Remarkable water quality improvement was accompanied by urbanization in highly developed watersheds, primarily due to strong influence from extensive water management practices (particularly for COD, BOD, NH3-N, and TP). By contrast, water qualities of less-urbanized watersheds were more sensitive and negatively responsive to land use changes. Clustering industrial activities acted as distinct contributor to Hg contamination, while boosted organic pollution control in highly urbanized areas. The approach proposed in the study can locate and further zoom into the hot-spots of human-water interactions, thereby contributing to better solutions for mitigating undesirable impacts of urbanization on water environment.",
1461,"Contribution of Rainfall on Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting and Saving on the Slopes of Mt. Elgon, East Africa Despite the achievements reported from using rainwater harvesting systems, the contribution and drawbacks that affect their usage in mountainous landscapes have received little attention. The uptake and usage of domestic rooftop rainwater harvesting systems (RRWHS) in developing countries is on the increase due to increasing water scarcities. We explored the effect of rainfall variability on water supply and the downsides of using the systems by rural households in Uganda. The objectives were to assess the variability of rainfall (1985-2018), categorise RRWHS used, and examine the influence of slope ranges on the placement of systems and also to quantify the harvested and saved rainwater and establish the factors that affected system usage. Rainfall variability was assessed using a Mann-Kendall test, while system contributions and drawbacks were examined using socioeconomic data. A representative of 444 households were selected using a multicluster sampling procedure and interviewed using semistructured questionnaires. Findings revealed that the months of March, April, September, August, and October experienced an upward trend of rainfall with a monthly coefficient of variation between 41 and 126%. With this, households responded by employing fixed (reinforced concrete tanks, corrugated iron tanks, and plastic tanks) and mobile RRWHS (saucepans, metallic drums/plastic drums, jerrycans, and clay pots). At the high altitude, households deployed mostly plastic jerrycans and industrial plastic/metallic drums to harvest and save water. Overall, the mean annual volume of rainwater harvested on the slopes of Mt. Elgon was 163,063â€‰m(3)/yr, while the potential to save water ranged from 4% to 7% of the annual household water demand. The factors that hindered the deployment of RRWHS to harvest and save water were high operational costs, price fluctuations, unreliable rainfall pattern, inadequate funds, and limited accessibility. The rainfall received if well-harvested and saved can redeem households of water insecurity, though there is an urgent need of subsidies from the government to increase accessibility of the systems.",
1462,"Influence of agricultural, industrial, and anthropogenic stresses on the distribution and diversity of macroinvertebrates in Juru River Basin, Penang, Malaysia Abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates as well as physico-chemical parameters were investigated in five rivers of the Juru River Basin in northern Peninsula Malaysia: Ceruk Tok Kun River (CTKR), Pasir River (PR), Permatang Rawa River (PRR), Kilang Ubi River (KUR), and Juru River OR). The physico-chemical parameters and calculated water quality index (WQI) were significantly different among the investigated rivers (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The WQI classified CTKR, PR, and JR into class III (slightly polluted). However, PRR and KUR fell into class IV (polluted). High diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates, especially the intolerant taxa, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, were observed in the least polluted river, CTKR. Decreasing abundance of macroinvertebrates followed the deterioration of river water quality with the least number of the most tolerant taxa collected from PR. On the basis of composition and sensitivity of macroinvertebrates to pollutants in each river, the highest Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) index score of 93 was reported in CTKR (good water quality). BMWP scores in PRR and JR were 38.7 and 20.1, respectively, classifying both of them into ""moderate water quality"" category. Poor water quality was reported in PR and KUR. The outcome of the multivariate analysis (CCA) was highly satisfactory, explaining 43.32% of the variance for the assemblages of macroinvertebrates as influenced by 19 physical and chemical variables. According to the CCA model, we assert that there were three levels of stresses on macroinvertebrate communities in the investigated rivers: Level 1, characterized of undisturbed or slightly polluted as in the case of CTKR; Level 2, characterized by a lower habitat quality (the JR) compared to the CTKR; and Level 3 showed severe environmental stresses (PRR, PR, and KUR) primarily contributed by agricultural, industrial, and municipal discharges.

1463,"Mesoscale Eddy Effects on the Subduction of North Pacific Eastern Subtropical Mode Water The effects of mesoscale eddies on the subduction of the North Pacific eastern subtropical mode water (ESTMW) are studied by comparing observations with results from the Ocean Model for the Earth Simulator (OFES). Both observations and the OFES show that mesoscale eddies exist in the ESTMW subduction region. Compared to the observations, the OFES reproduces the characteristics of the ESTMW and subduction quite well. Subduction of the ESTMW mainly occurs within a low-density advection region, which leads to the formation of low potential vorticity water. The eddy subduction rate accounts for nearly 56% of the total subduction rate, creating high peaks in the ESTMW subduction volume histogram. Case study results show that the propagation of eddies is responsible for the shallowing of the mixed-layer depth, which allows low potential vorticity water to subduct under the mixed-layer bottom and prevents it from being entrained back into the mixed layer. The eddy subduction process investigated here has important implications for the further study of ESTMW subduction and transport, which is helpful for better understanding the interior transportation between the tropics and subtropics.",
1464,"Drinking water supply in mega cities: The example of Kolkata/Calcutta, India The consumption of contaminated drinking water is still one of the most important health hazards in developing countries - even in urban areas. Calcutta, once famous as the ""cholera capital"" of the world, still faces problems related to bacteriological water contamination (the most recent outbreak of Cholera was in November 2000), but high levels of heavy metal contamination (particularly As, but also Pb and Ni), which originate from industrial but also natural sources, are also found at an alarming frequency. At the same time, public awareness of these problems is rather minimal; even through many people consider Calcutta's drinking water contaminated, they tend to be misinformed about the nature of contaminants and ways of protecting themselves.",1
1465,"Toxicological and ecotoxicological pressure due to pesticide use in Sancti Spiritus, Cuba Aim of study: To quantify the toxicity and ecotoxicological pressure of pesticides in Sancti Spiritus province, Cuba, between 2011 and 2014. Material and methods: A longitudinal descriptive study was designed for the study period, to identify potential risks to the environment and human health associated with the use of pesticides. In order to determine the toxicity and ecotoxicity of pesticide use, Sigma Seq (Spread equivalents), POCER (Pesticide Occupational and Environmental Risk) indicator, and the Toxic Load (TL) methodology of the Plant Health Cuban Institute were used. Main results: Corresponding to 62 chemical families, 124 active ingredients were applied in the province during the study period. Organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, inorganic compounds (such as copper), dithiocarbamates, aryloxyphenoxypropionates, neonicotinoids, sulfonylurea, triazoles, and organochlorines predominated due to their frequency of use. Use of toxic-pesticides, lack of personal protection equipment amount others made workers, residents and applicators the toxicological modules with the highest risk of exposure. From the POCER results we found that aquatic organisms, persistence, and groundwater are the modules with the highest ecotoxicological pressure. Research highlights: With the use of the POCER indicator as well as Sigma Seq, a more accurate assessment of toxicity and ecotoxicity from certain pesticide can be done instead of the TL equation currently used in Cuba. In addition substitution of the most toxic pesticides by less toxic ones could help to reduce synthetic pesticide pressure on humans and the environment. This study can help to develop policies and management practices to reduce the hazards of synthetic pesticide use in Cuba.",
1466,"Trends and probabilistic stability index for evaluating groundwater quality: The case of quaternary alluvial and quartzite aquifer system of India This study proposed a novel groundwater-quality stability index (GQSI), which considers probabilistic estimate of reliability and resilience based on multi-year dataset. The developed index is validated and optimized adopting optimum index factor approach. The vulnerabilities of different groundwater quality parameters are also computed to provide an insight about the deviations of their concentrations from the safe drinking water limits. The application of the developed stability index is demonstrated through a case study in quaternary alluvial and quartzite aquifer system of India. In addition, trends in the groundwater quality parameters are identified by using variance-corrected Mann-Kendall test, and trends are quantified by using Sen's slope estimation test. Box-whisker plots revealed that EC and TDS mostly exceed their maximum permissible limits prescribed for drinking water in the southern and southwest hard-rock formations. Whereas, most parameters do not cross their maximum desirable limits in the central and northern alluvial formations. Increasing trends of potassium and bicarbonate, and decreasing trends of carbonate, calcium, sulfate, and fluoride are found prominent. The GQSI values indicated high stability of groundwater quality under older alluvium geology and low stability under the gneiss and mica-schist. Results of the GQSI are found in agreement with that of groundwater-quality index (GQI) at 84% sites, which proved adequacy of the developed GQSI. Also, three classes ('low'/'poor', 'moderate', and 'high'/'good') of both the GQSI and GQI showed a good coherence at 83, 78, and 87% sites. However, GQSI is more advantageous than GQI due to former's statistical framework, consistency and comparability over different areas. Three optimum index factors, i.e., TDS, pH and nitrate, are found to have the maximum impact on overall groundwater quality with their largest variations. Results of the optimum groundwater-quality stability index (OGQSI) and GQSI closely matched with each other, and a significant linear relationship (R(2)â€¯=â€¯0.70) existed between them. Therefore, OGQSI is a cost-effective approach for adequate monitoring and satisfactory evaluation of the groundwater quality in low-income nations.",
1467,"Integrated assessment of groundwater resources in the Oueme basin, Benin, West Africa An integrated assessment of groundwater resources in Benin, West Africa was performed within the framework of the EC-funded research project RIVERTWIN (www.rivertwin.org). The assessment included a spatial analysis of groundwater relevant parameters taken from more than 4000 wells stored in a countrywide water database (BDI - Banque des Donnees Integree) and an estimation of the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater recharge using a modified version of the hydrological model HBV. Additionally, a socio-economic assessment of the impacts of groundwater availability and accessibility on national health issues as well as an assessment of groundwater development costs was carried out. The analysis revealed particularly unfavourable conditions for groundwater use in the northern part of the country where groundwater recharge during the wet season does not lead to the formation of persistent groundwater storage in its shallow, unconfined aquifers. Poor storage capacity and hydraulic properties of the deeper fractured aquifers additionally limit the capacity of individual wells to capture groundwater recharge. Including climate change scenarios forecasting less precipitation (generated from global climate models (GCM) based on IPCC scenarios) indicates that the situation in water scarce regions will worsen, as recharge volumes lessen and occur over a shorter time period. Drilling more wells may be a limited option to capture larger portions of the recharge, since the capture zone and therefore the regional influence of existing wells is rather small. In the south, deeper confined aquifers guarantee better and more reliable yields, yet the lack of long-term monitoring and groundwater age data does not allow an appraisal of the limits of the sustainable use of these aquifers. Finally, it has been shown that access to suitable aquifers and diarrhea prevalence are spatially correlated. Access to groundwater is thereby not only a function of aquifer suitability and groundwater availability but a function of well development (mainly drilling) costs as well. The present study can be seen as a first attempt of an integrated evaluation of the groundwater resources and the development options based on the BDI data set. However, it can clearly be seen that the amount, nature and reliability of the data currently available is not sufficient to come to a clear, spatially explicit description of groundwater resources in the country. Improved monitoring and the use of advanced data collection methods (isotopic analysis, remote sensing, fully coupled models of the hydrological cycle) are required to improve the understanding Benin's groundwater resources.

1468,"Influence of the Amazon Hydrological Regime on Eutrophication Indicators of a Hydroelectric Power Plant Reservoir Dam constructions in the Amazon have increased exponentially in the last decades, causing several environmental impacts and serious anthropogenic impacts in certain hydroelectric power plant reservoirs in the region have been identified. The assessment of the trophic status of these reservoirs is of interest to indicate man-made changes in the environment, but must take into account the hydrological cycle of the area. This can be relevant for environmental management actions, aiding in the identification of the ecological status of water bodies. In this context, physico-chemical parameters and eutrophication indicators were determined in a hydroelectric power plant reservoir in the Brazilian Amazon to assess trophic variations during the regional hydrological regime phases on the reservoir, namely dry, filling, full and emptying stages. The local hydrological regimes were shown to significantly influence TSS and turbidity, as well as NH(4), NO(3), PO(4), with higher values consistently observed during the filling stage of the reservoir. In addition, differences among the sampling stations regarding land use, population and anthropogenic activities were reflected in the PO(4)(3-) values during the different hydrological phases.",
1469,"Haloacetic acid-degrading bacterial communities in drinking water systems as determined by cultivation and by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of PCR-amplified haloacid dehalogenase gene fragments AIMS: To characterize the HAA-degrading bacteria in drinking water systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: Haloacetic acid (HAA)-degrading bacteria were analysed in drinking water systems by cultivation and by a novel application of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP). Substantial similarities were observed among the tRFLP patterns of dehI and dehII gene fragments in drinking water samples obtained from three different cities (Minneapolis, MN; St Paul, MN; Bucharest, Romania) and from one biologically active granular activated carbon filter (Hershey, PA). The dominant fragment in the tRFLP profiles of dehI genes from the drinking water samples matched the pattern from an Afipia sp. that was previously isolated from drinking water. In contrast, the dominant fragment in the tRFLP profiles of dehII genes did not match any previously characterized dehII gene fragment. PCR cloning was used to characterize this gene fragment, which had <65% nucleotide sequence identity with any previously characterized dehII gene. CONCLUSIONS: Afipia spp. are an appropriate model organism for studying the biodegradation of HAAs in drinking water distribution systems as encoded by dehI genes; the organism that harbours the most prominent dehII gene in drinking water has yet to be cultivated and identified. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The development of a novel application of tRFLP targeting dehI and dehII genes could be broadly useful in understanding HAA-degrading bacteria in numerous environments.",
1470,"Drinking water salinity is associated with hypertension and hyperdilute urine among Daasanach pastoralists in Northern Kenya Water salinity is a growing global environmental health concern. However, little is known about the relation between water salinity and chronic health outcomes in non-coastal, lean populations. Daasanach pastoralists living in northern Kenya traditionally rely on milk, yet are experiencing socioecological changes and have expressed concerns about the saltiness of their drinking water. Therefore, this cross-sectional study conducted water quality analyses to examine how water salinity, along with lifestyle factors like milk intake, was associated with hypertension (blood pressure BP â‰¥140Â mmÂ Hg systolic or â‰¥90Â mmÂ Hg diastolic) and hyperdilute urine (urine specific gravity <1.003Â g/mL, indicative of altered kidney function). We collected health biomarkers and survey data from 226 non-pregnant adults (46.9% male) aged 18+ from 134 households in 2019 along with participant observations in 2020. The salinity (total concentration of all dissolved salts) of reported drinking water from hand-dug wells in dry river beds, boreholes, and a pond ranged from 120 to 520Â mg/L. Water from Lake Turkana and standpipes, which was only periodically used for consumption when no other drinking sources are available, ranged from 1100 to 2300Â mg/L. Multiple logistic regression models with standard errors clustered on households indicate that each additional 100Â mg/L of drinking water salinity was associated with 45% (95% CI: 1.09-1.93, PÂ =Â 0.010) increased odds of hypertension and 33% (95% CI: 0.97-1.83, PÂ =Â 0.075) increased odds of hyperdilute urine adjusted for confounders. Results were robust to multiple specifications of the models and sensitivity analyses. Daily milk consumption was associated with 61-63% (PÂ <Â 0.01) lower odds of both outcomes. This considerable protective effect of milk intake may be due to the high potassium, magnesium, and calcium contents or the protective lifestyle considerations of moving with livestock. Our study results demonstrate that drinking water salinity may have critical health implications for blood pressure and kidney function even among lean, active pastoralists.",
1471,"Powering an island system by renewable energy-A feasibility analysis in the Maldives Water and energy supply systems are essential parts of the infrastructure on islands. For small islands that are far from continents, water shortage is usually the main constraint on economic and social development. In order to maintain island water security, desalination plants are built to supply fresh water. The plants need a great deal of energy, which increases demand for energy and the cost of transportation. Thus, it is necessary to design a new island system driven by renewable energy. This study investigated the existing type of water and energy supply systems in some typical islands of the world, and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. The energy supply systems can be classified into three categories: imported conventional energy supply system (ICESS); imported conventional energy & renewable energy supply system (ICE & RESS); and integrated energy supply system (IESS). Water supply systems can also be classified into three categories: imported water supply system (ImWSS); imported water and unconventional water supply system (IW & UWSS); and integrated water supply system (InWSS). The nexus of energy and water is very complicated on islands. This paper presents a framework for an interconnected energy and water system on an island. The new framework reveals a roadmap from ""full input of energy & water (FIEW)"" through ""semi-input of energy & water (SIEW)"" to ""zero input of energy & water (ZIEW)"", which leads an island's energy and water resources to become gradually independent from the mainland. The new framework also reduces transportation costs and carbon emissions. The proposed framework is applied to the Maldives to aid design of a renewable energy-driven water supply system. The characteristics and mutual adaptability of three types of renewable energy (solar, wind, and biomass energy) and water supply systems is discussed. The results show that a ZIEW system can be realized in the Maldives with a reduction in the cost of renewable energy. ZIEW system has great potential for application in island regions in the future.",
1472,"Facile synthesis of beta-FeOOH nanoparticle-loaded secondary fly ash composites for enhanced removal of copper ion Based on the ""treating wastewater with wastes"" strategy, an acid-dissolved fly ash residue derived from the extracting aluminum industry (denoted as secondary fly ash (SFA)) was chosen as very cheap and suitable solid support to be modified as an adsorbent for the removal of Cu2+ from wastewater in this article. A facile liquid-phase deposition method was introduced to achieve the loading of active beta-FeOOH nanoparticles on the SFA surface wherein the gelatin was added to regulate microstructure and dispersity of the nanoparticles. The texture and composition of products were characterized using various techniques such as FE-SEM, XRF, X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption/desorption, and 27 Al MAS NMR. Results of batch adsorption experiments showed that SFA-Fe exhibited an obviously enhanced adsorption performance than the raw one. The optimal adsorption of Cu2+ was achieved at pH 5.5, and high temperature was beneficial to the adsorption with an increasing adsorption capacity (12.59-14.91 mg g(-1)) as environment temperatures rise from 298.15 to 318.15 K. The experimental data were determined to be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm model. Furthermore, thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption process of Cu2+ by SFA-Fe is endothermic and spontaneous. In addition, the electrostatic interactions and proton exchange are manifested to be the two main mechanisms for Cu2+ adsorption. This investigation not only provides a utilization approach of the SFA but also fabricates a potential and low-cost adsorbent for treatment of Cu2+ contamination.",
1473,"Arsenic in drinking water - Problems and solutions The current United States maximum contaminant level for arsenic in drinking water is set at 50 mu g/l. Because of the cancer risks involved, Canada has already lowered the maximum contaminant level to 25 mu g/l; the United States Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the current allowable level for arsenic with a view of lowering it significantly. Various treatment methods have been adopted to remove arsenic from drinking water. These methods include 1) adsorption-coprecipitation using iron and aluminum salts, 2) adsorption on activated alumina, activated carbon, and activated bauxite, 3) reverse osmosis, 4) ion exchange and 5) oxidation followed by filtration. Because of the promise of oxidation-filtration systems, column studies were conducted at the University of Regina to examine oxidation with KMnO4 followed by filtration using manganese greensand and iron-oxide coated sand to examine the removal of arsenic from drinking water; these results were compared with the data from ion exchange studies. These studies demonstrated that As (III) could be reduced from 200 mu g/l to below 25 mu g/l by the manganese greensand system. In the case of manganese greensand filtration, addition of iron in the ratio of 20:1 was found necessary to achieve this removal. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ.

1474,"Characteristics of organic matter removed from highly saline mature landfill leachate by an emergency disk tube-reverse osmosis treatment system Some sanitary landfills in China are required to treat aging landfill leachate that is highly saline. In this study, the effectiveness of an emergency disk tube-reverse osmosis (DTRO) treatment system for such a refractory mature landfill leachate was evaluated. A molecular-level analysis was then applied to reveal the changes of the characteristics of leachate organic matter (OM). The DTRO system achieved >83% water recovery rate, reduced the electrical conductivity of effluent to 0.15-0.22Â ms/cm, and reduced carbonaceous and nitrogenous pollutants to a level suitable for discharge. Furthermore, the vast majority of salts (e.g., chloride and sulfate ions), as well as refractory OM (e.g., humic- and fulvic-like substances), were effectively removed. The DTRO system can effectively remove a large number of macromolecular dissolved organic compounds with carbon number >23, as well as highly unsaturated compounds with DBE >12. Additionally, > 80% of the molecules assigned to the dissolved OM (DOM) were removed; even CHONS compounds with complex molecular structures were completely removed. The constitution of DOM in the DTRO effluent was simple, mainly comprising anti-sludge agents (e.g., small molecule alcohol and alkyl benzene sulfonic acid, etc.). However, the DOM in the resulting membrane concentrates was very similar to that in raw landfill leachate and the concentration was much higher. Therefore, an effective and feasible method should be developed to treat DTRO membrane concentrates because they pose high environmental risk.",
1475,"Efficacy of Boric Acid as a Treatment of Choice for Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media and Its Ototoxicity Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is one of the most common chronic infectious diseases worldwide, especially affecting children. The patients or the parents of the affected children are often worried about the cost of medical visits, prescription medicines, or inconsistently effective medication. The complications of CSOM have been greatly reduced because of the development of antibiotics; however, the irrational use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of organisms resistant to the commonly used drugs. Owing to the increase in antibiotic resistance, the development of new treatments that will efficiently eradicate infectious microorganisms has become imperative. Boric acid solutions are effective in the treatment of CSOM because of their acidic effect. Various databases, such as the PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and SciELO, were searched for references related to the efficacy of boric acid in the treatment of mucosal CSOM, as well as its ototoxicity. The search revealed that boric acid is relatively effective in treating CSOM, especially at a high concentration. Boric acid in distilled water was found safe in animal studies. However, the ototoxicity of boric acid concentrations higher than 4% needs further evaluation, considering the effectivity of boric acid at high concentrations.",
1476,"Low-mineral direct drinking water in school may retard height growth and increase dental caries in schoolchildren in China Although direct drinking water (DDW) systems that utilize a reverse-osmosis technique are thought to be harmful to children's development by reducing their daily mineral intake, few population data are available regarding this topic. We conducted an eco-epidemiological study to investigate the influence of low-mineral DDW on the development of schoolchildren. We collected developmental parameters of 13,723 girls and 16,161 boys before and after the introduction of DDW systems in 25 schools and measured the mineral levels in the DDW of each school. The DDW in 22 schools had lower-than-recommended levels of magnesium and calcium (magnesium, 10â€¯mg/L and calcium, 20â€¯mg/L, WHO). We found that children exposed to low-mineral DDW exhibited reduced height and diminished height increases as well as higher prevalences and incidences of hypoevolutism and dental caries (pâ€¯<â€¯0.01). This exposure was a risk factor for a greater incidence of both hypoevolutism and dental caries in children (RRâ€¯=â€¯7.110 (1.688, 29.953) and 1.813 (1.309, 2.509), respectively; pâ€¯<â€¯0.01). Our results suggest that low-mineral DDW may retard height growth and promote the incidence of dental caries in schoolchildren; thus, schools should choose DDW treatment systems that retain the minerals in water.",
1477,"Effects of environmental and spatial factors on the distribution of anuran species with aquatic reproduction in central Amazonia We evaluated the effect of environmental and spatial variables on the distribution of 11 species of anurans in 10,000 ha of non-flooded forest in central Amazonia. Diurnal and nocturnal frog assemblages were sampled in 72 plots using visual and auditory surveys. Distance from stream was the best predictor for species richness and abundance, with an increase in distance resulting in a decrease in number of species and individuals. Three species (Osteocephalus oophagus, Trachycephalus resinifictrix and Vitreorana oyampiensis) were not influenced by environmental predictors and occurred along all environmental gradients. The watersheds did not influence the abundance of the majority of species except Allobates sp., Atelopus spumarius and Leptodactylus rhodomystax. Our results indicate that most species studied occur along the margins of streams, which they also use as dispersal corridors. The removal of forests near streams could lead to local extinctions.",
1478,"[Nitrate pollution in groundwater for drinking and its affecting factors in Hailun, northeast China] Nitrate pollution in groundwater has become a worldwide problem. It may affect the water quality for daily use and thus the health of people. The temporal and spatial characteristics of nitrate pollution in the groundwater were addressed by sample analysis of the drinkable water from 157 wells in Hailun, Heilongjiang, northeastern China. It was found that the mean value of nitrate concentration in all wells was 14.01 mg x L(-1). Of all the samples, the nitrate concentrations of 26.11% wells exceeded the standard of drinkable water (10.00 mg x L(-1)). A significant difference was found on the spatial distribution of nitrate pollution in the study area. The pollution degree in term of nitrate pollution was in the order: the central rolling hills and flooding plain > the northeastern mountain area > the southwest rolling hills and plain. Based on the results, the factors causing the pollution we analyzed from the well properties and pollution sources. As for well properties, the type of the pipe material plays a critical role in the groundwater nitrate pollution. It was found that the wells with seamless pipe have less pollution than those with multiple-sections pipe. The concentrations of seamless pipe wells and multiple ones were respectively 5.08 mg x L(-1) and 32.57 mg x L(-1), 12.26% and 82.35% of these two kinds wells exceeded 10.00 mg x L(-1), the state drinking water standard. In the whole Hailun, there is no statistically relationship between nitrate-N levels of wells and the well depth. However, a statistically lower nitrate-N was observed in the deep wells than that in the shallower ones. The mean values of nitrate concentration of the seamless-pipe deep wells, seamless-pipe shallow wells, multiple-section-pipe deep wells and multiple-section-pipe shallow wells were 1.84, 12.02, 25.14 and 45.61 mg x L(-1). Analysis of pollution source shows that the heavily polluted regions are usually associated with large use of nitrogen fertilizer and household livestock or poultry. This indicates a positive correlation between the nitrate-N pollution of groundwater and the nitrogen fertilizer, household livestock, poultry.",
1479,"Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the biosorption of Cr (VI) in aqueous solutions by Agaricus campestris In the present study, biomass of Agaricus campestris was tested to evaluate its effectivity as a biosorbent for the removal of Cr (VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The influence of various process parameters such as pH, temperature, contact time, biosorbent dosage and desorption were studied. Pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Ritchies and intraparticle diffusion model were used to present the adsorption kinetics. Results obtained indicate that the adsorption process is fast and spontaneous within the first 60 min. The experimental data supports pseudo-second order model. The sorption data conformed well to the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) onto A. campestris was 56.21 mg g(-1) for Cr(VI) at 45 degrees C when 0.1 g biomass was used. In addition, the mean values of thermodynamic parameters of standard free energy (Delta G(0) = -1.635 kJ mol(-1) at 45 degrees C), standard enthalpy (Delta H-0 = -9.582 kJ mol(-1)) and standard entropy (Delta S-0 = -24.992 J mol(-1)K(-1)) of the adsorption mechanism were determined.",
1480,"Occurrence and formation of halobenzoquinones in indoor and outdoor swimming pool waters of Nanning City, Southwest China Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in swimming pool have elicited increasing worldwide concern due to their potential health risks. However, only trihalomethanes (THMs) are regulated by several local governing bodies. Studies indicated that specific unregulated DBP classes would drive disinfected water toxicity in addition to THMs. Halobenzoquinones (HBQs), a type of emerging unregulated DBPs, have been shown to be possible bladder cancer carcinogens. This study aimed to determine the distribution and formation of HBQs in indoor and outdoor swimming pool waters of Nanning City, Southwest China. Seven HBQs in water from seven public indoor and outdoor swimming pools were examined using an effective ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results suggest the presence of 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone in all the swimming pool waters in the range of 4.56-45.30Â ng/L. Furthermore, 2,6-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone and 3,4,5,6-tetrachloro-1,2-benzoquinone (TetraC-1,2-BQ) were detected in two pools at concentrations of <â€‰0.38-14.20 and <â€‰0.54-2.60Â ng/L, respectively. The swimming pool water featured higher HBQs than input tap water, and TetraC-1,2-BQ was only detected in pool water. Higher HBQ levels were observed in the indoor pools than in the outdoor pools. These findings demonstrate that low NH(3)-N, high chloride, humic acid, chemical oxygen demand, and UV(254) in the indoor pools increased the HBQ formation. This study is the first to reveal the occurrence and formation of HBQs in water from Chinese indoor and outdoor swimming pools. The findings should be useful in the management of these governing factors and HBQ controls in swimming pools.",
1481,"The Urban Poor, the Informal Sector and Environmental Health Policy in Nigeria Poverty and rapid urbanization are two of the mayor challenges facing Africa today. One of the primary concerns of the Millennium Development Goals of the UN-Habitat is to improve the lives of millions of slum dwellers around the world and to reduce the number of people without sustainable access to good drinking water and sanitation. This chapter examines how urban poverty and urban life-worlds have developed in Nigeria and other African countries over the last fifty years, the extent to which government policies have helped or constrained cities and the urban poor, and how poverty leading to slum conditions can be alleviated and reversed in order to reduce social tensions and worsening disparities in access to basic urban services. Some African governments have adopted a misguided policy of blaming the victims, trying in vain to repress and outlaw the informal sector by forcibly evicting hundreds of thousands of so-called squatters from urban slums. Current research suggests that the path to urban sustainability in Africa lies in building more inclusive and socially equitable cities. The central argument here is that human development and welfare ought to be at the centre of the concern for sustainable urbanization in Africa, and that greater priority should be given to the health and development concerns of the poor. The chapter concludes with some general reflections on the future of African cities, what form they will take, and how the changes needed to make these cities healthier, more productive, inclusive and equitable, as well as better able to meet people's needs, can be brought about.",
1482,"Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Awareness in Rural Bangladesh Safe drinking water and sanitation are closely related to the environmental and health risks faced by villagers in the rural areas of Bangladesh where tube-well arsenic contamination is an issue of particular concern. Since a significant percentage of the people affected by this problem have poor access to safe drinking water, the risk of increasing numbers of people suffering from arsenicosis is considered to be high. Regarding access to sanitation facilities, while the coverage ratio of improved facilities is increasing, improper management of existing facilities is often observed in rural areas. In this chapter, the authors conducted questionnaire surveys related to safe drinking water and sanitation awareness in two rural Bangladeshi villages with differing socio-environments. Based on the results of those surveys, the current status and local awareness levels of issues concerning drinking water and sanitation in their villages will be compared while taking socio-environmental differences into consideration. The authors will also discuss how the questionnaire survey results were used to help the villagers discuss alternatives that will improve their living environments and reduce health risks through the mitigation of arsenic contamination and sanitation improvements.",
1483,"Sustainable long-term intensive application of manure to sandy soils without phosphorus leaching: a case study from Ghana Long-term application of manure to sandy soils to ensure high crop productivity may lead to phosphorus (P) leaching, which, in turn, may deteriorate the quality of recipient waters because of eutrophication. The risk of P leaching depends on contents of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) oxides that are strong P sorbents and of calcium (Ca) that can form sparingly soluble Ca-P compounds. While P sorption by Al and Fe oxides is limited, the formation of sparingly soluble Ca-P may theoretically continue as long as enough Ca is available, i.e. under such conditions long-term application of manure may be environmentally sustainable. This hypothesis has been tested on soils formed on beach sand at Keta, Ghana, which have been used since the 1930s for intensive cultivation based on manure application. Soil samples were collected from different depths down to 80 cm in profile pits on cultivated soils that received manure over 70 years and on uncultivated plots (controls). The samples were analyzed for texture, pH, total C and P and poorly ordered Al and Fe oxides as well as different P forms as assessed by the Hedley fractionation method. The results showed a fourfold P increase in the top 40 cm of the cultivated soils, whereas in the deepest soil layers the P contents in the cultivated and uncultivated soils were almost the same indicating very limited downward P transport despite long-term manure application. This was supported by comparable P concentrations in groundwater taken under cultivated and uncultivated sites. P fractionation showed that the cultivated top soils were dominated by sparingly soluble Ca-P compounds that accounted for about 70% of the P gain. Thus, the results suggest that intensive crop production under tropical semi-arid conditions may be environmentally sustainable when based on manure fertilization ensuring enough Ca supply and neutral to alkaline pH.",
1484,"Assessment of soil erosion, flood risk and groundwater potential of Dhanari watershed using remote sensing and geographic information system, district Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand, India Quantitative morphometric analysis of Dhanari watershed has been done using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS). The impact of climate, lithology, tectonics, structural antecedents, vegetation cover and land use on hydrological processes is assessed by quantifying geomorphic parameters. The Dhanari River (a tributary of the Bhagirathi River) and its tributaries Dhanpati Gad and Kali Gad forms Dhanari watershed covering 91.8 -Km2 area. Several geomorphic aspects viz. linear, areal, relief were computed to comprehend potentials of soil erosion, groundwater, flood vulnerability and the geomorphic response of watershed. LISS-III image is used to generate the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map and assess the watershed dynamics. Values of computed hypsometric integral and morphometric parameters viz. drainage density (D-d), stream frequency (F-s), stream length ratio (L ur), bifurcation ratio (R-b), rho coefficient (.), drainage texture (D-t), circularity ratio (R-c), relief ratio (R hl), elongation ratio (R-e), form factor (F-f), basin shape (B-s), drainage intensity (D i), compactness coefficient (C-c) and infiltration number (I-f) have shown a moderate and steady erosion rate, with low groundwater potential and low to moderate flood vulnerability in the watershed. Hypsometry presents a dependable geomorphic parameter to understand the erosion and geomorphic response of a watershed to hydrological processes. Hypsometric integral value (0.51) of Dhanari watershed suggests a mature topography with steady erosion in the watershed.",
1485,"Estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from sewer pipeline system Purpose The aim of this study was to estimate the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated from whole life cycle stages of a sewer pipeline system and suggest the strategies to mitigate GHG emissions from the system. Methods The process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) with a city-scale inventory database of a sewer pipeline system was conducted. The GHG emissions (direct, indirect, and embodied) generated from a sewer pipeline system in Daejeon Metropolitan City (DMC), South Korea, were estimated for a case study. The potential improvement actions which can mitigate GHG emissions were evaluated through a scenario analysis based on a sensitivity analysis. Results and discussion The amount of GHG emissions varied with the size (150, 300, 450, 700, and 900 mm) and materials (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), concrete, and cast iron) of the pipeline. Pipes with smaller diameter emitted less GHG, and the concrete pipe generated lower amount of GHG than pipes made from other materials. The case study demonstrated that the operation (OP) stage (3.67 x 10(4) t CO(2)eq year(-1), 64.9%) is the most significant for total GHG emissions (5.65 x 10(4) t CO(2)eq year(-1)) because a huge amount of CH4 (3.51 x 10(4) t CO(2)eq year(-1)) can be generated at the stage due to biofilm reaction in the inner surface of pipeline. Mitigation of CH4 emissions by reducing hydraulic retention time (HRT), optimizing surface area-to-volume (A/V) ratio of pipes, and lowering biofilm reaction during the OP stage could be effective ways to reduce total GHG emissions from the sewer pipeline system. For the rehabilitation of sewer pipeline system in DMC, the use of small diameter pipe, combination of pipe materials, and periodic maintenance activities are suggested as suitable strategies that could mitigate GHG emissions. Conclusions This study demonstrated the usability and appropriateness of the process-based LCA providing effective GHG mitigation strategies at a city-scale sewer pipeline system. The results obtained from this study could be applied to the development of comprehensive models which can precisely estimate all GHG emissions generated from sewer pipeline and other urban environmental systems.",
1486,"Rooting and vegetative propagation in Laguncularia racemosa Reproduction and dispersal in mangrove species occurs mainly through propagules. Vegetative propagation is considered to be insignificant by many researchers, however, for restoration projects, it could be an important advantage. Therefore, we carried out experiments with shoot cuttings of Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle under controlled conditions as well as in the field to prove the feasibility of vegetative propagation in these mangrove species. None of 110 planted R. mangle cuttings survived the experiments, but the results with L. racemosa were promising. We observed that the single most important factor for survival of L. racemosa cuttings was rooting of the shoots prior to cutting from the parent trees. This is a common feature in the study area, the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia. Seasonal floodings of lower branches induce secondary root growth and can even lead to natural vegetative propagation. Other factors that have favorable effects on the survival of the cuttings are a large shoot diameter, manual defoliation to reduce transpiration, and direct sun irradiation. Additionally, burying a small part of the roots in a way that allows some roots to freely float in the surface water, improves the survival rate to 95%. However, the watering with rooting agents shows slightly negative effects. The surviving shoots grow rapidly and fruit set can be observed within six months after planting in the field. In restoration attempts with L. racemosa it is, therefore, possible to bypass the very sensitive seedling phase by planting shoot cuttings. The value of this method is linked to quicker establishment and reproduction of the cuttings as well as the possibility to plant them in flooded areas, where establishment of propagules and survival of seedlings of L. racemosa is very difficult to achieve.

1487,"Lessons learnt from forty years of international spring bread wheat trials Yield potential is the maximum attainable yield within the limits imposed by the production environment. Better understanding of these constraints and the underlying causes of genotype x environment interaction will improve productivity regionally and globally. For 40 years, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) has distributed wheat yield trials, and collaborators from across the world have provided yield, disease, and agronomic data. Various analyzes of these data have been conducted over the years to assess the effectiveness of CIMMYT's Mexican based breeding program, and to identify key selection environments and genotypes with broad adaptation. Analysis of these data confirmed the value of shuttle breeding in Mexico. Well-watered and terminal heat stress selection environments generated in Mexico associate well with their global target areas. Germplasm targeting dry areas is selected and screened for drought tolerance in Mexico using limited irrigation. This type of screening correlated well with environments in South Asia, but less so with sites in West Asia and South America. On the basis of these findings, drought screening in Mexico has been modified to better reflect a wider array of drier environments. In contrast, CIMMYT's high rainfall environment at Toluca, the other arm of the Mexico-based shuttle, was found to be a poor predictor of global high rainfall areas. The analysis of these data led to the identification of key locations in countries outside Mexico. Integrating information from these sites with that obtained in Mexico has helped improve the efficiency of CIMMYT's global wheat breeding effort.",
1488,"KEULEGAN,GARBIS,H. - A PHYSICISTS LONG LIFE IN HYDRAULICS This biography of Garbis H. Keulegan (1890-1989), a leading figure in hydraulics and fluid mechanics for more than half a century, recounts his early years in Armenia; immigration to the United States; education; military service; employment and technical activities at Westinghouse, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), and the Waterways Experiment Station; awards and recognition; and retirement at age 98 after becoming the oldest and longest-serving (67 years) employee in federal service. His graduate study, work at Westinghouse, and early research at NBS were on solid mechanics. Following his assignment as one of the first staff members of the NBS National Hydraulic Laboratory, his progressive shift of interest to fluid mechanics became complete. At NHL he did his classical work on turbulent open-channel flow, water waves and tides, flow in curved pipes, and salinity intrusion. During World War II he was seconded to the Beach Erosion Board to provide technical guidance for amphibious military landings. Following his mandatory retirement from NBS, he was engaged by WES to continue his work on waves and tides, density currents, and salinity intrusion, and produced his classical analysis of flow through tidal inlets.",
1489,"Assessment and reform of greywater reuse policies and practice: A case study from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates This article presents an assessment of one of the earliest greywater reuse (GWR) experiences in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). In 2003, the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA) imposed a compulsory GWR program on various categories of new buildings in the city. However, implementation of the program faced significant resistance and setbacks and remained limited to about 200 buildings, representing less than 2% water savings. In the analysis presented in this study, the need for GWR was assessed through analyzing SEWA's water supply and demand projections, conducting a 12-month water use survey of 285,000 Sharjah residents from about 140 nationalities, and identifying the areas in the city with intense water use. In addition, analysis and reforms of the various aspects of SEWA's GWR reuse policies and practice were presented and discussed. Reforming the policy to increase GWR to about 10% water savings can lead to significant reductions in desalinated water consumption and wastewater generation and consequently significant reductions in desalination cost (35 million USD/y), energy consumption (225,840 MWh/year) and CO2 emissions (120 ton/year). The case study presented in the article can serve as a reference to guide GWR policies and practice, especially for local authorities in developing countries. Â© 2021 The Authors",
1490,"Assessment of barite of Lasbela, Balochistan, Pakistan, as drilling mud and environmental impact of associated Pb, As, Hg, Cd and Sr Barite deposits of the Lasbela District, Balochistan, hosted in the Ferozabad Group (FG) of Jurassic are relatively pure and have BaO value ranging from 40.18 to 60.91 % with minor amounts of Sr, Fe and Ca. The measured average density of the studied samples (4.21 g/cm(3)) is compatible with the API-13A specification. The quantity of water-soluble alkaline earth metals found is very low (av. 50.76 mg/kg) and safe to be used in the drilling mud. The scanning electron microscope study of some of the selected samples revealed nearly 10 % particles are fine (<6 mu m) and have equant, subrounded to rounded shape; however, larger particles (>10 mu m) are tabular and low in quantity. The average content of Pb (3418 mg/kg) in the barite samples is relatively high as designated by the API specification (1000 mg/kg), while Hg, As and Cd contents are very low, except in a few samples. The average content of Sr is 1.19 %, indicating hydrothermal origin of the barite deposits of the study area and to some extent it is toxic in biological functions. Some of the samples have elevated amount of SiO2 (1.83-8.88 %) which may cause risk of silicosis in the persons either involved in milling industry or at well site. The positive loadings of first factor of principal component analysis for Ba and S, and density revealed genetic alliance with MVT/SEDEX mineralization, and negative loadings of Ca, Mg and Fe demonstrate hydrothermal alteration of host rock.",
1491,"Effect of water elasticity in hydropower's pressurized pipeline on stability of low frequency oscillation For the hydropower stations with longer pressurized pipeline and/or far transmission line, the effect of pipe flow's water elasticity on stability of low frequency oscillation is necessary to be further analyzed. Based on the easily-decoupled elastic model of water flow with different order, the effect of water elasticity on damping analysis of low frequency oscillation is studied in detail by qualitative analysis and computation verification. Furthermore, the coupling resonance in hydro-mechanical-electro system induced by hydro-mechanical system's disturbance is analyzed. The results indicate that: the computational damping of low frequency oscillation is varied with different model order of water flow and its trend is closely related with the inertia time constant of pipe flow; the possible coupling resonance in hydro-mechanical-electro system will lead to power oscillation and following unstable accidents. Especially, this research has great theoretical significance and applied value for power transmission from west to east in Southwest China.",
1492,"Platanus orientalis leaves based hierarchical porous carbon microspheres as high efficiency adsorbents for organic dyes removal Water contamination caused by hazardous organic dyes has drawn considerable attention, among all of the techniques released, adsorption has been widely used, which however to a large degree is dependent on the development of high efficiency adsorbents. Waste biomass based porous carbon is becoming the new star class of adsorbents, and thus contribute more to the sustainable development of the society. In this work, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, abundant waste fallen Platanus orientatis leaves are employed as the raw material for hierarchical activated porous carbon (AK) microspheres via a mild hydrothermal carbonization (210 degrees C, 12.0 h) followed by one-step calcination (750 degrees C, 1.0 h). The APC microspheres exhibit a specific surface area of 135553 m(2).g(-1) and abundant functional groups such as O-H and C=O. Furthermore, the APC microspheres are used as the adsorbents for removal of RhB and MO, with the maximum adsorption capabilities of 557.06 mg.g(-1) and 327.49 mg.g(-1), respectively, higher than those of the most porous carbon originated from biomass. The adsorption rates rapidly approach to 98.2% ( RhB) and 95.4% (MO) within 10 min. The adsorption data can be well fitted by Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, meanwhile the intra-particle diffusion and Boyd models simultaneously indicate that the diffusion within the pores is the main rate-limiting step. Besides, the APC microspheres also demonstrate good recydability, and may also be applied to other areas such as heterogeneous catalysis and energy storage.

1493,"Zika might not be acting alone: Using an ecological study approach to investigate potential co-acting risk factors for an unusual pattern of microcephaly in Brazil Zika virus infections can cause a range of neurologic disorders including congenital microcephaly. However, while Zika infections have been notified across all regions in Brazil, there has been an unusual number of congenital microcephaly case notifications concentrated in the Northeast of the country. To address this observation, we investigated epidemiological data (2014-2016) on arbovirus co-distribution, environmental and socio-economic factors for each region in Brazil. Data on arbovirus reported cases and microcephaly were collected from several Brazilian Ministry of Health databases for each Federal unit. These were complemented by environmental management, social economic and Aedes aegypti infestation index data, extracted from multiple databases. Spatial time ""ecological"" analysis on the number of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes in Brazil show that the distribution of dengue and Zika was widespread in the whole country, with higher incidence in the West-Central region. However, reported chikungunya cases were higher in the Northeast, the region also with the highest number of microcephaly cases registered. Social economic factors (human development index and poverty index) and environmental management (water supply/storage and solid waste management) pointed the Northeast as the less wealthy region. The Northeast is also the region with the highest risk of Aedes aegypti house infestation due to the man-made larval habitats. In summary, the results of our ecological analysis support the hypothesis that the unusual distribution of microcephaly might not be due to Zika infection alone and could be accentuated by poverty and previous or co-infection with other pathogens. Our study reinforces the link between poverty and the risk of disease and the need to understand the effect on pathogenesis of sequential exposure to arboviruses and co-viral infections. Comprehensive large-scale cohort studies are required to corroborate our findings. We recommend that the list of infectious diseases screened, particularly during pregnancy, be regularly updated to include and effectively differentiate all viruses from ongoing outbreaks.",
1494,"Preliminary report - Kocaeli (Izmir) earthquake of 17 August 1999 The M-w 7.4 Kocaeli (Izmit) earthquake occurred at 3:01 am local time 17 August 1999 on the east-west trending north strand of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), about 100 km SE of Istanbul, Turkey. The approximately 125 km long fault rupture and high damage area follows or is close to the south shore of Izmit Bay, and the extension of that line to the east, and has predominantly 2.2 m right lateral displacement, from Adapazari in the east to Yalova in the west. Significant vertical fault scarps of as much as 2 m occur at several locations. Peak ground accelerations of approximately 0.4g were recorded near the fault, and liquefaction and subsidence were observed on the shores of Izmit Bay and Lake Sapanca. Several million persons live in the Izmit region, which has experienced rapid growth and heavy industrialization in the last two decades. The predominant building type is mid-rise non-ductile RC frames with hollow clay tile infill, thousands of which collapsed in a 'pancake' mode. Confirmed dead are approximately 17,000. Estimates of population requiring short to long-term shelter range from 400,000 to 600,000. Lifelines generally performed well, with the exception of underground piping in the heavily affected areas, where major damage is reported. Electric power, highways, rail and telephone were generally functional within several days following the earthquake, and the modern Izmit Water Project (the regional water supply and transmission system) was only lightly damaged and fully functional. The modem Izmit gas distribution system similarly sustained relatively little damage. Fires occurred in a number of collapsed buildings but were generally confined to building of origin. Two fires broke out at the Tupras oil refinery, one of which burned for several days. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1495,"Organic micropollutants in groundwater of India-A review Groundwater pollution due to organic micropollutants is a major cause of concern, especially in parts of the world where available water resources are on the decline. India is the largest user of groundwater where the presence of micropollutants in the subsurface environment has been the focus of many researchers. The objective of this study was to provide a detailed review of studies on micropollutants in Indian groundwater and to provide strategies for further work. It is found that the presence of pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, surfactants, phthalates, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, personal care products, artificial sweeteners, and pesticides in groundwater from different parts of India is reported. Pesticides and phthalate concentrations reported exceed the standard guideline values. This review points out the regions where the groundwater is prone to contamination due to micropollutants. An assessment of temporal variation in the concentration of micropollutants in groundwater has been done only by a few researchers. This study highlighted the need for more research on the possible presence of micropollutants in groundwater, especially in the major polluted rivers in cities where more pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and plastic industries are located. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Organic micropollutants were not new contaminants into the environment but the one entered even decades ago which has threatening effect. The number of studies on organic micropollutants in groundwater is lesser than surface water or wastewater. Scarcity on the studies of micropollutants was a result of definite technical lack in its analysis and complexity in sample preparation. Most of the studies done were related to contamination sites and point sources.",
1496,"Experimental research on a novel porous ceramic tube type indirect evaporative cooler Traditional indirect evaporative coolers (IEC) made of metal foil or polymer suffer from poor surface hydrophilicity in the wet channels and large amount of continuously circulated water. To solve the two problems, a kind of novel porous ceramics material was proposed for manufacturing the IEC in this paper for its high hydrophilicity and water storage features. The high hydrophilic property can improve the cooler efficiency's by increasing the heat and mass transfer area and the water storage behavior enables intermittent water supply so as to reduce the energy consumption of the pump. A porous ceramics tube type IEC was designed, fabricated and tested. The influences of secondary air to primary air ratio and spraying water flow rate were studied. Dynamic performance of the IEC was tested in a typical day of Xi'an, China. Besides, comparisons were made between the novel IEC and other IECs. Experimental results show that the cooling efficiency of the IEC remains stable for 100 min after the tube is fully wetted by 5 min water spray of 150 L/h flow rate. The novel IEC saves 95% of the pump energy consumption compared with traditional one and the highest COP is 34.9. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1497,"Lutzomyia sand fly diversity and rates of infection by Wolbachia and an exotic Leishmania species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama BACKGROUND: Sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) in the genus Lutzomyia are the predominant vectors of the protozoan disease leishmaniasis in the New World. Within the watershed of the Panama Canal, the cutaneous form of leishmaniasis is a continuous health threat for residents, tourists and members of an international research community. Here we report the results of screening a tropical forest assemblage of sand fly species for infection by both Leishmania and a microbe that can potentially serve in vector population control, the cytoplasmically transmitted rickettsia, Wolbachia pipientis. Knowing accurately which Lutzomyia species are present, what their evolutionary relationships are, and how they are infected by strains of both Leishmania and Wolbachia is of critical value for building strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease in humans. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: We collected, sorted and then used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and probable phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae occurring in the understory of Barro Colorado Island in the Republic of Panama. Sequence from CO1, the DNA barcoding gene, supported 18 morphology-based species determinations while revealing the presence of two possible ""cryptic"" species, one (Lu. sp. nr vespertilionis) within the Vespertilionis group, the other (Lu. gomezi) within the Lutzomyia-cruciata series. Using ITS-1 and ""minicircle"" primers we detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi individuals and in 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. Identical ITS-1 sequence was obtained from the Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi, sequence which was 93% similar to Leishmania (viannia) naiffi in GenBank, a species previously unknown in Panama, but recognized as a type of cutaneous leishmaniasis vectored broadly across northern and central South America. Distinct strains of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia were detected in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania. CONCLUSIONS: Both morphological and molecular methods were used to examine an assemblage of 20 sand fly species occurring in the forests of the Panama Canal area. Two of these species, members of separate clades, were found to carry Leishmania at high frequency and hence are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species. A single Leishmania species, identified with high confidence as Le. naiffi, was carried by both species. That Le. naiffi is known to cause cutaneous lesions in South America but has hitherto not been reported or implicated in Panama opens the possibility that its range has recently expanded to include the Isthmus or that it occurs as a recent introduction. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies one important vector of the disease as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps.",
1498,"Radon-The Silent Killer Indoor air quality has garnered attention in recent years. It holds importance in developing countries in particular due to improper fuel usage in houses. However, little attention has been paid to air pollution within institutional premises in India. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas present all around us. It is released from the soil and groundwater samples due to the radioactive decay of naturally occurring uranium in the soil and subsoil strata. With a short life of 3.8 day for its most stable isotope, there is a lot of concern about its health impacts. A worrying sign is the presence of high levels of radon in indoor environments today, which infiltrates the indoor environment through various unsuspecting channels. These include cracks in solid floors, construction joints, cracks in walls, gaps in suspended floors, gaps around service pipes, cavities inside walls and water supply. World Health Organization (WHO) identifies radon to be the second largest source of lung cancer after smoking. Other health risks linked to radon exposure includes certain forms of childhood leukaemia, chromosomal aberration and micronuclei formation. Attention needs to be given on the presence of radon in our schools in particular, as children are at greater risk compared to adults due to increased lifetimes and higher respiratory rates.

1499,"The metamorphic evolution from ultrahigh-temperature to amphibolite facies metamorphism in the Odaesan area after the collision between the North and South China Cratons in the Korean Peninsula The Odaesan Gneiss Complex (Odesan Gneiss Complex) is the eastern end of the Hongseong-Odaesan collision belt in the Korean Peninsula, which is an extension of the Dabie-Sulu collision belt between the North and South China cratons. The Odaesan Gneiss Complex mainly consists of banded and migmatitic gneisses with porphyritic granitoids and amphibolites. The garnet-bearing banded gneisses can be subdivided into garnet-biotite and garnet-orthopyroxene banded gneisses. At the beginning of the post-collision stage, the banded gneisses underwent regional ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism (902-950 degrees C/8.8-9.4 kbar) at ca. 247-245 Ma due to the heat supplied from underplated basic magma, which was generated by the partial melting of the litho spheric mantle caused by the heat supplied from the asthenospheric mantle. As a result of the continuous extensional force, the study area (lower crust) uplifted onto the middle crust depths, and then the study area underwent prograde granulite facies metamorphism from 660 degrees C and 8.7 kbar to 750-760 degrees C and 6.3-6.5 kbar at ca. 227 Ma, causing migmatization, which erased the ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism in most of the study area. The ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism was preserved only in the garnet-orthopyroxene banded gneisses due to their very low water contents. During migmatization, the garnet-biotite banded gneisses were retrograded into upper granulite facies due to the relatively abundant water compared with the garnetorthopyroxene gneisses. Finally, the study area was uplifted to a shallow depth and locally underwent amphibolite fades retrograde metamorphism (575-680 degrees C and 3.1-4.5 kbar). In addition, Paleoproterozoic metamorphic (ca. 1930-1886 Ma) and post-collisional magmatic events (ca. 1847 Ma) are identified based on SHRIMP age dating. These ages agree well with the regional Paleoproterozoic metamorphic and post-collisional magmatic activities reported from other areas of the Gyeonggi Massif. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

1500,"Carotid intima-media thickness and plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine in Mexican children exposed to inorganic arsenic BACKGROUND: Arsenic exposure is a risk factor for atherosclerosis in adults, but there is little information on arsenic and early risk biomarkers for atherosclerosis in children. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an indicator of subclinical atherosclerotic burden that has been associated with plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate associations of arsenic exposure with cIMT, ADMA, and endothelial adhesion molecules [soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1); soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)] in children who had been exposed to environmental inorganic arsenic (iAs). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 199 children 3-14 years of age who were residents of Zimapan, MÃ©xico. We evaluated cIMT using ultrasonography, and plasma lipid profiles by standard methods. We analyzed ADMA, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 by ELISA, and measured the concentrations of total speciated arsenic (tAs) in urine using hydride generation cryotrapping atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: In the multiple linear regression model for cIMT, tAs categories were positively associated with cIMT increase. The estimated cIMT diameter was greater in 35- to 70-ng/mL and > 70-ng/mL groups (0.035 mm and 0.058 mm per 1-ng/mL increase in urinary tAs, respectively), compared with the < 35-ng/mL group. In addition to tAs level, plasma ADMA was a significant predictor of cIMT. In the adjusted regression model, cIMT, percent iAs, and plasma sVCAM-1 were significant predictors of ADMA levels (e.g., 0.419-Î¼mol/L increase in ADMA per 1-mm increase in cIMT). CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic exposure and plasma ADMA levels were positively associated with cIMT in a population of Mexican children with environmental arsenic exposure through drinking water.",
1501,"Thermophilic fermentative bacteria from a deep borehole in granitic rock in Sweden A borehole drilled to a final depth of 6779 m in granitic rock in Gravberg, Sweden, was sampled and examined for the presence and activity of anaerobic bacteria. The application of anaerobic enrichment and isolation techniques resulted in pure cultures of various fermenting bacteria. Growth in enrichment cultures was observed only in those cultures inoculated from water samples from a depth of 3500 m. Pure cultures of anaerobic, fermenting bacteria were obtained with the following substrates: glucose, starch, xylane, ethanol, and lactate. All isolated bacteria were so far undiscribed bacteria by means of their physiological properties. One strain of the glucose fermenting bacteria nas further characterized concerning its phylogenetic position and was found to be closest related to Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum. However, by means of its characteristic metabolism, it was clearly separated from C. thermohydrosulfuricum. No sulfate-reducing or methanogenic bacteria were found in any of the samples. Fermentative bacteria growing in the presence of hematite often reduced the iran and induced the formation and deposition of insoluble iron sulfides.",
1502,"Human health risk assessment of arsenic in groundwater aquifers of Lahore, Pakistan The present study was conducted to estimate As concentration in groundwater and resulting human health risk in terms of chronic daily intake, hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and carcinogenic risk (CR) both for oral and dermal exposure to As. Groundwater samples (n = 100) were collected from ten different towns of Lahore District (Pakistan). Arsenic concentration ranged from 2 to 111 mu g L-1 in groundwater samples of the study area, which was significantly greater than the safe limit of As (10 mu g L-1) in drinking water set by the World Health Organization. Health risk assessment of As showed that HQ (0.1-11) for oral exposure and HI (0.1-11) values also exceeded the typical toxic risk index value of 1. 9.75 x E-05-4.59 x E-03 and 5.89 x E-07-2.77 x E-05 for oral and dermal As exposure, respectively. Both CR and cancer index (CIs) values were higher than United States Environmental Protection Agency limit (10(-6)), suggesting that people are at high risk of As-induced carcinogenicity from oral and dermal exposure to As in drinking water. It was concluded that As contamination of groundwater causes carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health effects to the people; therefore, urgent management and remedial actions are required to protect people from As poisoning.",
1503,"Micromorphology and spectroscopic characteristics of organic matter in waterlogged podzols of the upper Amazon basin In waterlogged environments of the upper Amazon basin, organic matter is a major driver in the podzolisation of clay-depleted laterites, especially through its ability to weather clay minerals and chelate metals. Its structure in eight organic-rich samples collected at the margin and in the centre of the podzolic area of a soil sequence was investigated. The samples illustrate the main steps in the development of waterlogged podzols and belong either to eluviated topsoil A horizons or to illuviated subsoil Bhs, Bh and 2BCs horizons. Organic matter micromorphology was described, and the overall molecular structure of their clay size fractions was assessed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Organic features of the horizons strongly vary both vertically and laterally in the sequence. Topsoil A horizons are dominated by organic residues juxtaposed to clean sands with a major aliphatic contribution. In the subsoil, numerous coatings, characteristic of illuviation processes, are observed in the following horizons: (i) At the margin and bottom parts of the podzolic area, dark brown organic compounds of low aromacity with abundant oxygen-containing groups accumulate in Bhs and 2BCs horizons. Their spectroscopic features agree with the observation of cracked coatings in 2BCs and the presence of organometallic complexes, whose abundance decreases towards low lying positions. (ii) By contrast, black organic compounds of high aromacity with few chelating functions accumulate as coatings and infills in the overlying sandy Bh horizon of well-expressed waterlogged podzols.

1504,"Egypt's economic vulnerability to climate change Climate change is likely to have profound economic consequences for Egypt. This study evaluates the potential economic impacts resulting from changes in water supplies, agriculture, air quality, heat stress, and tourism. Other sensitive sectors, including water pollution, energy consumption, and biodiversity, were not assessed. Sea level rise threatens agricultural land and property in the Nile Delta. Higher temperatures can reduce agricultural production, a situation that can be made worse with lower water supplies. As a result, unemployment and food prices may increase, risking increased malnutrition. Human health in Cairo could be adversely affected by increased particulate matter and heat stress, potentially leading to thousands of deaths valued at tens of billions of Egyptian pounds per year. Annual tourist revenues are estimated to decrease as well. Total economic losses for the sectors mentioned above are estimated to reach similar to 200 to 350 billion Egyptian pounds (EGP; US $36-64 billion), which is equivalent to 2-6% of future gross domestic product.",
1505,"Contamination assessment and health risk of arsenic exposure to stairway dust in the zinc smelting district, Northeast China Stairway dust samples were collected from residential communities in Huludao city to investigate population health risk of arsenic (As) exposure through stairway dust. ArcGIS software was used to analyze As spatial distribution in Huludao city. Hazard index was applied to assess health risk due to exposure to As in stairway dust. The results were that As concentrations ranged from 13.26 to 237.58mgkg(-1), and the mean value was 59.64mgkg(-1), which was seven times as high as the background value of Liaoning Province. The pattern of spatial distribution was concentric rings as the center of Huludao zinc plant, with the extension to the northeast and southwest. The average value of I-geo was 2.176, which fell into moderately polluted level. For non-carcinogenic risk, the hazard indexes were less than 1, indicating that there was almost no health risk for residents exposed to stairway dust. But population risk exposure to dust would increase rapidly with exposure time in stairway. The highest contribution to the overall figure of non-carcinogenic risk and carcinogenic risk appeared to be ingestion of substrate particles followed by inhalation pathway and dermal absorption of As in dust samples. And for carcinogenic risk, the risk values were lower than the threshold range of EPA's safe limits (1x10(-6) and 1x10(-4)), suggesting that potential cancer risk of As due to exposure to stairway dust can be acceptable.",
1506,"Algae removal efficiencies of AS/PDMDAAC coagulants Increased development in the Taihu Lake Basin of China has led to deterioration of water quality that is compounded by a raw water algal content of similar to 3-5 x 10(4) cells/mL. With their current approach of prechlorination combined with aluminum salt coagulants to enhance the treatment process, treatment facilities find it difficult to meet the demand for quality drinking water, especially during periods of algal blooms. Twelve stable composite coagulants were prepared from aluminum sulfate (AS) and poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (PDM-DAAC) at formulations ranging from 0.55/5% to 3.99/20% AS/PDMDAAC. Jar test results indicated that compared with use of AS alone, the AS/PDMDAAC composite coagulants provided greater removal of chemical oxygen demand and free ammonia and demonstrated excellent algae removal efficiencies. Furthermore, the enhanced coagulation process of applying composite coagulants could partly replace prechlorination and reduce the chlorine doses added during the prechlorination and disinfection processes, thus reducing health risks caused by excessive chlorine addition.",
1507,"Pilot Study of a Hybrid Process combining Oxidation- coagulation -microfiltration for Drinking Water Production from Surface Water In this study, microfiltration (MP) combined with oxidation and coagulation was investigated for production of drinking water by Huangpu River. The experiment focused on the effects of various oxidants on reduction in fouling and improvement in quality of treated water. 0.5 mg/L of ozone, 1.5 mg/L of sodium hypochlorite and 0.3 mg/L of potassium permanganate were added before membrane to reduce the fouling. The results showed that significant differences in permeate water and trends of TMP exhibited by adding different oxidants. With ozone as pre-oxidation, permeate water could meet China Drinking Water Regulations (CDWR), however, part of water quality met CDWR with sodium hypochlorite and potassium permanganate as pre-oxidation. IMP increased slowly during filtration period for a long time when ozone and sodium hypochlorite were added. With potassium permanganate as pre-oxidation, rapid increase in IMP was observed, which can be attributed to a lot of manganese oxides deposited in the membrane by analyzing chemical cleaning water. Chemical cleaning of membrane could decrease IMP to initial level. Analysis of chemical cleaning solution indicated that organic matters was responsible for the most fouling, and ozone could reduce membrane fouling effectively.",
1508,"GEOCHEMISTRY OF WASTE FROM THE TAILINGS POND OF PARAUL CAILOR, FUNDU MOLDOVEI METALLOGENIC FIELD, ROMANIA The waste of the tailings pond has a yellowish appearance, over 70-80 wt% consisting of fine and very fine particles. The dominant minerals are quartz, sericite, chlorite and pyrite, while sphalerite and biotite occur accidentally. Translucent crystal grains of presumed hydrated sulfates were identified as well. The pH is very low (mean of 3.1), as well as the abundance of the soluble fraction (mean less than 2.0wt%). Across the surface of the waste deposit, four sectors with specific geochemical properties were identified, using statistical analyses: (1) the northern and southern edges of the horizontal surface (C2), where the waste is the most susceptible to be removed and transported either by wind or by runoff; (2) the flat, horizontal sector Cl, rich in Al, Mg, Mn, and K, where especially the silt and clay particles accumulate; (3) the sector C3 which overlaps the watercourse of the temporary stream, the latter being the main vector of mechanical and chemical removal and transport of waste towards the surrounding areas; (4) the sector C4, the richest in toxic trace elements, related especially to primary sulfides, less mobile because of their higher specific weight. The relation between this geochemical distribution and other properties of the tailings (e.g., mineralogy, grain size, abundance of soluble fraction, pH) suggested that the sectors C2 and C3 present the highest risk to the environment.",
1509,"Cikidang hydrothermal gold deposit in western Java, Indonesia The Cikidang gold deposit, discovered in 1991, is located within the Bayah dome, a Tertiary-Quaternary volcanic zone at west end of Java, which is well known as a gold district (e.g., Pongkor and Cikotok mines). Typical low-sulfidation quartz-adularia-sericite(-calcite) vein deposits represent the gold deposit in the district. The Cikidang vein system comprises four sub-parallel quartz-adularia-sericite(-calcite) veins that are rich in manganese oxide and limonite with very poor amount of sulfides. These vary from 0.5 to 2.7 m thick and extend for up to 1,000 m long. The vein trends roughly N-S and dip, 60degrees to 86degrees toward west. The ore grades vary from trace to 74.9 g/t Au and 1.2 to 225.0 g/t Ag. A K/Ar age determination on adularia yielded 2.4 Ma for the Cikidang vein. The ore minerals are represented by electrum, argentite, aguilarite and pyrite. Electrum shows the compositional ranges of Ag (50-65 atom %). The gangue minerals are dominated by quartz with variable amounts of calcite, sericite, adularia, clay minerals, manganese oxide and limonite. The vein textures are so variable as banded, colloform, comb, brecciated and massive. Host rocks, composed of Miocene lapilli tuff and breccia, suffered from pervasive hydrothermal alterations. Wall rocks adjacent to the vein are characterized by argillic and propylitic alteration. The fluid inclusion study of the Cikidang vein shows homogenization temperatures ranging from 170 to 260degreesC. Salinities are low, generally below 3 wt% NaCl equivalent. Oxygen isotope results suggest meteoric water in origin for ore fluids responsible for the Cikidang deposit.",

1511,"Hydrogeochemistry Assessment of Shallow Groundwater and Human Health Threats in the Northwestern Ordos Basin, China Groundwater is the main sources of water supply for drinking purposes in the Ordos Basin in the northwestern part of China. In order to sustain and protect the quality of groundwater resources, shallow groundwater samples were collected and analyzed to identify the hydrogeochemical characteristics, and to evaluate health risk to human. Cluster analysis showed that the 134 groundwater samples were divided into three classes (i.e., class 1, class 2, class 3). The groundwater types are mostly characterized by SO4-Cl type and SO4 type, mixed HCO3 type. The primary natural mechanisms controlling the chemical compositions are water-rock interaction and evaporation-precipitation. The extremely high concentrations of sulfate could be caused by contamination from pyrite or from infiltration of sulfate from inorganic fertilizers or from wastewater discharges. Results of the assessment of the health risks for ingestion of Cl-, NO3-, F-, Cr, and As in drinking water indicated that the total health risks are beyond the US EPA acceptable level of 10(-6) per year for consumption of groundwater sourced from all three cluster classes. The highest risks were for ingestion of arsenic and chromium in groundwater. The highest total risks to adults and children were 1.51 x 10(-5) and 2.45 x 10(-2) (class 1), 4.12 x 10(-4) and 8.98 x 10(-3) (class 2), 3.06 x 10(-3) and 5.49 x 10(-2) (class 3), respectively. The study showed that there is a high risk of health problems among the residents of the Ordos Basin in China that are ingesting contaminated drinking water, with the health risks to children higher than the risks to adults.",
1512,"A combined deficit index for regional agricultural drought assessment over semi-arid tract of India using geostationary meteorological satellite data The untimely onset and uneven distribution of south-west monsoon rainfall lead to agricultural drought causing reduction in food-grain production with high vulnerability over semi-arid tract (SAT) of India. A combined deficit index (CDI) has been developed from tri-monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly vegetation vigor with a lag period of one month between the two. The formulation of CDI used a core biophysical (e.g., NDVI) and a hydro-meteorological (e.g., rainfall) variables derived using observation from Indian geostationary satellites. The CDI was tested and evaluated in two drought years (2009 and 2012) within a span of five years (2009-2013) over SAT. The index was found to have good correlation (0.49-0.68) with standardized precipitation index (SPI) computed from rain-gauge measurements but showed lower correlation with anomaly in monthly land surface temperature (LST). Significant correlations were found between CDI and reduction in agricultural carbon productivity (0.67-0.83), evapotranspiration (0.64-0.73), agricultural grain yield (0.70-0.85). Inconsistent correlation between CDI and ET reduction was noticed in 2012 in contrast to consistent correlation between CDI and reduction in carbon productivity both in 2009 and 2012. The comparison of CDI-based drought-affected area with those from existing operational approach showed 75% overlapping regions though class-to-class matching was only 40-45%. The results demonstrated that CDI is a potential indicator for assessment of late-season regional agricultural drought based on lag-response between water supply and crop vigor.

1513,"Hydrochemistry and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) Cycling in a Tropical Agricultural River, Mun River Basin, Northeast Thailand Dissolved inorganic carbon isotope composition (Î´(13)C(DIC)), together with major ion concentrations were measured in the Mun River and its tributaries in March 2018 to constrain the origins and cycling of dissolved inorganic carbon. In the surface water samples, the DIC content ranged from 185 to 5897 Î¼mol/L (average of 1376 Î¼mol/L), and the Î´(13)C(DIC) of surface water ranged from -19.6â€± to -2.7â€±. In spite of the high variability in DIC concentrations and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), the Î´(13)C(DIC) values of the groundwater were relatively consistent, with a mean value of -16.9 Â± 1.4â€± (n = 9). Spatial changes occurred in the direction and magnitude of CO(2) flux through water-air interface (F(CO2)). In the dry season, fluxes varied from -6 to 1826 mmol/(m(2)Â·d) with an average of 240 mmol/(m(2)Â·d). In addition to the dominant control on hydrochemistry and dissolved inorganic carbon isotope composition by the rock weathering, the impacts from anthropogenic activities were also observed in the Mun River, especially higher DIC concentration of waste water from urban activities. These human disturbances may affect the accurate estimate contributions of carbon dioxide from tropical rivers to the atmospheric carbon budgets.",
1514,"Hydrogeochemistry in the U-district of Lagoa Real, Brazil The chemistry of surface and groundwaters in the U-district of Lagoa Real (Brazil) was studied, in order to assess the baseline characteristics of the aquatic systems before the start of the uranium exploitation and treatment process. The water of perennial and temporary streams shows low concentration of U (less than 1 mug/l). The water of deep wells used to supply the villages nearby the deposit area does not show significant contamination (I to 8 mug/l U), while two boreholes located in the albitite hosting the mineralization are very rich in U (up to 250 mug/l).",
1515,"Hypomethylation of mitochondrial D-loop and ND6 with increased mitochondrial DNA copy number in the arsenic-exposed population Groundwater arsenic contamination has become a serious global concern due to its adverse effects on human health. Arsenic-induced reactive oxygen species trigger oxidative stress inside mitochondria, which initiate a cascade of events including altered mitochondrial (mt) membrane potential, uncoupling of electron transport chain, and mtDNA damage. A case-control study was conducted to examine the association between arsenic exposure and differences in mtDNA methylation and to assess the downstream consequences. We recruited 221 arsenic-exposed individuals, including 106 individuals with skin lesions (WSL) and 115 subjects without any skin lesions (WOSL) from the Murshidabad district, West Bengal, India. The unexposed group included 101 individuals from the arsenic unexposed area in East Midnapore. We analyzed the status of mtDNA methylation in D-loop region and ND6 gene by methylation-specific PCR. Gene expression was studied by quantitative real-time PCR. Significant hypomethylation in both D-loop and ND6 was observed with a consequent increase in their target gene expression and higher mtDNA copy number in arsenic-exposed populations compared to controls. Further mechanistic insights regarding mitochondrial epigenetic alteration in arsenic exposure will be of critical importance for the prevention of adverse health effects.",
1516,"Biochemical and nutritional attributes of Stevia rebaudiana grown in Pakistan Nutritional and health augmenting facets of Stevia rebaudiana as intense natural sweetener have been studied in different parts of world. Biochemical characterization of well adapted and well cultivated Pakistani Stevia have been carried out which is the need of hour to establish a better framework from nutritional viewpoint. Semi-arid conditions of central Punjab city, Faisalabad, have impacted the chemical composition that have been depicted in carbohydrates, crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber ash and moisture content as 63.59%, 10.64%, 5.47%, 7.60%, 8.75 and 3.95% respectively. Functional attributes have been well observed with slightly acidic to neutral pH 6.14, exhibits good swelling power, WHC, OHC, Bulk density. K, P, Mg, Na, Fe are found in maximum amount coinciding their ADI.

1517,"ISOTOPIC GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF SELECTED NEPHELINE SYENITES AND PHONOLITES FROM THE POCOS-DE-CALDAS ALKALINE COMPLEX, MINAS-GERAIS, BRAZIL This paper presents and discusses the isotopic data from the hydrothermal studies of the Pocos de Caldas Natural Analogue Project. The purpose of these studies was to elucidate the mass transport of relevant elements and isotopes associated with hydrothermal mineralization and alteration at the Osamu Utsumi uranium mine, as applicable to high-temperature radwaste isolation (particularly in the U.S. nuclear waste program). Research efforts were focused on studying the thermal, chemical and hydrologic nature of the palaeohydrothermal regime associated with a breccia pipe at the Osamu Utsumi mine, and related to the geochemical, geochronological and petrological characterization studies of unaltered regional nepheline syenite and phonolite. The regional rocks studied have a vertically elongated deltaD, deltaO-18 pattern, which possibly indicates meteoric water/rock interaction. Regression of Rb-Sr whole-rock isotopic data for the regional nepheline syenite and phonolite samples did not produce isochrons. An internal, mineral-separate isochron regression from a nepheline syenite sample, considered representative of unaltered nepheline syenite of the Pocos de Caldas plateau, yields an age of 78 Ma, and an initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of approximately 0.7051. The initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the regional nepheline syenites are possibly indicative of a mantle source for the alkaline magmatism, with some incorporation of old, high Rb/Sr crustal material. The greater-than-mantle values of deltaO-18, if not due solely to surficial processes, also appear to require some assimilation of crustal material. Sm-Nd isotopic data for the regional rocks do not define any isochrons, although the nepheline syenite samples conform very well to a calculated reference isochron for 78 Ma and a fixed initial Nd-143/Nd-144 of 0.512359. The regional phonolite samples lie markedly off this isochron. This is probably due to the phonolite samples having different initial Nd-143/Nd-144 values. All regional samples lie within the ''Mantle Array'' trend. Their location within epsilon(Nd)-epsilon(Sr) space indicates an asthenospheric Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB)-type source magma also contaminated by continental igneous and metamorphic rocks (e.g. the Precambrian gneiss surrounding the Pocos de Caldas plateau).",
1518,"Study of Uranium in Drinking Water around the Sohna Fault Line in Haryana Quality of drinking water is associated directly with the health of mass population. Therefore, study on radiation level in groundwater has been taken up around the Sohna fault line, Haryana state, India. Uranium concentration has been measured in drinking water samples collected from sources such as hand pump, tube well from different depths around the Sohna fault line, using LED Fluorimetry Technique. Uranium concentration in study area varies from 0.10 mu g/L to 223.16 mu g/L with an average value of 22.09 mu g/L. The average value of uranium concentration is within the safe limit recommended by World Health Organization (WHO, 2011) and Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. The annual effective dose has also been measured in all the water samples and is found to be below the prescribed dose limit of 100 mu Svy-1 recommended by WHO (2011). Risk assessment of uranium in water is also calculated using life time cancer risk, life time average daily dose and hazard quotient. The high uranium concentration observed in certain areas is due to interaction of ground water with the soil formation of this region and the local sub-surface geology of the region.",
1519,"Carbon cycling in the North American coastal ocean: a synthesis A quantification of carbon fluxes in the coastal ocean and across its boundaries with the atmosphere, land, and the open ocean is important for assessing the current state and projecting future trends in ocean carbon uptake and coastal ocean acidification, but this is currently a missing component of global carbon budgeting. This synthesis reviews recent progress in characterizing these carbon fluxes for the North American coastal ocean. Several observing networks and high-resolution regional models are now available. Recent efforts have focused primarily on quantifying the net air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2). Some studies have estimated other key fluxes, such as the exchange of organic and inorganic carbon between shelves and the open ocean. Available estimates of air-sea CO2 flux, informed by more than a decade of observations, indicate that the North American Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) acts as a sink of 160 +/- 80 Tg C yr(-1), although this flux is not well constrained. The Arctic and sub-Arctic, mid-latitude Atlantic, and mid-latitude Pacific portions of the EEZ account for 104, 62, and -3.7 Tg C yr(-1), respectively, while making up 51 %, 25 %, and 24 % of the total area, respectively. Combining the net uptake of 160 +/- 80 Tg C yr(-1) with an estimated carbon input from land of 106 +/- 30 Tg C yr(-1) minus an estimated burial of 65 +/- 55 Tg C yr(-1) and an estimated accumulation of dissolved carbon in EEZ waters of 50 +/- 25 Tg C yr(-1) implies a carbon export of 151 +/- 105 Tg C yr(-1) to the open ocean. The increasing concentration of inorganic carbon in coastal and open-ocean waters leads to ocean acidification. As a result, conditions favoring the dissolution of calcium carbonate occur regularly in subsurface coastal waters in the Arctic, which are naturally prone to low pH, and the North Pacific, where upwelling of deep, carbon-rich waters has intensified. Expanded monitoring and extension of existing model capabilities are required to provide more reliable coastal carbon budgets, projections of future states of the coastal ocean, and quantification of anthropogenic carbon contributions.",
1520,"Virtual industrial water usage and wastewater generation in the Middle East and North Africa 2011-2015 This study presents useful methods for quantifying the volumes of water usage, wastewater generation, virtual water export, and wastewater generated by export for six relevant export industries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. These export industries are based in: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestinian Territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Results show that approximately 4.26 x 10(9) m(3) of water is used per annum and approximately 1.04 x 10(9) m(3) of wastewater is generated during production by the studied industries in 2011. The difference (3.22 x 10(9) m(3)) between the used water and generated wastewater volumes is related to water evaporation or injection underground (oil well pressure maintenance). The net virtual water export of the six studied commodities for the year 2015 from MENA to EU28 [i.e., 28 countries in the European Union] is approximately 3.0 x 10(8) m(3), which is equivalent to approximately 7.05% of the water used by those industries. For example, Saudi Arabia represents the largest net virtual water exporter (approximately 1.25 x 10(8) m(3)). Crude oil represents approximately 2.59 x 10(8) m(3) of the net virtual water export; fertilizers represent 6.5 x 10 7 m(3), while pig iron and olive oil represent 3.9 x 10(5), and 1.3 x 10(5) m(3), respectively. The Saudi Arabian hydrological system is under the greatest pressure externally due to these exports to EU28, where the net virtual water export represents approximately 1.6% of the actual renewable water resources and desalination capacity of this country. In general, this study shows that, in terms of the grey water footprint (GWF), the pollution of water bodies caused by production (year 2011) is relevant for the crude oil, refined petroleum, and olive oil industries, whereas pollution caused by exports to EU28 countries (year 2015) is primarily related to the crude oil industry and olive oil mills The GWFs for all the six industries caused by production and export are 111.8 x 10(9) (for the year 2011) and 18.7 x 10(9) m(3)/year (for the year 2015), respectively. One importance of the current work is that the specific water uses here could be compared to those of the same industries in developed countries. Based on these comparisons, decisions related to the need for water conservation can be made. The implementation of industrial water conservation in the MENA region could alleviate the pressure on water resources and help mitigate the water problems in the MENA. The time in which these results apply for production and export are the years 2011 and 2015, respectively.",
1521,"A screen-printed paper microbial fuel cell biosensor for detection of toxic compounds in water Access to safe drinking water is a human right, crucial to combat inequalities, reduce poverty and allow sustainable development. In many areas of the world, however, this right is not guaranteed, in part because of the lack of easily deployable diagnostic tools. Low-cost and simple methods to test water supplies onsite can protect vulnerable communities from the impact of contaminants in drinking water. Ideally such devices would also be easy to dispose of so as to leave no trace, or have a detrimental effect on the environment. To this aim, we here report the first paper microbial fuel cell (pMFC) fabricated by screen-printing biodegradable carbon-based electrodes onto a single sheet of paper, and demonstrate its use as a shock sensor for bioactive compounds (e.g. formaldehyde) in water. We also show a simple route to enhance the sensor performance by folding back-to-back two pMFCs electrically connected in parallel. This promising proof of concept work can lead to a revolutionizing way of testing water at point of use, which is not only green, easy-to-operate and rapid, but is also affordable to all.",
1522,"Effect of extreme rainfall events on the water resources of the Jordan River As a response to climate change, shifting rainfall trends including increased multi-year droughts and an escalation in extreme rainfall events are expected in the Middle East. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of these shifting trends on stream flow in the Jordan River and its tributaries. We use a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model to generate artificial daily rainfall simulations which capture independently shifting trends of increased droughts and escalated extreme. These simulations are then used as input into a hydrological model calibrated for the upper catchments of the Jordan River to compare the impact on stream flow and water resources between the different rainfall scenarios. We compare the predicted baseflow and surface flow components of the tested watersheds, and find that while an increase in extreme rainfall events increases the intensity and frequency of surface flow, the over all flow to the Jordan River, and the characteristics of the baseflow in the Jordan River system is not largely impacted. In addition, though it has been suggested that in the case of a multi-year drought the karstic nature of the aquifer might lead to more intense, non-linear reductions in stream flow, here we quantify and show the conditions when annual stream flow reduce linearly with rainfall, and when these relations will become non-linear.

1523,"Assessment of environmental exposure factors on child diarrhea and systemic inflammation in the Eastern Cape Poor environmental technologies and gastrointestinal illnesses have been hypothesized to be a primary cause to the lack of impact of child health programs on child stunting rates (low height-for-age) in South Africa. This study assessed correlations between environmental exposures (water source, water treatment, sanitation, refuse), diarrheal occurrences, and systemic inflammation proxies among female and male children under five years of age in the Eastern Cape. A conceptual model was hypothesized using structural equation (SE) modeling and two sex-specific (female and male) datasets were subsequently generated from the data and applied to the hypothesized SE model. Results suggested that environmental exposure variables associated with diarrhea and systemic inflammation proxies were different between females and males. For diarrheal occurrences among females, an increase in local authority management of refuse (compared to household management) (0.161, p-value (p)â€¯=â€¯0.007), sharing sanitation facilities (0.060, pâ€¯=â€¯0.023), and a decrease in the frequency of the treatment of drinking water (-0.043, pâ€¯=â€¯0.025) were correlated with an increase in diarrhea. For males, an increase in household use of flush toilets (as compared to ventilated pit latrines) was correlated with an increase in diarrhea (0.113, pâ€¯=â€¯0.027). For systemic inflammation among both sexes, an increase in household use of water pumped into the premises (as compared to a public water tap) and an increase in diarrheal occurrences were correlated with an increase in systemic inflammation. The data support an increased focus on sex and gender specific factors among field practitioners and policy makers working in the environmental health field in South Africa.",
1524,"Technology and Concept of Wastewater Treatment: Differences Between the Rhine Basin and the Yangtze Basin Based on field visits and literature research, the situations of several typical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Rhine basin and the Yangtze basin were investigated, to compare the technology and concept of wastewater treatment in these two areas. Our results showed that WWTPs in the Rhine performed well in pollutant removal, and have shifted their focus to energy production and nutrient recovery; While in the Yangtze basin, most WWTPs still operate on the sole concept of pollution treatment. Though China's WWTPs attach importance to water reclamation, the related technologies are still under development. In years to come, the construction of New Concept WWTPs is expected by Chinese famous experts, to integrate sustainable wastewater treatment and energy/nutrient recovery. To better plan its future avenue in wastewater treatment, China is suggested to learn from the successful practice of energy production and nutrient recovery of WWTPs in the Rhine.",
1525,"Arsenic burden from cooked rice in the populations of arsenic affected and nonaffected areas and Kolkata City in West-Bengal, India Arsenic contamination of rice irrigated with contaminated groundwater contributes to the additional arsenic burden of the population where rice is the staple food. In an arsenic contaminated area, an experimental field-based study done on nine fields elucidated significant positive correlation between arsenic in irrigation water and soil, irrigation water and rice, and also soil and rice both for Boro (groundwater) and Aman (rainwater) rice. Speciation studies showed that for both Boro (cooked) and Aman (raw) rice from contaminated area, 90% of total recovered arsenic was inorganic. In arsenic contaminated, uncontaminated villages, and Kolkata city, daily quantities of arsenic ingested by adult population from cooked rice diet are equivalent to 6.5, 1.8, and 2.3 L respectively, of drinking water containing WHO guideline value. In contaminated area, daily intake only from cooked Boro rice for 34.6% of the samples exceeded the WHO recommended MTDI value (2 microg In-As day(-1) kg(-1) body wt), whereas daily intake from Aman rice was below MTDI value as was rice from uncontaminated areas and Kolkata city. Our study indicated that employing traditional rice cooking method as followed in Bengal delta and using water having arsenic <3 microg L(-1) for cooking, actual exposure to arsenic from rice would be much less.",
1526,"Retracking Cryosat-2 Data in SARIn and LRM Modes for Plateau Lakes: A Case Study for Tibetan and Dianchi Lakes This paper estimates lake level variations over two small and adjacent lakes in the Tibetan plateau (TP), namely Gemang Co and Zhangnai Co, as well as the inland Dianchi Lake in China using CryoSat-2 SARIn-mode and LRM 20-Hz waveforms over the period of 2011-2018. Different retrackers and a dedicated data editing procedure have been used to process CryoSat-2 data for determining the lake level time series. The lake level estimations are indirectly validated against those from Jason-2 in TP and from in situ data in Dianchi Lake, both showing good agreement with strong correlation coefficients >0.74. The results of this paper suggest that the official ICE retracker for LRM data and APD-PPT retracker for SARIn-mode waveforms are the most appropriate retrackers over Dianchi Lake and TP lakes, respectively. The trend estimates of the time series derived by both retrackers are 61.0 +/- 10.8 mm/yr for Gemang Co and Zhangnai Co in TP, and 30.9 +/- 64.9 mm/yr for Dianchi Lake, indicating that the lake levels over three lakes were continuously rising over the study period. The results of this study show that CryoSat-2 SARIn-mode data can be used for monitoring many small lakes that have not been measured by other altimetry missions in TP.",
1527,"Radiochemical assessment of core water as an indicator of fuel reliability behaviour: A case study Evaluation of coolant activity during nuclear reactor operation is the first step in assessing fuel reliability. Monitoring the activity of selected fission product isotopes in the off-gas system or in the primary coolant provides useful information on fuel status. Non-destructive and destructive methods were used to determine fission products as well as activation products in liquid samples taken from the ET-RR-1 research reactor core water, and examined for indications of fuel leakage during operation. The ET-RR1 is a 2 MW light water reactor at Inshass, Egypt, operated with aluminium cladded 10% enriched uranium oxide. Gamma spectrometry, based on a hyperpure germanium detector, was used to evaluate specific activities of present radionuclides. The release rate of Cs-137 was used to characterize the fuel assemblies while investigating the presence of corrosion pits along the external fuel clad. Radiochemical analysis of core water before and I h after full power operation indicated high activity of 137Cs. About 70% of the Cs-137 was already present in the core water before operation. Caesium-137 to Co-60 ratios, before and after operation, were similar at 274 and 210, respectively. As Np-239 was detected in core water after operation (58 +/- 1.4 kBq(.)L(-1)), the total uranium content in the water before operation was determined using laser fluorimetry to evaluate U traceability, if any. The total uranium content of the core water before and after operation was 0.9 and 1.6 ppm, while water samples from the new and old spent fuel pools showed 1.2 and 2.1 ppm, respectively. Neptunium-239 call be effectively employed as an indicator of degraded fuel conditions and of significant fuel loss. Among others, I-131, I-133, Xe-135, Cs-134, Cs-137 Sr-91, Sr-90, La-140 and Ba-140 were determined. The specific activities of 137Cs and 90Sr measured in the reactor core water before and after operation were about 18 and 12.7 kBq(.)L(-1), and 26 and 15.3 kBq(.)L(-1), respectively. The specific activities of Cs-134, Cs-137, and Sr-90 in water samples from the new spent-fuel pool were 753,43, and 41 kBq L-1, respectively, in comparison with 3.4, 128 and 113 kBq(.)L(-1) in water samples from the old spent fuel pool. These findings raise questions about possible fuel failure and the efficiency of the purification system for water treatment.",
1528,"Drawing the connection between malnutrition and lack of safe drinking water in Guatemala Less than half of the rural Guatemalan population has access to clean water-98% of the country's water sources are contaminated, and only 15 municipalities in the country have operational drinking water treatment systems. Guatemala also has among the world's worst health statistics for chronic malnutrition and substandard child growth attainment. Over the long term, chronic malnutrition and disease leads not only to stunted growth but also to the likelihood that children will not reach their full genetic and educational potential, thus reducing their productivity and earning power. Despite efforts to improve water systems over the past decade, improvements have not kept pace with population increases and migration. Investment in water systems has also declined because of the perceived high cost of centralized water treatment facilities. However, providing safe water does not have to be cost-prohibitive. This article explores how the lack of safe water significantly contributes to the high incidence of diarrheal disease and chronic malnutrition and what can be done to provide clean drinking water to the Guatemalan population. Four factors-all of which can be accomplished at a relatively minor cost-are identified as key to providing clean drinking water to a household or small community.-KD.",
1529,"Controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms in a hyper-eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China): The need for a dual nutrient (N & P) management strategy Harmful cyanobacterial blooms, reflecting advanced eutrophication, are spreading globally and threaten the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems. Increasingly, non-nitrogen (N-2)-fixing cyanobacteria (e.g., Microcystis) dominate such blooms, indicating that both excessive nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads may be responsible for their proliferation. Traditionally, watershed nutrient management efforts to control these blooms have focused on reducing P inputs. However, N loading has increased dramatically in many watersheds, promoting blooms of non-N-2 fixers, and altering lake nutrient budgets and cycling characteristics. We examined this proliferating water quality problem in Lake Taihu, China's 3rd largest freshwater lake. This shallow, hyper-eutrophic lake has changed from bloom-free to bloom-plagued conditions over the past 3 decades. Toxic Microcystis spp. blooms threaten the use of the lake for drinking water, fisheries and recreational purposes. Nutrient addition bioassays indicated that the lake shifts from P limitation in winter-spring to N limitation in cyanobacteria-dominated summer and fall months. Combined N and P additions led to maximum stimulation of growth. Despite summer N limitation and P availability, non-N-2 fixing blooms prevailed. Nitrogen cycling studies, combined with N input estimates, indicate that Microcystis thrives on both newly supplied and previously-loaded N sources to maintain its dominance. Denitrification did not relieve the lake of excessive N inputs. Results point to the need to reduce both N and P inputs for long-term eutrophication and cyanobacterial bloom control in this hyper-eutrophic system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1530,"Adsorption of Iron(II) from Acid Mine Drainage Contaminated Groundwater Using Coal Fly Ash, Coal Bottom Ash, and Bentonite Clay Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a persisting environmental problem and a grievous nuisance in the mining sector. In this study, iron (Fe(II)) removal was tested in AMD samples collected from the Enugu Okpara abandoned coal mine (Nigeria), having iron concentrations of similar to 1300 mg/l. Digestion, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), and batch adsorption tests using coal bottom ash (BA), bentonite clay (BC), and coal fly ash (FA) were performed. Apart from elucidating the effects of adsorbent dose and initial Fe(II) concentrations on the maximum adsorption capacity (q(e)) of the adsorbents, the experimental data were also fitted to well-known adsorption isotherms and kinetic models. The results from batch tests showed that the optimum adsorbent dosages for BA, BC, and FA were found to be 3, 4, and 4 g per 100 ml, respectively. Among the different adsorption isotherm models tested, the Temkin model fitted the experimental data well for Fe(II) removal. Results from kinetic analysis showed that the Fe(II) removal efficiency increased with an increase in the contact time and then remained almost constant after 30 min for the three tested adsorbents.",
1531,"Water markets as coupled infrastructure systems: comparing the development of water rights and water markets in Heihe, Shiyang and Yellow Rivers A Coupled Infrastructure Systems perspective is applied to three cases in north-western China to explain how and why water rights systems and water markets have changed since 1949. The evolution of water rights systems has been shaped by periods of water-supply projects and periods that emphasized regulatory and institutional measures to manage water resources. We argue that water supply infrastructure and water markets have been developed not in sequence but in parallel. The development of water diversion projects and nationwide market-oriented water allocation reform programmes will continue to co-evolve in the future as part of complex coupled infrastructure systems.",

1533,"Removal of manganese from groundwater using a biological arsenic removal ceramic filter In this paper, manganese (Mn) removal efficiency from groundwater was assessed using a simple and low-cost household-based biological arsenic (As) removal filter (ARF). The ARF was constructed using a ceramic filter (made of clay soil and rice bran), an iron netting box, and iron bacterial sludge liquor in a clay pot. Fourteen ARFs were installed in three villages in Khulna (southwestern region of Bangladesh), and Mn removal performances were monitored over the course of 31 days. Groundwater samples from 14 tube wells were analyzed for their major physicochemical quality. The mean concentration of Mn in the water samples was 0.36 mg L-1, which is 3.6 times higher than the Bangladesh standard limit of 0.1 mg L-1. Principal component analysis (PCA) of groundwater quality showed that the contamination of Mn in groundwater was more likely due to the dissolution and weathering process of the MnO(OH) minerals. The ARFs produced less than 0.1 mg L-1 of effluent Mn from an average tubewell water concentration of 0.36 mg L-1. The Eh-pH values observed in all filters indicated that Mn is primarily oxidized by Leptothrix group of iron bacteria and removed through filtration. With respect to long-term performance, the filter was very effective in removing Mn after 1 year of continuous use. The ARF had low cost, required minimal maintenance, and showed long-term sustained use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1534,"Antitoxin therapy of natural avian botulism outbreaks occurred in Brazil Botulism commonly affects water birds and it has recently been observed to be emerging in poultry production. In the present work, outbreaks of botulism in wild native species, such as the black-fronted Piping-guan (Aburria jacutinga), wild duck (Cairina moschata) and its crosses with mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are described. Following treatments with a commercial botulism antitoxin CD, 28 (96.5%) out of 29 animals fully recovered after 24-72Â h. The antitoxin therapy was shown to be a useful option for the treatment of affected birds, including those that were severely affected.",
1535,"Hydrogeochemical Processes Affecting Groundwater Chemistry in the Central Part of the Guanzhong Basin, China Groundwater is essential for the sustainable development of the Guanzhong Basin, China, and its quality is mainly controlled by hydrogeochemical processes and anthropogenic pollution. This study used statistical and multivariate statistical analysis approaches to recognize the hydrogeochemical processes and affecting factors of groundwater in the central part of the Guanzhong Basin. Correlations among 14 hydrochemical parameters were statistically examined. Principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) techniques were applied to analyze the physicochemical variables to understand the affecting factors of groundwater quality in the study area. The correlation analysis results indicate that cation exchange is the dominant process affecting the concentration of Na(+) and Ca(2+) in the groundwater. Both the PCA and FA indicate that minerals dissolution/precipitation and human activities are the key factors that affect groundwater quality. All parameters except CO(3)(2-) and pH increase from C1 to C4 obtained through the Q mode HCA. C4 has a hydrochemical type of SO(4)-NaÂ·K, indicating that the sample of this cluster is primarily influenced by anthropogenic processes.",
1536,"Temporal variations of benthic diatom community and its main influencing factors in a subtropical river, China Benthic diatoms are the main component in many aquatic ecosystems such as streams, creeks and rivers, and they function as important primary producers and chemical modulators for other organisms in the ecosystems. In this study, the composition of benthic diatoms was investigated and further explored the primary physicals and chemicals affecting their temporal variations in the upper Han River, China. There were seasonal variations in physical and chemical variables in waters over the sampling period of 2007-2010. Water temperature (t), chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), silica and fluoride were much higher in the high flow season (i.e., July or August) than these in the base flow season. Three species Achnanthidium minutissimum (composed of 10.7% of the total diatom abundance), Achnanthidium pyrenaicum (11.9%), and Achnanthidium subatomus (12.7%) accounting for more than 5% of the total diatom abundance were persistently dominant in all seasons, while the other two prostrate and motile species including Eolimna minima and Nitzschia dissipata also dominant in the base flow season. The species richness always peaked in autumn with significant difference with summer (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), and density of benthic diatom varied and peaked in April. Analyses indicated that the temporal variation in benthic diatom communities was strongly related to t, nitrogen, organic pollutants (indicated by COD and DOC), and hydrological regime. The research will expand the understanding of water chemistry monitoring, and improve watershed- scale management and conservation efforts in the upper Han River, China.",
1537,"Assessment of sources for higher Uranium concentration in ground waters of the Central Tamilnadu, India The uranium concentration in groundwater has attained greater importance considering the health effects in mankind. Groundwater being the major source of uranium; sampling and analysis of groundwater for the major cations and anions along with uranium has been carried out in hard rock aquifers of Madurai district. The sampling has been carried out in varied aquifers like, Charnockites, Hornblende Biotite Gneiss, Granites, Quartzites, Laterites and sandstone. The cation and anions showed the following order of dominance Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and that of anions are HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3 (-) > PO43-. Higher concentration of uranium was found along the granitic aquifers and it varied along the groundwater table condition. Further it was identified that the mineral weathering was the predominant source of U in groundwater. Tritium studies also reveal the fact that the younger waters are more enriched in uranium than the older groundwater with longer residence time.",
1538,"Assessing Soil Quality in a Semiarid Tropical Watershed Using a Geographic Information System Subsistence agriculture under rainfed conditions and declining or stagnant yields on irrigated farmland has raised concerns about resource management and long-term sustainability in the subtropical, semiarid region of India. Soil quality assessment has been recognized as an important step toward understanding the effects of land management practices within an agricultural watershed. This study addressed the spatial variability of soil properties and their quality at the watershed level using geostatistical methods. Soil samples from the 0- to 20-cm depth were collected from 118 locations on a 100- by 100-m grid across an 88-ha watershed at Sakaliseripalli village in the Nalgonda District in Andhra Pradesh State, India. Geostatistical analysis showed that most of the soil parameters were moderately spatially dependent. An assessment framework, including a minimum data set, linear scoring technique, and additive indices, was used to evaluate the soil quality index (SQI). Principal component analysis identified cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Na percentage, DTPA-extractable Zn, available P, available water, and dehydrogenase activity as the most important indicators for evaluating soil quality. A kriged map of SQI was prepared for the watershed. The SQI was higher in irrigated systems (3.01) than under rainfed conditions (2.53), and it was 2.61 and 2.53 in fallow and permanent fallow fields, respectively. In this study, potential soil loss calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation and crop yield were identified as the quantifiable management goals; the results indicated that good soils having higher soil quality indices were also productive and less erosion prone.",
1539,"A Coupled Nonlinear Flow Model for Particle Migration and Seepage Properties of Water Inrush through Broken Rock Mass A large number of statistics indicate that broken rock mass always transforms into a flowing channel and leads to water inrush disasters in mining engineering, such as fault, karst, and strongly weathered rock mass. During the process of water inrush, the structure of the broken rock mass is constantly changing due to seepage erosion under high-velocity flow. Therefore, it is of vital importance to quantitatively evaluate the flow behavior of the water inrush related to the seepage erosion in order to prevent or reduce the risks. This study described a coupled nonlinear flow model, which couples the high-velocity seepage, the small particle migration, and the evolution of the broken rock mass structure. The model was verified firstly for simulation of nonlinear flow behavior by comparing with the traditional one. Then, the proposed model was used to simulate the evolution of particle migration and seepage properties of the water inrush through broken rock mass by a numerical case. The simulation results generally agree well with the existing experimental results. The simulations indicate that small particle migration causes the unstable characteristics of the seepage and the heterogeneity properties of the broken rock mass, which lead to the nonlinear flow behavior of the water inrush in both time and space. From a different perspective, it also indicates that the proposed model is capable of simulating the interaction of high-velocity seepage, small particle migration, and evolution of broken rock mass structure in the process of water inrush.",
1540,"Bacteriological pollution of ground water in textile city, Bhilwara, Rajasthan (India) The growing population and inadequacy of municipal water supply has led to exploitation of ground water resources for drinking water. However, the quality of ground water has deteriorated substantially due to malpractice in sewage and garbage disposal. This study was carried out to evaluate the quality of ground water in urban area of Bhilwara. The bacteriological analysis of 107 samples from various areas in the town revealed that in Gulmandi area and near Sanganer gate area, the water contains an exceeding high number of coliforms and, therefore, is not suitable for human consumption.",
1541,"Manifestation of arsenicosis patients and factors determining the duration of arsenic symptoms in Bangladesh This study analyzed a total of 1482 arsenicosis patients living in 6 of 496 upzilas (sub-districts) of Bangladesh, who were identified through household screening and then confirmed by a trained medical team headed by medical officer. Melanosis was common (97%) among them but about two-thirds (68.7%) of the patients were suffering from keratosis. Average age was 36 years and average duration of arsenic symptoms was 3 (median) years. About 50% of the patients had been drinking tubewell water more than 24 years. Melanosis was significantly associated with younger patients (P=0.031), shallower tubewell (P=0.005), and complication of conjunctivitis (P<0.001). Keratosis was also significantly associated with older age (P=0.022), shallower tubewell (P<0.001), complication of conjunctivitis (P<0.001), bronchitis (P<0.001), loss of appetite (P<0.001), and wasting (P<0.001). Duration of arsenic symptoms was significantly associated with older age (P<0.001), male (P=0.002), married (P<0.001), smoking (P=0.002), longer duration of consuming tubewell water (P<0.001), complication of conjunctivitis (P=0.002), loss of appetite (P<0.001), wasting (P=0.006), and social problem faced having arsenicosis (P=0.040). Multivariate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) indicated that keratosis (OR=2.00; 95% CI: 1.56-2.56) was significantly associated with longer duration of arsenic symptoms; loss of appetite (OR=1.40; 95% CI: 1.12-1.74) was a significant complication for longer duration. Similarly smoking (OR=1.33; 95% CI: 1.06-1.68) was positively associated with longer duration of arsenic symptom. These findings will help the policy makers of Bangladesh to understand about the factors that may affect the severity condition of the patients through prolongation of arsenic symptoms.",
1542,"Emerging solid waste leachate pollutants and brewing effluent on delta eco-zones; Impact on environmental resources sustainability, a case of Niger Delta Nigeria There is no sustainable management of effluent or any form of treatment of MSW leachates in Nigeria. This complex liquid contains an excessive concentration of biodegradable and non-biodegradable products which includes organic matters, heavy metals, manganese, bacteria and fungi that have a capacity of polluting the plants, soil and water resources. These emerging eco-toxicants find their way onto the eco-zones of the delta resources and cause avoidable harm to the natural ecosystems. Even as biodegradation undergoes natural attenuation, it relies on several mechanisms such as dilutions, sorption, and environmental conditions etc. to proceed without human intervention. But monitoring these reductive natural processes of the concentration is not prioritized. This paper serves as an expository of the current numerical features of bacteria and fungi as well as physico-chemical parameters of current surface water, leachates, and soil samples taken in the study area. Results of microbial analysis of this study showed that microbial and fungi counts varied in all the water samples. Counts of total heterotrophic bacteria were high in samples 1 and 3 for water; samples 1 and 2 for leachate and low in sample 3 for water which served as control. However, we recommend strong environmental monitoring as a remedial solution.",
1543,"Spatial distribution, origin, and health risk assessment of manganese contamination in groundwater in a grassland area of Eastern China High concentrations of manganese (Mn) in drinking water may have negative effects on human health. This study attempted to better understand the extent of Mn contamination in groundwater by comparing the water quality index with the Chinese drinking water standard limit. In addition, variogram analysis was conducted and the spatial distribution of Mn was determined using Surfer 11 software, and the origin of the Mn in groundwater was discussed. Associated risks for human health for different age groups including infants, children, and adults were assessed using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) model. The results showed that the maximum observed Mn concentration was 2.48 mg/L, and the minimum value was below 0.05 mg/L. 76.3% of samples exceeded the Chinese limit (0.1 mg/L). In addition, the maximum value of the water quality index (I-i) was 24.8, indicating that the groundwater in the study area was seriously contaminated by Mn. High Mn concentration (>0.1 mg/L) was distributed in the alluvial plain of the Mo River, while areas with the highest Mn concentrations (>1 mg/L) were distributed in BaYanKuLun country and in hilly areas. The dissolution and leaching of the parent material, redox status, and human activities could raise the concentration of Mn in groundwater. The maximum hazard quotient (HQ) values were 0.770, 0.739, and 0.709 for infants, children, and adults, respectively, with greater HQ values for infants than children and adults due to their lower body weight. At present, groundwater was determined to be safe for humans to drink. However, areas with groundwater Mn concentrations above the Chinese drinking water standard limit (>0.1 mg/L) should be treated to ensure their safety. These findings will be helpful for local authorities when they are determining groundwater management plans and protection measures, as well as beneficial for groundwater protection and utilization in this area. These results can also provide a reference for relevant studies in other regions of the world.",
1544,"Remote Sensing-Assisted Basin-Scale Water Resources Management Considering Climate Change and Human Activities Impacts Human interventions and climate change have caused significant alterations in the hydrologic response of several highly managed basins in Iran. One of these alterations is a considerable reduction in streamflow quantity, resulting in severe water supply insecurity. This paper presents an integrated modeling approach combining remote sensing, water balance analysis, reservoir operations, and water allocation policy evaluations. The approach helps in understanding of the relative contribution of anthropogenic factors in places where a major challenge is the lack of measured data for the historical time series of water withdrawals for agricultural development and water lost from the system through actual evapotranspiration (AET). Calibrated moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data of monthly AET (MOD16), modified Thornthwaite-Mather (M-TWM) water balance model, annual MODIS Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) products (MCQD12Q1), mass curve analyses, and periodic analysis of water balance parameters were used to evaluate the contribution of anthropogenic factors and the effect of climatic impacts on the inflow time series for the Talvar Reservoir. The procedure led to an estimation of the naturalized series of the streamflow free of anthropogenic impacts; based on this, more plausible estimates of the basin's future water availability were determined, which were then used in a water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model for Talvar Reservoir operations and water allocations. The study yielded four main results. First, it was seen that there were two abrupt change points in the analyzed mass curves, in the years 1998 and 2007, dividing the study period (1988-2012) into three periods. Periodic analysis of water balance parameters showed that while climate change caused streamflow changes in postimpact period A (1998-2007), intensified human activities brought about streamflow changes in postimpact period B (2008-2012). Secondly, it was found that the naturalized series of the Talvar streamflow had a better correlation coefficient with precipitation than the observed series for river flow. Thirdly, despite the proposed approach lacking the use of some water balance components such as soil moisture and snow water equivalent, the percentage of unaccounted water content was between 5% and 10%, indicating good accuracy of the proposed approach as a tool for sustainable water resources management. Fourth, the WEAP model simulation results demonstrated that the unfavorable condition of the aquifer can be ameliorated by applying proper management policies. The results also showed that to increase water supply security and facilitate sustainability, a certain amount of reduction in ground-water withdrawals and agricultural areas is inevitable.",
1545,"Evolution of a deep-water ferromanganese nodule in the South China Sea in response to Pacific deep-water circulation and continental weathering during the Plio-Pleistocene The South China Sea (SCS) is connected to the West Pacific through a deep channel in the Luzon Strait. Thus the SCS deep water is sensitive to the evolution of Pacific Ocean circulation, which significantly influences the global climate system. Geochemical data (Pb isotope and redox-sensitive elements data) and magnetic data were determined for a Fe-Mn nodule obtained from Jiaolong seamount in the central SCS. These records reflect interactions between changes in ice sheets, deep Pacific circulation, and weathering inputs to the deep SCS during the Pliocene and Quaternary. Our results show that the SCS deep-water environment can be divided into three major Stages (Stages 1-3). Stage 1 (similar to 4.8-1.4 Ma) was characterized by a well-oxygenated Pacific Deep Water (PDW) and lower dust inputs: then moderate stable deep-water ventilation and greater inputs of Asian dust occurred during Stage 2 (1.4-0.9 Ma). During Stage 3 (<0.9 Ma), a more isolated PDW was accompanied by sluggish Pacific overturning circulation, probably due to the weakened southern-sourced deep-water formation. In general, the progressive intensification of northern hemisphere ice-sheet play an active role in controlling the variation of the deep-water environment in the SCS. Interestingly, the variation in deep-water ventilation lagged behind weathering and erosion around the Middle Pleistocene Transition, which strongly indicates that the ocean and continent environments had different sensitivities to the global paleoclimatic changes at the glacial climate boundary.

1546,"Pyrosequencing analysis of source water switch and sulfate-induced bacterial community transformation in simulated drinking water distribution pipes Inter-basin water transfer and source water switching will be increasingly launched due to significant population increase and the shortage of the local water resources in cities around the world. Source water switch may cause physiochemical and microbiological de-stabilization of pipe material, biofilms, and loose deposits in drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Great sulfate alteration during source water switch had been deemed as the main cause of a red water case that occurred in a northern China city. To ascertain the relationship between water quality changing and bacterial communities of biofilms in DWDS and possible bacteria risk in a red water case, water quality changing experiments in simulated DWDSs were conducted for approximately 2 years. Twenty-five corrosion scale samples and eight water samples collected from pipe harvest sites or during experimental periods were analyzed for their bacterial community composition by 454-pyrosequencing technology. Taxonomy results together with redundancy analysis (RDA) or canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis all indicated that bacterial community of samples with groundwater (GW) or surface water (SW) supply history and their variations under high sulfate water were rather different owing to different water source histories and the original pipe scale characteristics. Potential opportunistic pathogens: Burkholderia, Escherichia-Shigella, Mycobacterium, Serratia, Ralstonia, Novosphingobium, Flavobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Sphingopyxis were observed in scale or water samples.",
1547,"Risk Factors and Hazards in the Household Environment for Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Urban Preschool Children of Vellore: A Case-Control Approach in the MAL-ED Birth Cohort OBJECTIVES: To study the household environmental risk factors and hazards associated with elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in preschool children in an urban setting of Vellore, South India. METHODS: A case-control study within the MAL-ED (Etiology, Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development) birth cohort was conducted between January 2014 and January 2015. The study included 153 pre-school children: 87 cases and 66 controls with elevated and normal BLLs, respectively. A structured questionnaire was used to assess the sociodemographic profile, household environment, breastfeeding practices, children's habits, and the use of cosmetics in them. Household environmental samples of wall and door paint, floor dust, drinking water, and cosmetics were estimated for lead levels using gas flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). RESULTS: Children born with low birth weight, those living in houses painted at least once in the last five years and those residing in houses older than ten years had a higher odds of EBLLs [OR (95% CI)â€‰=â€‰3.79 (1.24-11.1); 4.84 (1.42-16.53); 5.07 (2.06-12.46), and 2.58 (0.99-6.69)], respectively. Drinking water samples from both cases (88%) and controls (95%) had lead levels more than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA recommendation of 0.015Â ppm. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth weight and the household environment pose important risk factors/hazards for elevated blood lead levels in urban preschool children. Multipronged interventions that include government legislations, household environmental modification, safe water supply, and community education are pivotal in reducing lead exposure in young children.",
1548,"Associative effects of lignin-derived biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi applied to soil polluted from Pb-acid batteries effluents on barley grain safety While disobeying environmental regulations of Pakistan, several Pb-acid batteries recycling and repairing units discharge their effluents into water canals that irrigate arable fields. Resultantly, serious ecological risks, as well as human health hazards through consumption of edible crops grown on such Pb-polluted soils have been reported. In this experiment, we observed associative effects of amending a soil polluted from Pb-acid batteries effluents (SPB) with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and lignin-derived biochar (LBC) on barley grain safety to human health. The SPB was treated with AMF inoculum (a consortium of four AMF species), lignin (LN), and LBC, as sole treatments and AMF inoculum with LN and LBC. Barley parameters involving Pb distribution in grain and other parts, grain biochemistry, and nutrition were assessed. Likewise, Pb bioavailability in SPB, AMF root colonization, soil enzymes, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and AMF produced total glomalin related soil protein (TGSP) were also scoped. Additionally, human renal cells (HEK 293) cytotoxicity test was performed by opting barley grain-related Pb concentrations. Results show that LBCÂ +Â AMF significantly reduced grain Pb concentrations below the critical limit [4.67Â mgÂ kg(-1) (WHO/FAO standard)], AMF colonization, MBC, soil enzymology, and TGSP, compared to control. Likewise, rest barley parameters were also improved in this treatment. Contrary to other treatments, grain produced on LBCÂ +Â AMF did not result in (a) cell apoptosis, (b) cell distortion and (c) cohesion loss. Immobilization of Pb in SPB was due to the dilution effect of Pb adsorption on LBC, AMF mycelium and TGSP which resulted in a significant drop of grain Pb concentrations below the critical limit and ultimately no harm to HEK 293 cells. Our findings endorse that grain produced at LBCÂ +Â AMF treatment are safer for human consumption and will not pose health risks. The LBCÂ +Â AMF application can remediate SPB for safer cereal production.",

1550,"Local responsiveness in distant markets: Western gramophone companies in India before World War I Multinational corporations face the challenge of balancing global integration and local responsiveness. Localization strategies have been much debated in the literature, and scholars have suggested the 1980s as a watershed moment leading to the development of distinctly transnational companies sensitive to both global and local demands. The gramophone industry before WWI is one of the earliest examples of a trade balancing global integration and local responsiveness, already facing many of the challenges typically attributed to the global business of the late twentieth century. In focusing on the Indian market before WWI, this article traces the competition between different Western gramophone companies and their business strategies for this economically attractive market with institutional voids and rising Indian nationalism. It addresses the specificity of the gramophone and music industry, the political context, and the flow of information between headquarters and subsidiaries showing how and why these companies developed into transnational entities.",
1551,"FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF TURKEY BREAST MUSCLE AND THE SALUTOGENIC FEEDING REGIMEN FORMULATIONS (A PILOT STUDY) The objective of this study was to conduct a preliminary assessment of the impact of adding salutogenic formulations to turkey feeding diets on the fatty acid profile of intramuscular fat from breast and on their lipid profile indicators. The experiment was carried out on 60 BIG-6 breed turkeys. Turkey toms were fattened up to 20 weeks of age (140 days). From the rearing day of 42, the turkeys in the control group (BIOPOINT) were given Biopoint (R) supplements in drinking water (copper, selenium, flavonoid, lysine, vitamins C and E, garlic extract), while the experimental group was given Multicraft. fermented herbs extract (FHE) containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L. casei, L. plantarum. Twelve hours post mortem, m. pectoralis superficialis was excised and used for sampling (n=30 for each group), then stored for 18 months at the temp. of -20 degrees C. 12 samples from or each group were taken for analysis in this pilot study. Once the samples were defrosted, the lipid profile was evaluated with the use of gas chromatography. The total antioxidant capacity of meat was determined by using the FRAP method. Based on FA contents, the following indexes were calculated: atherogenicity (AGI), thrombogenicity (TI), polyene peroxidisability (PI), nutri value (NVI) and h/H ratio. Regarding consumers' health, the lipids from FHE group of turkeys were characterized by a more expedient lipid acids profile and the following indicators: P/S (1.32), TI (0.63), h/H (1.41), PI (42.1), polygene index (0.06), compared with those from BIOPOINT group turkeys (vs. 1.17; 0.67; 1.26; 0.0; 38.3). Supplementation with FHE had a positive impact on the total antioxidant status of the turkey muscles. It may be concluded that owing to its positive influence on the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, the breast meat sourced from turkeys fattened with FHE supplementation with a confirmed salutogenic lipid profile may be beneficial for the health of consumers in the context of prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",
1552,"Association of respiratory complications and elevated serum immunoglobulins with drinking water arsenic toxicity in human We assessed the relationship between chronic arsenic exposure through drinking water with respiratory complications and humoral immune response by measuring serum immunoglobulin profiles in the affected subjects (arsenicosis patients) living in the arsenic endemic rural villages of Bangladesh. The duration of exposure was determined through detailed history of the patients (n=125) and the levels of arsenic in the drinking water and urine samples were determined. The mean duration of exposure in the patients was 7.4+/-5.3 y, and the levels of arsenic in the drinking water and urine samples were 216+/-211 and 223+/-302 micro g/L, respectively, compared to 11+/-20 and 29+/-19 microg/L, respectively, in the unexposed subjects. There was high prevalence of respiratory complications like breathing problems including chest sound, asthma, bronchitis and cough associated with drinking water arsenic toxicity. Arsenicosis patients had significantly elevated levels of IgG (P<0.001) and IgE (P<0.001) while the levels of IgA were also significantly higher (P<0.005) but IgM were similar to that of the control subjects. Analysis of the clinical symptoms based on skin manifestations showed the levels of both IgG and IgE were significantly elevated during the initial stages while IgE were further elevated with the duration of arsenic exposure. Arsenicosis patients with respiratory complications had mean serum IgE levels of 706+/-211 IU/mL compared to 542+/-241 IU/mL in patients without apparent involvement with the respiratory system (P<0.01). The eosinophil counts in the patients did not differ significantly from the unexposed subjects indicating that elevated levels of serum IgE might not be due to allergic diseases, rather it could be due to direct effects of arsenic. We found significant linear relationships between the levels of serum IgE and inorganic phosphorus (P<0.05), and serum IgA levels with urinary excretion of arsenic (P<0.001). These observations suggested that arsenic toxicity caused respiratory complications, induced changes in the humoral as well as mucosal immune responses.",
1553,"Fast and slow ships from China: The speed of Dutch East Indiamen reconsidered This article questions the commonly held assumption that the ships of the Dutch East India Company VOC were slower than those of other East India companies. Recently, Solar and De Zwart showed that Dutch ships were slower on outward voyages to a number of Asian destinations during the periods 1770-1775 and 1783-1792. They cited as plausible explanations differences in ship design resulting from constraints imposed by the Dutch shallow inland waterways and the slow adaptation of copper sheathing in the late eighteenth century. Research by the author of this article leads to a critical assessment of these explanations. Moreover, additional new research into homebound voyages from China undertaken by ships of four East India companies, for the periods 1730-1740, 1750-1755, 1770-1775 and 1783-1792, leads to the outcome that - concerning speed - Dutch ships could compete very well with those of the English, Swedish and Danish companies.",
1554,"Evaluation of point-of-use drinking water treatment systems' performance and problems Applications of Point-of-Use Drinking Water Treatment Units (POU-DWTUs) are common in many parts of the world. This paper presents the operational conditions of POU-DWTUs in Iran (Qom province) as a case and discuses the problems and the possible health-related aspects. The devices which were studied consisted of primary filter, carbon filter, Reverse Osmosis membrane, and storage tank. During a cross sectional study, 240 water samples from the input and output of different POU-DWTUs were collected and analyzed. Half of POU-DWTUs users did not have correct information about the operational principles and 35% of them were not satisfied about taste and odor of the treated water. Analysis showed that POU-DWTUs were able to reduce the dissolved solids content more than 90% and produced soft water. However the amount of heavy metals removed by POU-DWTUs varied from 5% for Al to 86% for Cd and their removal average was 43%. High concentration of Pb in both raw and treated water was remarkable. It was found that POU-DWTUs are not successful and reliable in the complete removal of heavy metals. Moreover, considering possible long-term health effects of soft water consumption and some microbial contamination of treated water, it is imperative to take proper actions for effective provisions on quality of water produced by POU-DWTUs.",

Although evidence of its traditional indications is anecdotal, rooibos tea is regarded as a general health tea. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Available contemporary research indicates to broad cell protective activity of rooibos focusing on its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycaemic and antithrombotic features affecting metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk and neuroprotection. Nevertheless little is known about its impact on brain functions. The present experiment aimed to evaluate the possible behavioural and neurochemical effects of long-term oral administration of ""fermented"""" rooibos herbal tea (FRHT) infusions to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infusions, prepared using 1, 2 and 4â€¯g of ""fermented"""" (oxidised) A. linearis leaves for 100 ml of hot water, were characterised in terms of flavonoid content by ultra-high and high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-qTOF-MS, HPLC-DAD) and administered to rats as sole drinking fluid for 12 weeks. Spatial memory behaviour was assessed in a modified version of the Morris water maze. Dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and their metabolite levels (DOPAC, 3-MT, HVA, MHPG, 5-HIAA) were quantified in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum by HPLC-ECD. Body weight and blood glucose level were additionally estimated. RESULTS: All FRHT-treated rats showed improvement of long-term spatial memory defined as increased number of crossings over the previous platform position in SE quadrant of the water maze. It was not accompanied by excessive motor activity. Striatal dopamine and its metabolite 3-MT (3-methoxytyramine) levels were increased in treated rats. There were no differences in body weight gain between control and treated animals but blood glucose level was significantly lower in the latter ones. CONCLUSION: The improvement of long-term memory in FRHT-treated rats and stimulating impact of FRHT on their dopaminergic striatal transmission support the wellness enhancing effect of rooibos tea, contributing to a better understanding of the neurological background of traditional habitual consumption of this herbal tea.",
1556,"Chemical Constituents, Growth and Flowering of Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt Plants as Affected by Glutamic Acid and Irrigation by Different Wastewater Treated Effluents THIS study deals with the effect of glutamic acid and the reuse of chemically treated wastewater on the chemical constituents of Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt Plants in a batch-pot experiment. This chemical constituent includes the nutrient elements (N, P, K), micronutrient elements (Fe, Mn), sodium, as well as heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Zn). In this study different doses of glutamic acid were examined in combination with different types of treated wastewater to investigate the environmental stress on Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt Plants. The study was conducted during the two successive seasons of (2015/2016-2016/2017) in the greenhouse of National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt, aimed to study the response of Coreopsis tinctoria plants to glutamic acid application at four chemical concentrations (0, 50, 100 and 150 ppm) as well as the effect of treated wastewater as a source of irrigation. Besides, this investigation includes the impact on growth and flowering of Coreopsis tinctoria plants. The physical and chemical characteristics of the treated wastewaters were investigated and reused to determine the beneficial advantages as an additional water resource. It was concluded that Glutamic acid and irrigation with three types of treated wastewater effluents individually induced favorable changes in Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt plants in terms of chemical constituents, vegetation and flowering. Thus, the effluent of the chemically treated municipal wastewater can be reused safely without any side effect. Meanwhile, type of treatment has an important effect on the final chemical characteristics of the treated wastewater, particularly the nutrient elements and heavy metals. The reuse of treated wastewater is the most important challenge in the near future to increase the water budget in Egypt as the population escalating and the stringent need for more cultivated land. Consequently, the need for extra safe water resources should be supplied.",
1557,"Mineralogy, Geochemistry, and Genesis of Kaolinitic Claystone Deposits in the Datong Coalfield, Northern China Gray-black kaolinitic claystones of industrial value are abundant in Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian coal-bearing strata of the Datong Coalfield of northern China. The main types are tonsteins and cryptocrystalline kaolinitic claystones, distinguished by the thinness and greater crystallinity of kaolinite in the former and by the presence of detrital illite and authigenic pyrite in the latter. In order to determine the formation history of these two types of kaolinitic claystone, the petrological, mineralogical, and geochemical characteristics of borehole samples from the Upper Carboniferous Taiyuan Formation which comprises siliciclastics and coal seams deposited in a coastal environment, were analyzed. In addition to kaolinite, the claystones contain subordinate illite, quartz, pyrite, anatase, feldspar, siderite, and calcite. The tonsteins and cryptocrystalline kaolinitic claystones have different sources, as shown by petrographic data, elemental ratios, and chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns. The volcanic origin of the tonsteins is revealed by an abundance of volcanic quartz and vitric fragments as well as Al2O3/TiO2, Zr/Hf, and Nb/Ta ratios consistent with a felsic igneous source. Their REE fraction was derived from feldspars or micas of the parent rocks, and the fraction decreased with alteration of these minerals to kaolinite. The sedimentary origin of the cryptocrystalline kaolinitic claystones is revealed by an abundance of detrital quartz and illite grains derived from either granite or sedimentary upper crust, and by the total REE contents (sigma REE) and (La/Yb)(N) values which are consistent with granitic material. Their depositional environment was in a transitional (coastal) setting (as shown by intermediate Sr/Ba ratios) hosting an open acidic hydrologic system (as shown by high chemical index of alteration (CIA) values indicative of intensive chemical weathering) that was suboxic to anoxic (as shown by high U/Th ratios and trace-metal enrichment factors). The present chemistry of these claystones was thus controlled by a combination of parent rock type and diagenetic alteration.",
1558,"Toxic injustice in the Bangladesh water sector: a social inequities perspective on arsenic contamination Arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh poses a major environmental health hazard to millions. The efforts of public health programmes to address the problem have often been short-lived and unevenly distributed. The crisis represents a failure of governance and a structural injustice of global dimensions. Rights-based approaches to development have been proposed to address such problems. This paper explores the implications of framing the arsenic problem in terms of social justice and human rights. It describes the efforts of the Arsenic Mitigation and Research Foundation to implement drinking water supplies and health support schemes with marginalised communities. The approach was never explicitly framed as rights-based, but focuses instead on social mobilisation and on securing fundamental human needs. We argue that this will be conducive to social justice, which in turn creates the necessary space for pursuing human rights claims.",
1559,"Paleoproterozoic assembly of the North and South Tarim terranes: New insights from deep seismic profiles and Precambrian granite cores The basement of the Tarim Craton in NW China is divided into northern and southern terranes by the central 1500 km long Central Tarim Terrain (CTT) demarcated by a high aeromagnetic anomaly. However, the nature of the CTT remains enigmatic because of sparse data from basement below the deep basin. In this contribution we report new U-Pb ages from Precambrian granites from boreholes in the CTT to constrain the timing of the assembly of the northern and southern Tarim terranes. Zircon U-Pb ages from four samples of metagranite yielded four U-Pb ages of 1927.3 +/- 7.5 Ma and 1920.4 +/- 9.8 Ma, 1915.3 +/- 5.4 Ma and 1968 +/- 8.4 Ma along the CTT. Geochemically, the granitoids display high K2O and high K2O/Na2O ratios, showing their high-potassium calc-alkaline nature. They are rich in Ba, Sr, LREE and LILE, and depleted in Nb, Ta, Ti and Nd, Zr, Y, with variable negative Eu anomaly. The zircons have a large range of epsilon Hf(t) values (-14.6-16.1). Geochemical and isotopic characteristics suggest that the granites were derived from partial melting of crust and partial of the depleted mantle, and are geodynamically related to subduction in an arc setting. Collectively, our study argues that the assembly of the northern and southern Tarim terranes took place in the late Paleoproterozoic rather than the Neoproterozoic. We suggest that the amalgamation between the southern and northern terranes was completed by similar to 1.91 Ga, which led to extensive contemporaneous magmatism rather than the assembly with the Columbia supercontinent.",
1560,"[Occurrence and Spatial Distribution of Volatile Organic Compounds in Urban Drinking Water Distribution Systems] Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the urban drinking water distribution systems for two coastal cities (S City and L City) in China were analyzed. Health risk assessments of VOCs detected in tap water were performed, and the distribution characteristics of VOCs in the tap water pipe network were also investigated. Among 47 target VOCs, 16 compounds were detected, of which 11 were detected in both S City and L City. Halogenated hydrocarbons were the most commonly detected VOCs, with trihalomethanes (including bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) having the highest detection frequencies (92%-100%). With the exception of bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane, the maximum concentrations of detected VOCs in both cities complied with the relevant limits regulated by the standards for drinking water quality (GB 5749-2006). For bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane, not only did their concentrations exceed the standard limits of GB 5749-2006 (60 Î¼gÂ·L(-1) for bromodichloromethane and 100 Î¼gÂ·L(-1) for dibromochloromethane), but their lifetime cancer risks (LCR) were estimated at unacceptable levels (>10(-4)). Therefore, these two compounds should be given sufficient attention or be classified as priority control pollutants in municipal water supply networks. In addition, the spatial distribution of eight VOCs with high detection frequencies (>90%) in the tap water pipe network of S City was investigated. The concentrations of VOCs (excluding toluene) in this urban drinking water distribution system gradually decreased with increasing distance from the drinking water treatment plant.",
1561,"A novel process of the isolation of nitrifying bacteria and their development in two different natural lab-scale packed-bed bioreactors for trichloroethylene bioremediation Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a carcinogenic compound that is commonly present in groundwater and has been detected in drinking water sources for Mexican towns in the Mexico-US border area. Nitrifying bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas europaea, have been shown to be capable of degrading halogenated compounds, including TCE, but it is difficult to obtain high cell concentrations of these bacteria. The aim of the present study was to generate biomass of a nitrifying bacterial consortium from the sludge of an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and evaluate its capacity to biodegrade TCE in two different natural lab-scaled packed bed bioreactors. The consortium was isolated by a novel method using a continuous stirred-tank bioreactor inoculated with activated sludge from the Domos WWTP located in Cd. ObregÃ³n, Sonora, Mexico. The bioreactor was fed with specific media to cultivate ammonia-oxidizing bacteria at a dilution rate near the maximum specific growth rate reported for Nitrosomonas europaea. Optical density and suspended solids measurements were performed to determine the culture biomass production, and the presence of inorganic nitrogen species was determined by spectrophotometry. The presence of nitrifying ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was confirmed by PCR amplification, and biofilm formation was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Batch-scale experiments confirmed the biodegradative activity of the isolated consortium, which was subsequently fixed in an inorganic carrier as zeolite and a synthetic carrier such as polyurethane to both be used as lab-scale packed-bed bioreactors, with up to 58.63% and 62.7% of TCE biodegradation achieved, respectively, demonstrating a possible alternative for TCE bioremediation in environmental and engineering systems.",
1562,"Interventions to improve disposal of human excreta for preventing diarrhoea Background Diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, especially among young children in low-income countries, and are associated with exposure to human excreta. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve the disposal of human excreta for preventing diarrhoeal diseases. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); and Chinese-language databases available under the Wan Fang portal, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI-CAJ). We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, and contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, as well as checking references from identified studies. Selection criteria Randomized, quasi-randomized, and non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected, comparing interventions aimed at improving the disposal of human excreta to reduce direct or indirect human contact with no such intervention. Cluster (eg at the level of household or community) controlled trials were included. Data collection and analysis We determined study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality in accordance with the methods prescribed by the protocol. We described the results and summarized the information in tables. Due to substantial heterogeneity among the studies in terms of study design and type of intervention, no pooled effects were calculated. Main results Thirteen studies from six countries covering over 33,400 children and adults in rural, urban, and school settings met the review's inclusion criteria. In all studies the intervention was allocated at the community level. While the studies reported a wide range of effects, 11 of the 13 studies found the intervention was protective against diarrhoea. Differences in study populations and settings, in baseline sanitation levels, water, and hygiene practices, in types of interventions, study methodologies, compliance and coverage levels, and in case definitions and outcome surveillance limit the comparability of results of the studies included in this review. The validity of most individual study results are further compromised by the non-random allocation of the intervention among study clusters, an insufficient number of clusters, the lack of adjustment for clustering, unclear loss to follow-up, potential for reporting bias and other methodological shortcomings. Authors' conclusions This review provides some evidence that interventions to improve excreta disposal are effective in preventing diarrhoeal disease. However, this conclusion is based primarily on the consistency of the evidence of beneficial effects. The quality of the evidence is generally poor and does not allow for quantification of any such effect. The wide range of estimates of the effects of the intervention may be due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the studies, as well as to other important differences, including exposure levels, types of interventions, and different degrees of observer and respondent bias. Rigorous studies in multiple settings are needed to clarify the potential effectiveness of excreta disposal on diarrhoea.",
1563,"Development of an integrated method for long-term water quality prediction using seasonal climate forecast The APEC Climate Center (APCC) produces climate prediction information utilizing a multi-climate model ensemble (MME) technique. In this study, four different downscaling methods, in accordance with the degree of utilizing the seasonal climate prediction information, were developed in order to improve predictability and to refine the spatial scale. These methods include: (1) the Simple Bias Correction (SBC) method, which directly uses APCC's dynamic prediction data with a 3 to 6 month lead time; (2) the Moving Window Regression (MWR) method, which indirectly utilizes dynamic prediction data; (3) the Climate Index Regression (CIR) method, which predominantly uses observation-based climate indices; and (4) the Integrated Time Regression (ITR) method, which uses predictors selected from both CIR and MWR. Then, a sampling-based temporal downscaling was conducted using the Mahalanobis distance method in order to create daily weather inputs to the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Long-term predictability of water quality within theWecheon watershed of the Nakdong River Basin was evaluated. According to the Korean Ministry of Environment's Provisions of Water Quality Prediction and Response Measures, modeling-based predictability was evaluated by using 3-month lead prediction data issued in February, May, August, and November as model input of SWAT. Finally, an integrated approach, which takes into account various climate information and downscaling methods for water quality prediction, was presented. This integrated approach can be used to prevent potential problems caused by extreme climate in advance.",
1564,"Toxicity of the dispersant Corexit 9500 to early life stages of blue crab, Callinectes sapidus The Deepwater Horizon well released 4.4 million barrels of light crude oil offshore of Louisiana into one of the world's largest and most productive blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) fisheries. The objectives of this paper were to determine the toxicity of the dispersant Corexit(Â®) 9500A used in the 2010 oil spill on juvenile and larval blue crabs, and the long-term effects of sublethal acute exposure. Only the highest treatment levels of dispersant significantly increased mortality in larval and juvenile blue crabs (100 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L, respectively). This correlated to concentrations well above levels found in the Gulf of Mexico following the spill. Smaller and younger crabs showed higher mortality than older and larger crabs. This research indicates direct application of dispersants on crab larvae could cause acute mortality, but dilution through diffusion and natural weathering processes would minimize long-term effects.",
1565,"Determination of radon concentration in drinking water of Bam villages and evaluation of the annual effective dose Background: Radon is one of the most important radioactive elements which is released by natural decay of available uranium and radium in the ground. The presence of radon gas is common, wherever those faults are located there. Radon concentration of various drinking water resources of Bam villages; located near Bam fault; was measured. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the spring of 2014. Samples were collected from 27 water resources (wells and canals) as well as 5 water storage tanks of Bam villages of Kerman province. The radon concentrations were determined by RAD7 device. The annual absorbed dose was also calculated according to the measured radon levels. Results: The average of minimum radon concentration in water resources was 1.2 Bql=1; which was related to a water tank in Baravat; and the average of its maximum amount was calculated as 9.88 BqL(-1) which was related to a private home well in Baghchamak village. The maximum annual effective dose for adults was 30.82 p.Sylliand the lowest was calculated as 3.74 p.S011. Conclusion: Based on the achieved results, radon concentration of drinking water resources is lower than permitted concentration of EPA and also WHO guidelines.",
1566,"Deepwater technology: Past, present and future Hard times often act as a catalyst for change. Low rates of return and marginal new field economics have stimulated rather than hampered offshore technological innovation. Some would say that the state of our industry has stifled deepwater development programs and all but eliminated the incentive for continued development. Diverless and deepwater technology has thrived in this environment as the search for economically viable fields moves into the vast, unexploited deepwater areas. Drilling continues in ultra deepwater in the ocean margin drilling program (plans for 10 060 m (33 000 ft) to learn more of plate tectonics and continental drift. Weâ€™re drilling for oil and gas in 2286 m (7500 ft) of water using state-of-the-art dynamically positioned drilling technology. We forge aheadâ€”with caution, yes,â€”but move ahead nevertheless. Shellâ€™s aggressive drilling program in the Gulf of Mexico, Placidâ€™s Green Canyon large-scale production facilities, Conocoâ€™s Jolliet Project in the Gulf of Mexico and Petrobrasâ€™ string of record water depth completions offshore Brazil have all evolved during these very tenuous times. Long-term opportunities appear promising, with major operators having leased acreage in up to 3048 m (10 000 ft) of water in the Gulf of Mexico during the last two years. Enormous deepwater projects such as Troll are underway in Norway, which will extend well into the 21st century and will provide major impetus for continuing innovation. The crystal ball is not clear, but it is accepted that flat oil prices will be with us for some time. The key to the near term is fine tuning, examining our present accomplishments and searching for simplification. Excessive complexity leads to inoperable systems at any depth. Safety and reliability must continue to be a crucial element in the formula. Industry can solve the problemsâ€”we have done soâ€”we have adapted systems to meet the water depth challenges put to us by the geologists over the years. However, economics are and will continue to be the controlling factorâ€”they are the driving force. This chapter will touch on key milestones in the development of deepwater technology and suggest how these relate to mid-depth applications. Achievement of these milestones has periodically redefined 'deepwater' for the industry and now provides us with a historical reference for viewing our present efforts. Those past 'deepwater' developments are today's mid-depth production systems. The future will be highly influenced by the approach we, the industry as a whole, take in developing new technologies Just as the 'deepwater' developments of the past have become the mid-depth production systems of today, the developments that will get us to 3048 m (10 000 ft) will substantially influence our approach to cost-effective development of reserves in conventional water depths.

1567,"Pharmaceutical compounds in tributaries of the Han River watershed, South Korea The Han River watershed is the largest and most important source of drinking water for the residents of the Seoul metropolitan area and the Gyeonggi province in South Korea. The tributaries of the watershed are vulnerable to contamination by effluents from nearby wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and non-point sources. In this study, a one-year monitoring study was performed to investigate the occurrence of 13 pharmaceuticals in 24 tributaries of the Han River watershed in October 2015. From the 13 pharmaceuticals, 12 were found in at least one sample, with the exception of chlortetracycline, which was not detected. The three most frequently detected compounds were clarithromycin (95.8%), carbamazepine (66.7%), and lincomycin (62.5%). Compounds found in high concentrations included clarithromycin (5.2675Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)), ibuprofen (1.9646Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)), and carbamazepine (1.1009Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)). The total concentration of 12 pharmaceuticals in the Seoul metropolitan area (0.7128Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)) was higher than that in the Gyeonggi area (0.3177Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)) possibly due to the large-scale WWTPs located upstream. However, in IHR-3, which is located at the very upstream of the tributary and is not impacted by a WWTP, pharmaceuticals were not detected. This can be explained by the fact that most pharmaceuticals derived from WWTPs are related to human activity. The risk quotients (RQs) for the target pharmaceuticals were calculated on the basis of their presence in tributaries, and all pharmaceuticals presented RQsÂ <Â 0.01, indicating that potential environmental impacts should be low. These results will be useful to monitor and assess the potential environmental risks of pharmaceuticals in the surface water.",
1568,"Mohenjo Daro and the River Indus The unique importance of Mohenjo Daro isreviewed, together with a critical assessment of developments in the exploration of the site since its discovery by Sir John Marshall in the 1920s and subsequent exploration by Sir Mortimer Wheeler and others, including the author. The city was a huge densely populated one largely constructed of bricks similar in many respects to those in use today. Most houses were supplied with water from wells some of which may have been up to 25 metres deep, and most of the houses were connected by street drains which carried away water from the bathing platforms. The density of the wells within the city-with a mean distance of about 35 metres between them-is startling. All of this, and particularly the use of bricks, suggests a highly rationalized economy and technology that may have been unique for the time. For its time the city must have been almost unique in extending to at least 300 hectares and homing approximately 40,000 people. Present day conservation of the site suffers from erosion, and this was probably a problem from the time that the city was first built. The city is almost entirely built of alluvial material (mud bricks) from the immediate surroundings, and so water was the most serious enemy of the city, as well as providing a source of water for the population. Recent research by the author and co-workers has shown the existence, and the extent of the huge mud-brick retaining walls which with the raised nature of the site protected the city from the annual floods and inundations of the Indus River. One of the most important inventions which separates the early from the mature Harappan building technology was the use of burnt brick as a building material. This was used as a foundation layer of walls to stabilize them against rising ground water. Industrial kiln waste (terracotta nodules, bangles, brick pieces) were also used as damp proof layers and levelling layers beneath burnt brick walls. Water was in daily use in the city both within each house and in the extraordinary building of the great bath. Wells, like elevaton platforms and burnt brick structures are indicators of the alluvial setting of the city. The existence of so many wells also indicates the scarcity of readily available surface water in spite of the proximity of the Indus River, as the wells would have tapped the ground water at some depth below the surface of the ground. Recent evidence suggests that the city may have been founded as a fully planned city close to the Indus based on extraordinary engineering technology, rather than having developed from earlier ones on the same site. This new metropolis city was not a city based on farming (Ackerburgerstadt). It was associated with a general move towards alluvial rivers in the late fourth and early third millennium, and its development was probably related to a transport revolution at that time involving the general intensification, and rationalization of the use of water and ships. The waterways can then be envisaged as traffic routes that maintained a complex communication and exchange system between a centre or centres such as that at Mohenjo Daro, and peripheral settlements. The geographical arrangement between the centres and the peripheral settlements in the Sindh valley is not yet clear. However the extraordinary efforts required to decide, plan, finance and execute such an enormous undertaking as Mohenjo Daro suggest that the siting of the city was dictated by the primary role of the Indus as a communication backbone and possibly also by the crossing of the west-east trade route from Quetta to the Rohri Hills (Kot Diji?) at that point. Future research should include studies of the extent and nature of the Mohenjo Daro complex and identification of its horizontal and vertical limits; investigations of the nature of the soil and sedimentary horizons both within the city and around its periphery in relation to the course of the Indus; and the relationship between Mohenjo Daro and other sites in the area of what is now Pakistan and its surrounding co ntries.",
1569,"DETECTION OF MULTILAYER CAVITIES BY EMPLOYING RC-DTH AIR HAMMER SYSTEM AND CAVITY AUTO SCANNING LASER SYSTEM The subterranean cavities are seriously threatened to construction and mining safety, and it's important to obtain the exact localization and dimensions of subterranean cavities for the planning of geotechnical and mining activities. Geophysical investigation is an alternative method for cavity detection, but it usually failed for the uncertainly solution of information and data obtained by Geophysical methods. Drilling is considered as the most accurate method for cavity detection. However, the conventional drilling methods can only be used for single cavity detection, and there is no effective solution for multilayer cavities detection have been reported. In this paper, a reverse circulation (RC) down-the-hole (DTH) air hammer system with a special structured drill bit is built and a cavity auto scanning laser system based on laser range finding technique was employed to confirm the localization and dimensions of the cavities. This RC-DTH air hammer system allows drilling through the upper cavities and putting the cavity auto scanning laser system into the cavity area through the central passage of the drill tools to protect the detection system from collapsing of borehole wall. The RC-DTH air hammer system was built, and field tests were conducted in Lanxian County Iron Ore District, which is located in Lv Liang city of Shan Xi province, the northwest of china. Field tests show that employing the RC-DTH air hammer system assisted by the cavity auto scanning laser system is an efficiency method to detect multilayer cavities.",

1571,"Beyond the networks: Self-help services and post-settlement network extensions in the periphery of Dar es Salaam This paper offers insights from comprehensive case studies of rapidly growing peripheral settlements of Dar es Salaam. The paper explores how a broad range of services and infrastructures have developed and improved over time, and how residents have been engaged in this in various ways. The gradual improvements in services and infrastructure are to some extent created, organized and financed by residents through informal self-help solutions, which are often costly and place huge strains on residents' time and resources. Alongside this, residents are also involved in attracting formal service providers through applications, co-financing of network extensions as well as lobbying efforts towards urban authorities and service providers. The formal service providers primarily take a reactive role, responding to demand, requests and political pressure from residents. Post-settlement network extensions are often complicated and impeded by costly and cumbersome land-acquisition processes, and because of the reactive and often piecemeal approach to network extensions, society may be missing out on potential benefits of scale. The way urban services work also means that the provision of services and infrastructure is extremely differentiated and fragmented across the urban territory, creating and reinforcing major inequalities in access to services.

1572,"The Effects of Lithology on Water Pollution: Natural Radioactivity and Trace Elements in Water Resources of Eskisehir Region (Turkey) The high radioactivity and trace elements in drinking water are common concerns for human health. The aim of this study was to investigate the eligibility of groundwater for drinking purpose in terms of both radioactivity and trace element contents in Eskisehir Region (Turkey). The study area is located in a highly populated residential area where water supply is mostly met from groundwater. The area is about 20,000 km(2), where igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks are exposed. The 209 water samples collected from 84 water resources (including thermal waters) were analyzed with respect to major ions, trace elements, and radioactivity (gross alpha and gross beta) during both in wet and dry seasons. Based on the analysis results, trace elements in 49 samples of 84 water resources were over the limits of Code TS 266 1997 (Turkish Drinking Water Standards) and WHO 1993 standards. Particularly, Fe, Mn, Al, As, Ba, Zn, Cr, Cu, and B ion concentrations exceeded the limits. The gross alpha values in 18 locations and gross beta values in three locations also exceeded the limits of aforementioned standards in terms of radioactivity (gross alpha = 0.1 Bq L-1; gross beta = 1 Bq L-1). Furthermore, water radioactivity levels were close to the allowable limits in 33 water resources. The obtained results explicitly indicate that there is a strong relationship between the higher radioactivity-trace element contents and geochemical composition of rocks, which controls the radioactivity and trace element concentrations present in the aquifer.",
1573,"Climate change impacts on crop yield, crop water productivity and food security - A review This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature related to the assessment of climate change impacts on crop productivity using climate, water and crop yield models. The existing studies present that climate change models with higher spatial resolution can be a way forward for future climate projections. Meanwhile, stochastic projections of more than one climate model are necessary for providing insights into model uncertainties as well as to develop risk management strategies. It is projected that water availability will increase in some parts of the world, which will have its own effect on water use efficiency and water allocation. Crop production can increase if irrigated areas are expanded or irrigation is intensified, but these may increase the rate of environmental degradation. Since climate change impacts on soil water balance will lead to changes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, consequently, the crop growth period may shorten in the future impacting on water productivity. Crop yields affected by climate change are projected to be different in various areas, in some areas crop yields will increase, and for other areas it will decrease depending on the latitude of the area and irrigation application. Existing modelling results show that an increase in precipitation will increase crop yield, and what is more, crop yield is more sensitive to the precipitation than temperature. If water availability is reduced in the future, soils of high water holding capacity will be better to reduce the impact of drought while maintaining crop yield. With the temperature increasing and precipitation fluctuations, water availability and crop production are likely to decrease in the future. If the irrigated areas are expanded, the total crop production will increase; however, food and environmental quality may degrade.

1574,"Production, purification and characterization of raw starch hydrolyzing thermostable acidic Î±-amylase from hot springs, India Alpha-amylase is an important hydrolytic enzyme used for various industrial processes. In the present study, Geobacillus bacterium (K1C), producing a thermostable Î±-amylase was isolated from Manikaran hot springs, India. We have purified and characterized the biochemical properties of Î±-amylase. The optimum temperature and pH for Î±-amylase activity was 80â€¯Â°C and pHâ€¯6.0 respectively. The far-UV CD spectra of the enzyme indicated the presence of random coil conformation and showed an intermediate phase during temperature-induced unfolding. In the presence of substrate, thermostability of the Î±-amylase was increased as 50% initial activity was retained at 70â€¯Â°C for 6â€¯h and at 80â€¯Â°C for 2â€¯h. Moreover, the enzyme also showed remarkable pH stability as 90% of the initial activity was retained even after 48â€¯h of incubation at pHâ€¯5.0, 6.0 and 7.0. Interestingly, amylase activity of the purified enzyme was Ca(2+)independent, whereas the complete inhibition of activity was observed in the presence of Cu(2+), Pb(2+), and Hg(2+). The purified Î±-amylase was stable in the presence of detergents, organic solvents and Proteinase K. Furthermore, it exhibited the ability to hydrolyze raw starches (e.g. rice, wheat, corn, potato) efficiently; thus this enzyme has the potential to be used for industrial applications.",
1575,"The Formation and Evolution of Uvarovite in UHP Serpentinite and Rodingite and its Constraints on Chromium Mobility in the Oceanic Subduction Zone The uvarovite-andradite and uvarovite-andradite-grossular solid-solution series are rare in nature. The discovery of uvarovite-andradite in serpentinite and rodingite from the ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt in southwestern Tianshan provided an opportunity to investigate its behavior in the subduction zone. Uvarovite (defined as chromium-garnet) from serpentinite is homogeneous in a single grain, covering compositions in the uvarovite-andradite solid solution series of Adr(58-66)Uv(33-41), with few grossular components. Uvarovite from rodingites contain various Cr2O3 contents (1.7-17.9 wt%) and mineral compositions being in the range of Adr(21-31)Uv(41-50)Grs(22-37), Adr(52-90)Uv(5-25)Grs(0-21) and Adr(19-67)Uv(3-63)Grs(13-42). Discontinuous chemical variation of uvarovite from core to rim indicates that uvarovite formed by consuming andradite and chromite, which could provide Ca, Cr, Al and Fe. Raman signals of water were identified for uvarovite from both serpentinite and rodingite, with high water content in uvarovite from serpentinite. The high pressure mineral assemblage, as well as the association with perovskite, indicated that the studied uvarovite from serpentinite and rodingite was formed through high pressure metamorphism, during the subduction zone serpentinization and rodingitization. High alkaline and highly reduced fluids released from serpentinization or rodingitization in the oceanic subduction zone promote the mobility of chromium and enable its long-distance migration.",
1576,"Rutile in the UHP eclogites from the CCSD main drillhole (Donghai, eastern China): Trace-element geochemistry and metallogenetic implications Rutile is a common Ti-bearing accessory mineral in eclogites. In the 100 similar to 2000m borehole samples of the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Project, rutile appears more or less in rutile eclogite, phengite eclogite and kyanite eclogite. It is mainly included in major metamorphic minerals, or as intergranular grains between them. When eclogite suffered amphibolite-facies retrograde metamorphism, rutile was often retrograded to produce sphene aureole. Apart from the major components, trace elements such as Nb, Cr and Zr are measured by electron microprobe with specific operating conditions. Rutiles contain on average 147ppm Nb with the maximum 670ppm, while the average Cr content is 614ppm with the maximum value of 3630ppm. Overall, low Nb concentrations in rutile (< 1000ppm) indicate a mafic source-rock for the eclogites. Additionally, three types of eclogites are also distinguishable on the basis of their Nb, Cr concentrations. Rutiles from the rutile eclogites display low Cr (< 500ppm) and variable Nb contents (0 similar to 670ppm), and those from the phengite eclogites are characterized by moderate Cr (500 similar to 1200ppm) and also variable Nb (0 similar to 480ppm). Rutiles from kyanite eclogites are diagnostic, being highly enriched in Cr (2000 similar to 3630ppm) but very poor in Nb (< 140ppm). Although Zr is very low in rutile, most of Zr contents range between 150 and 240ppm with an average of 200ppm. The highest Zr contents of each samples is used to estimate formation temperature of rutiles, based on a new Zr-in-rutile geothermometer proposed by Zack et al. (2004), which vary from 690 degrees C to 787 degrees C. The study shows that trace-element geochemistry can serve as a potential tool for provenance of eclogites and for estimation of temperature of associated Ti mineralization.",
1577,"CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE MINERAL MATTER OF THE ATTARAT UM GHUDRAN OIL SHALE, CENTRAL JORDAN The concession area of the Jordan Oil Shale Energy Co (JOSE) is located in the southern border zone of the Attarat Um Ghudran deposit, next to the Wadi Maghara deposit, both consisting of marinite type oil shale (OS). These deposits of the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Paleogene Muwaqqar Chalk-Marl Formation form a huge north-southward elongated oil shale basin in Central Jordan, with resources over 55 billion tons. JOSE has drilled a regular grid of boreholes with a full coring of the up to 90 m thick OS seam and its lower and upper contact layers. Visually, the OS unit is a rather homogenous dark-colored (grey, black, brownish grey) succession of finely bedded (laminated) kerogen-bearing carbonate rocks that has been in earlier papers described as a uniform lithological unit. The aim of the geological and lithological studies of the JOSE exploration area was (i) to investigate the vertical variation of OS composition and, if present, to define layers within the OS unit, and (ii) to identify lithological varieties and chemical composition of OS present in different layers. On the basis of field evidence, downhole gamma-logging, chemical analyses and other criteria, an original detailed scheme of the layered structure of oil shale and barren rocks was introduced. A total of eight OS layers (indexed as A, B1, B2, C, D, E1, E2, E3) and at least four barren dolomitic limestone interlayers were distinguished. The present publication is dedicated to the chemical study of the layers and the total OS seam. A representative gapless collection of 632 conventional core samples from 12 cores serves as the base for the comparative study of the layers. Two main (SiO2, CaO) and two subordinate chemical (Al2O3 and P2O5) components of the mineral matter (MM), and loss on ignition (LOI 500 degrees C) approximately reflecting the content of organic matter (OM), are the basic variables discussed. Contents of SiO2 and CaO always show negative correlation, whereas local enrichment with Al2O3 and P2O5 occurs in certain interbeds. OM content in samples has no strong correlation with mineral matter abundances. The eight distinguished OS layers comprise both those strongly enriched in CaO, or oppositely in SiO2. The layers differ in rate of internal heterogeneity reflected in variation of standard deviation values. With rare exceptions, the barren limestone interlayers are dolomitized, strongly enriched with MgO and depleted of CaO. The database on the distribution of mineral compounds and trace elements serves for the 3-D block modelling of the deposit composition. However, further data analysis is required for the understanding of lateral changes of the layers' mineral composition, and geological and geochemical structure.",
1578,"Canopy scale measurements of CO2 and water vapor exchange along a precipitation gradient in southern Africa Short-term measurements of carbon dioxide, water, and energy fluxes were collected at four locations along a mean annual precipitation gradient in southern Africa during the wet (growing) season with the purpose of determining how the observed vegetation-atmosphere exchange properties are functionally related to the long-term climatic conditions. This research was conducted along the Kalahari Transect (KT), one in the global set of International Geosphere-Biosphere Program transects, which covers a north-south aridity gradient, all on a homogenous sand formation. Eddy covariance instruments were deployed on a permanent tower in Mongu, Zambia (879 mm of rainfall per year), as well as on a portable tower in Maun (460 mm yr-1), Okwa River Crossing (407 mm yr -1), and Tshane (365 mm yr-1), Botswana for several days at each site. The relationships between CO2, flux, Fc, and photosynthetically active radiation were described well by a hyperbolic fit to the data at all locations except for Mongu, the wettest site. Here, there appeared to be an air temperature effect on Fc. While daytime values of Fc routinely approached or exceeded -20 Î¼mol m -2 s -1 at Mongu, the magnitude of Fc remained less than - 10 Î¼mol m 2 s-1 when the air temperature was above 27 Â°C. Canopy resistances to water vapor transfer, rc, displayed an overall decline from the wetter sites to the more arid sites, but the differences in rc could be almost exclusively accounted for by the decrease in leaf area index (LAI) from north to south along the KT. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of net carbon flux to evapotranspiration, showed a general decrease with increasing vapor pressure deficit, D, for all of the sites. The magnitudes of WUE at a given D, however, were dissimilar for the individual sites and were found to be stratified according to the position of the sites along the long-term aridity gradient. For example, Mongu, which has the wettest climate, has a much lower WUE for like levels of D than Tshane, which historically has the most arid climate. Given the similar inferred stomatal resistances between the sites, the disparate carbon uptake behavior for the grass vs. woody vegetation is the likely cause for the observed differences in WUE along the aridity gradient. The short-term flux measurements provide a framework for evaluating the vegetation's functional adaptation to the long-term climate and provide information that may be useful for predicting the dynamic response of the vegetation to future climate change.

1579,"Water leakage investigation of micro-dam reservoirs in Mesozoic sedimentary sequences in Northern Ethiopia Millions of people throughout the world depend on dam reservoirs for domestic water supply, irrigation, electricity and flood protection. In the last two decades, 54 micro-dam reservoirs have been constructed in Northern Ethiopia to fight the recurrent drought and improve agricultural productivity through irrigation. However, about 60% of these micro-dam reservoirs are suffering from excessive leakage. Comprehensive studies have been carried out on two micro-dams to assess and pinpoint the causes of leakage. Arato and Hashenge micro-dams located in Northern Ethiopia have 20 m and 19 m height, and 2.59 Mm(3) and 2.23 Mm(3) reservoir capacities respectively. Observational geological description, shallow hand dug test pits, vertical electrical sounding and drilling of geotechnical holes were used to understand the overall geological, engineering geological and geo-hydrological set-up of the area. The different methods applied, such as discontinuity analysis, geophysical surveys, drilling and packer tests, delivered results that were found to be in close agreement and led to the identification of the leakage zone. The geological units found in both sites are limestone-shale-marl intercalation, dolerite and recent soil deposits. The research results revealed that the limestone-shale-marl intercalation unit is heterogeneous and shows alternating sequences. Analysis of the different data shows that the limestone-shale-marl intercalation is a pervious unit (hydraulic conductivity in the range of 10(-4)-10(+2) cm/s) and was found to be responsible for the excessive leakage of the micro-dams. It is hoped that the observations, data and insights gathered from these case studies will enable to plan technically and economically viable anti-leakage measures for these schemes and help for future new site selection and design activities in the region and other regions with a similar geological environment.

1580,"COVID-19 Pandemic Consequences on Coastal Water Quality Using WST Sentinel-3 Data: Case of Tangier, Morocco The west coast of Tangier, in northern Morocco, has been affected by industrial wastewater discharge that reaches the ocean through the Boukhalef river. Therefore, the Jbila and Sidikacem beaches near to the Boukhalef river mouth have been classified as polluted for many years. With the aim of determining the COVID-19 pandemic consequences on the Tangier coastal environment, a linear model using Sentinel 3 water surface temperature (WST) has been tested in several locations. Data from April 2019 and April 2020, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic related emergency status in Morocco, were compared. The results from April 2019 showed high WST values and consequently, the poorest water quality in the sites closest to the Boukhalef river mouth. On the other hand, the results from April 2020 showed normal WST values and high water quality in the same study area. These results illustrate the usefulness of Sentinel 3 WST for the estimation of bathing water quality on the west coast of Tangier. The study shows the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic consequences on the coastal environment quality in the study area and indicates the importance of decreasing the industrial discharge on the west coast of Tangier. The same methodology could be used in decision-making processes and to reduce cost, time and human resources for coastal monitoring systems. We demonstrate the potential of using the Sentinel 3 data for coastal waters monitoring, as well as the need for stricter controls of pollutant discharges into the world's rivers.",
1581,"Spatial variation of 2,4-D and MCPA in tap water and groundwater from China and their fate in source, treated, and tap water from Wuhan, Central China Data on chlorophenoxy herbicides (CPHs) in drinking water from China are scarce. This study was designed to describe the occurrence of CPHs in drinking water in China. In June 2019, drinking water samples including 789 tap water and 95 groundwater samples were collected from 31 provinces in mainland China and Hong Kong. Raw source, treated, and tap water samples (nÂ =Â 20, 20, and 170, respectively) in Wuhan, Central China were also analyzed. 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) were found in 71.2% and 74.9% of the samples nationwide, respectively. The cumulative concentration of CPHs (Î£CPHs) in tap water in China was up to 125Â ng/L (median: 1.38Â ng/L), and regional variations were found for Î£CPHs. The highest median Î£CPHs (3.95Â ng/L) was found in Northeast China, followed by Central (3.40), South (2.71), East (2.43), Southwest (1.58), North (0.42), and Northwest China (0.30). The median Î£CPHs in groundwater was approximately five times lower than that in tap water. In addition, Î£CPHs were found in all the raw source water samples collected in Wuhan, Central China (median: 6.69Â ng/L, range: 2.66-43.1Â ng/L). The removal of 2,4-D and MCPA during conventional drinking water treatment was not efficient, removing approximately 0.91% and 17.4%, respectively. In a water plant with advanced treatment, they were efficiently removed. Seasonal variations were found in Î£CPHs in tap water from Wuhan, with the highest found in July (median: 21.2Â ng/L), and the lowest in October (1.96 ng/L). The intake of CPHs via water ingestion was estimated as below 5Â ng/kg-bw/day, much lower than the reference doses for 2,4-D (5Â Î¼g/kg-bw/day) and MCPA (4Â Î¼g/kg-bw/day). This is the first study to demonstrate the fate of CPHs during drinking water treatment and seasonal variations of CPHs in water from Wuhan, China. Moreover, this study provides an overview of Î£CPHs in tap water for many areas in China.",
1582,"Estimation of concentration and exposure doses due to radon by using CR-39 plastic track detectors in the residences of Sudhnuti, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan This paper presents the results of indoor radon concentration measurements in 120 dwellings of district Sudhnuti of Azad Kashmir. Measurements were taken with CR-39 passive alpha track detector. CR-39 based box type radon detectors were installed in a bedroom and living rooms of each house. The detectors were retrieved after exposing to indoor radon for period of 6 months and then etched in 6 M NaOH at 80A degrees C for 16 h, the observed track densities were converted in to the indoor radon concentration. Indoor radon concentration varied from 20 +/- A 12 to 170 +/- A 4 Bq m(-3) for the houses of the district Sudhnuti. Arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM) and geometric standard deviations (GSD) were found to be 82 +/- A 6, 77 +/- A 6 and 1.51, respectively. The minimum value of weighted average radon concentration was recorded in one of the house of Mang town, whereas the maximum value was found in the Pattan Sher Khan region. Doses due to indoor radon exposure vary from 0.50 +/- A 0.31 to 4.28 +/- A 0.11 mSv year(-1) AM, GM and GSD. of mean effective doses were found to be 2.06 +/- A 0.13, 1.95 +/- A 0.18 and 1.51, respectively. According to the recommendations made by the Health Protection Agency, UK (200 Bq m(-3)) all the houses surveyed are within the safe limits.",
1583,"Human health risk assessment: Study of a population exposed to fluoride through groundwater of Agra city, India Fluoride (F(-)), a harmful compound if present in high concentration, is typically found in groundwater. It is important to investigate the F(-) concentrations in groundwaters of areas where individuals use groundwater for drinking purposes. The objectives of this study were: (a) to estimate the F(-) exposure, and (b) to assess the non-carcinogenic risk through consumption of groundwater among urban population (different age groups) of Agra city. A total of 28 groundwater samples were collected from Agra city in May 2016, which comprised 22 samples from hand pump and 6 samples from tube wells from shallow aquifers at different sites. The F(-) concentrations varied from 0.90 to 4.12â€¯mg/L with an average value of 1.88â€¯mg/L. The results obtained reveal that about 64% of the samples exceeded the F(-) permissible limit of 1.5â€¯mg/L. Nevertheless, 32% of the samples were well within the WHO drinking water guidelines and 3.5% of the samples from the groundwater were below the 1.0â€¯mg/L threshold. The maximum estimated exposure doses were 0.69, 0.31 and 0.12â€¯mg/kg/day for infants, children and adults, respectively. A dental fluorosis becomes evident when the results obtained are compared with an oral reference dose of 0.06â€¯mg/kg/day. The hazard quotient (HQ) was found to be more than 1 for infants and children in all the studied areas which indicates that young consumers are more vulnerable to non-carcinogenic risk due to exposure of F(-). On the other hand, the adults at about 71% of the sampled sites may be victims of non-carcinogenic risk. From the results obtained in this study, it is recommended that there be implementation of the appropriate remediation for defluoridation of water to circumvent the population from the probable health risks of F(-).",
1584,"Soil carbon dynamics during grass restoration on abandoned sloping cropland in the hilly area of the Loess Plateau, China Secondary vegetation succession on abandoned cropland significantly influences soil C-pool dynamics in arid and semi-arid region. Much work on soil C-pool dynamics has been focused on soil organic carbon (SOC), whereas considerably less attention has been given on soil inorganic carbon (SIC). Moreover, the relationship between SOC and SIC during natural succession is unclear. The objective of this research was to investigate SOC and SIC storage dynamics in natural restored grassland following cropland abandonment. We measured SOC and SIC content in paired grassland and cropland sites in the Gaoqiao watershed on the Loess Plateau, China. The grassland sites were established on cropland abandoned for 5, 13, 24, and 32 years. Top soil OC was significantly higher after 10-year restoration, especially in the 0-5 cm soil depths; deeper soil OC was lower in younger grasslands (<20 yr), and significantly higher in older grasslands (>20 yr). SIC was significantly higher after abandonment, but varied largely among successional grasslands. SOC storage (SOCs) decreased in the younger grassland (5 yr), and SOCs (0-100 cm) was significantly higher after 10-year restoration. SIC storage (SICs) increased after abandonment in the 0-100 cm soil depth, but showed various magnitudes among restored grasslands. SIC storage (SICs) originally contained most part of SIC storage (STCs), and grass restoration after cropland abandonment led to higher SOCs/STCs ratio and lower SICs/STCs ratio. Our results indicate that grass restoration enhanced the accumulation of SOC and SIC storages, but with inverse proportional contributions to SIC storage. We suggest that SIC should be as much focused as SOC during grass restoration in the arid Loess Plateau. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1585,"Application of low-temperature thermochronology to hydrothermal ore deposits: Formation, preservation and exhumation of epithermal gold systems from the Eastern Rhodopes, Bulgaria New low-temperature thermochronological data have been used to quantify the protracted, Eocene-Miocene cooling histories of upper and lower plate rocks of the Kesebir-Kardamos extensional dome, Eastern Rhodopes, Bulgaria. Ar-40/Ar-39 and apatite fission-track data reveal that the lower plate has experienced continuous cooling and exhumation, since the Late Eocene. Muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages of 36.90 +/- 0.16 Ma and 37.28 +/- 0.19 Ma (2 sigma) from metamorphic rocks of the footwall reveal the approximate time span during which they cooled below similar to 350 degrees C during exhumation caused by detachment faulting. The sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization, which represents a thermal event at similar to 250-220 degrees C, developed during the early stage of basin formation between 34.71 +/- 0.16 Ma and 35.36 +/- 0.21 Ma (adularia Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages; 2 sigma). The termination of hydrothermal mineral deposition at Ada Tepe Occurred contemporaneously with the earliest phase of calc-alkaline type magmatism at Iran Tepe (33.97 +/- 0.36 Ma to 34.62 +/- 0.46 Ma, hornblende and biotite Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages, 2 sigma). Thermal history modelling of apatite fission-track data shows that the lower plate rocks cooled through similar to 120 degrees C at similar to 18.3 +/- 1.9 Ma (1 sigma). A time-temperature model obtained from zircon and apatite fission-track data from the upper plate reveals that it was being buried during the late Eocene. At similar to 33-30 Ma, a dramatic change of the time-temperature path was caused by the initiation of horst-graben structures, resulting in rapid exhumation of the upper plate. Our new thermochronological data reveal many aspects of the mechanisms of formation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits. The heat accumulated during sedimentary burial of the upper plate is a plausible heat source to drive hydrothermal fluid circulation and ore formation. The development of large half-graben basins in the hanging walls of detachment faults, accompanied by a favourable climate, may have created a situation that was adequate to Capture a primary meteoric water supply that subsequently underwent hydrothermal convection. Our new Ar-40/Ar-39 age data indicate that magmatic activity was contemporaneous with gold deposition and must be considered as a source of heat, sulphur and/or a metal far the ore-forming hydrothermal system. The preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted ore deposits is largely controlled by the exhumation history of the upper plate, which has been quantitatively constrained by low-temperature thermochronological methods, and commences with rapid exhumation at similar to 33-30 Ma.

1586,"Bacterial Proliferation in Municipal Water Supplied in Mirpur Locality of Dhaka City, Bangladesh Water related environmental pollution has long been a major concern not only in Bangladesh but also in other developing countries. Present study assessed the pathogenic prevalence in municipal water supplied across Mirpur zone, Dhaka, and its subsequent health impact on the local community. Elevated numbers of pathogenic bacteria including Aeromonas spp., Shigella spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Salmonella spp. were found in the consumer points (n=30) compared to that of the supply points (n=10). Additionally, proliferation of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. was monitored among the consumer points and not in the supply points. Drug resistance was scored against ampicillin (10Î¼g), ciprofloxacin (5Î¼g), ceftriazone (30Î¼g), penicillin (10Î¼g), nalidixic acid (30Î¼g), and vancomycin (30Î¼g). Hence, the municipal water of the study area was microbiologically unsafe, and the propagation of drug resistant strains was assumed to escalate the public health threat. A survey on public opinions was also conducted to evidently chalk out the impact of municipal water on the specific community studied. A simplistic way of gathering information on the pathogenic prevalence along the water distribution system was designed. The detection of drug-resistant pathogens in the municipal water supply points would further aid in the effective treatment during water borne disease outbreaks as well as may be included in the supply water monitoring curriculum at regular intervals.

1587,"Biological efficacy and toxic effect of emergency water disinfection process based on advanced oxidation technology An innovative and removable water treatment system consisted of strong electric field discharge and hydrodynamic cavitation based on advanced oxidation technologies was developed for reactive free radicals producing and waterborne pathogens eliminating in the present study. The biological efficacy and toxic effects of this advanced oxidation system were evaluated during water disinfection treatments. Bench tests were carried out with synthetic microbial-contaminated water, as well as source water in rainy season from a reservoir of Dalian city (Liaoning Province, China). Results showed that high inactivation efficiency of Escherichia coli (>5 log) could be obtained for synthetic contaminated water at a low concentration (0.5-0.7 mg L(-1)) of total oxidants in 3-10 s. The numbers of wild total bacteria (108 Ã— 10(3) CFU mL(-1)) and total coliforms (260 Ã— 10(2) MPN 100 mL(-1)) in source water greatly reduced to 50 and 0 CFU mL(-1) respectively after treated by the advanced oxidation system, which meet the microbiological standards of drinking water, and especially that the inactivation efficiency of total coliforms could reach 100%. Meanwhile, source water qualities were greatly improved during the disinfection processes. The values of UV254 in particular were significantly reduced (60-80%) by reactive free radicals. Moreover, the concentrations of possible disinfection by-products (formaldehyde and bromide) in treated water were lower than detection limits, indicating that there was no harmful effect on water after the treatments. These investigations are helpful for the ecotoxicological studies of advanced oxidation system in the treatments of chemical polluted water or waste water. The findings of this work suggest that the developed water treatment system is ideal in the acute phases of emergencies, which also could offer additional advantages over a wide range of applications in water pollution control.",
1588,"Inorganic arsenic levels in baby rice are of concern Inorganic arsenic is a chronic exposure carcinogen. Analysis of UK baby rice revealed a median inorganic arsenic content (n=17) of 0.11 mg/kg. By plotting inorganic arsenic against total arsenic, it was found that inorganic concentrations increased linearly up to 0.25 mg/kg total arsenic, then plateaued at 0.16 mg/kg at higher total arsenic concentrations. Inorganic arsenic intake by babies (4-12 months) was considered with respect to current dietary ingestion regulations. It was found that 35% of the baby rice samples analysed would be illegal for sale in China which has regulatory limit of 0.15 mg/kg inorganic arsenic. EU and US food regulations on arsenic are non-existent. When baby inorganic arsenic intake from rice was considered, median consumption (expressed as microg/kg/d) was higher than drinking water maximum exposures predicted for adults in these regions when water intake was expressed on a bodyweight basis.",

1590,"Pupal-productivity surveys to identify the key container habitats of Aedes aegypti (L.) in Barranquilla, the principal seaport of Colombia Surveys were conducted in three neighbourhoods of Barranquilla, the main seaport of Colombia, to identify, using counts of pupae in water containers during the wet and dry seasons, the most productive Aedes aegypti breeding sites. Overall, 3433 premises were investigated in the wet season and 3563 in the dry, representing, respectively, 82.3% and 84.6% of the total numbers of premises in the study areas. Despite a reasonably reliable supply of piped water, there were still some large storage containers for domestic water (cement ground tanks and plastic, metal and cement drums) in the area. Although such containers represented only 1.8%-16.3% of the total number of containers observed, they contributed 72.0%-78.2% and 65.0%-95.8% of the total Ae. aegypti pupal population in the three study neighbourhoods during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. In contrast, bottles represented 23.0%-88.9% of the total number of containers but produced no more than 0.1% of the total Ae aegypti pupal populations in these neighbourhoods. Other containers ( tyres, vases, 'other discarded' and 'other used') generally produced only low numbers of pupae. In some settings, however, containers in the 'other discarded' category could contribute up to 19% of the total pupal population, and in one survey of one neigbourhood a single container in this category held 9.1% of all the pupae collected. These results, from a city where dengue fever is endemic, will help to focus local campaigns for Ae. aegypti source-reduction on the most productive categories of container.",

Regarding the sanitary impacts of this projects and environmental effects of them, put in evidence that the price of this kind of projects must be in second point of importancse in compare to their benefits for all of humanity. In other hand, the volume of waste water network projects, the large investments needed for conventional methods of construction, and the supply of cheap workers, have lead to non-developed countries, governors selecting trenchless excavation and pipe installation procedures based on hand labors. Obviously this decision can be better justified if it were supported with adjusted design criteria and control procedures. To advance this discussion, we describe the defects observed in projects to date, and define research needs related to this field of study. In the same time, it seems very strange that new method of construction costs, more than traditional method in the poor countries! Regarding all points of views, the problems of cost must be reduced in purpose to render the must developed method in accessibility of poor countries, especially for sanitary projects like water and waste water projects. This other side of problem (cost of unit work) which is not discussed sufficiently in academicals domains and in the industry and busyness activities, needs a new and other kind of regards to it for achieve to economic convenience for realizing the sanitary canalization using most developed techniques (trenchless technology).",
1592,"Plutonium in the WIPP environment: its detection, distribution and behavior The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is the only operating deep underground geologic nuclear repository in the United States. It is located in southeastern New Mexico, approximately 655 m (2150 ft) below the surface of the Earth in a bedded Permian evaporite salt formation. This mined geologic repository is designed for the safe disposal of transuranic (TRU) wastes generated from the US defense program. Aerosol and soil samples have been collected near the WIPP site to investigate the sources of plutonium in the WIPP environment since the late 1990s, well before WIPP received its first shipment. Activities of (238)Pu, (239+240)Pu and (241)Am were determined by alpha spectrometry following a series of chemical separations. The concentrations of Al and U were determined in a separate set of samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The annual airborne concentrations of (239+240)Pu during the period from 1998 to 2010 show no systematic interannual variations. However, monthly (239+240)Pu particulate concentrations show a typical seasonal variation with a maximum in spring, the time when strong and gusty winds frequently give rise to blowing dust. Resuspension of soil particles containing weapons fallout is considered to be the predominant source of plutonium in the WIPP area. Further, this work characterizes the source, temporal variation and its distribution with depth in a soil profile to evaluate the importance of transport mechanisms affecting the fate of these radionuclides in the WIPP environment. The mean (137)Cs/(239+240)Pu, (241)Am/(239+240)Pu activity ratio and (240)Pu/(239)Pu atom ratio observed in the WIPP samples are consistent with the source being largely global fallout. There is no evidence of any release from the WIPP contributing to radionuclide concentrations in the environment.",
1593,"Health risk assessment of toxic metals in surface and groundwater resources of a significant agriculture and industry zone in Turkey Thrace Region has a great agriculture and industry potential and Ergene River Basin is the prime watershed of this significant region. In the current research, water quality of lotic and lentic surface and groundwater resources of Ergene River Basin were evaluated by using some toxic element and health risk assessment indices. Samples were collected from sixty-six (21 of them lotic, 15 of them lentic and 30 of them groundwater) locations and nickel, chromium, arsenic, zinc, lead, copper and cadmium accumulations were read by using an ICP-MS. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) and degree of contamination index (C-deg) were applied to detected data. Also the toxic element concentrations in surface-groundwater were assessed in terms of public health by using some health risk assessment methods including hazard index (HI), hazard quotient (HQ) and cancer risk (CR). According to the results of applied indices, arsenic and chromium were recorded as the most dangerous toxicants among the investigated elements. While the lacustrine ecosystems were recorded as the least contaminated basin components, fluvial ecosystems, especially Corlu Stream and Ergene River, were recorded as the most polluted basin components. It was also recorded that arsenic contents in the drinking water of 50% of the investigated villages were found as a major risk factor for human health in terms of CR.",
1594,"Metallurgical Failure Analysis of a Closed Recirculation System Water Cooling Pipe Catastrophic failure is often associated with a large temperature rise. This situation may lead to a drastic deterioration in material strength where a cooling system is important for a smooth system plant operation to prevent catastrophic failure to its equipments, parts or processes. In this study, a part of a failed closed recirculation system water cooling pipe in a steel manufacturing plant in Malaysia has been investigated for detailed failure analysis. A steam leakage of a water cooling pipe with a closed recirculation system operation made of ASTM A106/A (Carbon Steel Pipes for high temp service) was detected. The aim of this study is to explore the evidence related to the water cooling pipe leakage and to investigate the cause of failure. Detailed investigation was carried out by visual inspection, optical microscopy and hardness testing. With the evidence obtained, due to presence of water scale and prolonged overheating, decarburization had occurred. During decarburization, it was found that carbon elements from inner surface tube had depleted through the outer tube surface. The accumulation of carbon elements on the outer tube surface appears to show significantly higher brittle zone in the outer tube and with the presence of tensile stress developed from operating thermal cycle which subsequently resulted in crack. It can be concluded that the water cooling pipe leakage was due to thermal fatigue.",
1595,"Peat-assisted phytoremediation of waste foundry sands: plant growth, metal accumulation and fertility aspects We investigated the potential of peat additions to improve plant growth and fertility and to reduce plant metal uptake in waste foundry sands (WFS) landfills. The WFS contains 78211 mg kg(-1) and 371 mg kg(-1) concentrations of Cr and Ni, respectively, and varied metal concentrations. The experiment investigated the growth of Brassica juncea plants on fertilized WFS mixed with peat at concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10% (w/w). The highest peat treatment allowed substantial plant growth and increased Ni mass in shoots, which was positively correlated to shoot biomass increments. On a concentration basis, peat additions did not increase shoot Ni values, thus suggesting that plants grown on peat-treated WFS may not increase risks to human and ecological receptors. Chromium was below detection levels in shoots for all peat treatments. Peat-treated substrates also promoted increased CEC values and higher water holding capacity, therefore improving the WFS agronomical properties. These results indicate that peat can be used as an amendment to assist in the phytoremediation of WFS landfill areas. However, there was evidence for increased mobilization of Cr and Ni in the substrate solution which can pose a threat to local groundwater.",
1596,"Synthesis of Petal-Like MnO(2) Nanosheets on Hollow Fe(3)O(4) Nanospheres for Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of Biotreated Papermaking Effluent Owing to the implementation of increasingly stringent water conservation policies and regulations, the pulp and paper mill industry must make increased efforts to meet the limits for pollutant emissions. The primary pretreatment and secondary biochemical treatment methods used currently generally fail to meet the country-specific environmental regulations, and the wastewater must be processed further even after being subjected to secondary biochemical treatments. In this work, we synthesized Fe(3)O(4)/MnO(2) nanocomposites (FMNs) with a flower-like structure for use in the heterogeneous photocatalytic treatment of biotreated papermaking wastewater. FMNs1.25, which were formed using a KMnO(4)/Fe(3)O(4) molar ratio of 1.25, could be separated readily using an external magnetic field and exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than those of the other samples as well as MnO(2) and Fe(3)O(4). The effects of various experimental parameters on the photocatalytic activity of FMNs1.25, including the initial pH of the wastewater and the catalyst dosage, were determined. The common chemical oxygen demand (COD(Cr)) reduction rate in the case of this sample reached 56.58% within 120 min at a pH of 3, the COD(Cr) of effluent after treatment was 52.10 mg/L. Further, even under neutral conditions, the COD(Cr) of the treated effluent was below the current limit for discharge in China. Moreover, the nanocomposites exhibited good recyclability, and their catalytic activity did not decrease significantly even after five usage cycles. This study should serve as a platform for the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for the advanced treatment of biotreated papermaking effluent and refractory organic wastewater.",
1597,"Ecological and Environmental Effects of Estuarine Wetland Loss Using Keyhole and Landsat Data in Liao River Delta, China An estuarine wetland is an area of high ecological productivity and biodiversity, and it is also an anthropic activity hotspot area, which is of concern. The wetlands in estuarine areas have suffered declines, which have had remarkable ecological impacts. The land use changes, especially wetland loss, were studied based on Keyhole and Landsat images in the Liao River delta from 1962 to 2016. The dynamics of the ecosystem service values (ESVs), suitable habitat for birds, and soil heavy metal potential ecological risk were chosen to estimate the ecological effects with the benefit transfer method, synthetic overlaying method, and potential ecological risk index (RI) method, respectively. The driving factors of land use change and ecological effects were analyzed with redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that the built-up area increased from 95.98 km(2) in 1962 to 591.49 km(2) in 2016, and this large change was followed by changes in paddy fields (1351.30 to 1522.39 km(2)) and dry farmland (189.5 to 294.14 km(2)). The area of wetlands declined from 1823.16 km(2) in 1962 to 1153.52 km(2) in 2016, and this change was followed by a decrease in the water area (546.2 to 428.96 km(2)). The land use change was characterized by increasing built-up (516.25%), paddy fields (12.66%) and dry farmland (55.22%) areas and a decline in the wetland (36.73%) and water areas (21.47%) from 1962-2016. Wetlands decreased by 669.64 km(2). The ESV values declined from 6.24 billion US$ to 4.46 billion US$ from 1962 to 2016, which means the ESVs were reduced by 19.26% due to wetlands being cultivated and the urbanization process. The area of suitable habitat for birds decreased by 1449.49 km(2), or 61.42% of the total area available in 1962. Cd was the primary soil heavy metal pollutant based on its concentration, accumulation, and potential ecological risk contribution. The RDA showed that the driving factors of comprehensive ecological effects include wetland area, Cd and Cr concentration, river and oil well distributions. This study provides a comprehensive approach for estuarine wetland cultivation and scientific support for wetland conservation.",
1598,"A comprehensive research on the global all-sky surface solar radiation and its driving factors during 1980-2019 The study evaluated monthly surface solar radiation (SSR) by the second Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) reanalysis and investigated the long-term trend of SSR in regions with excellent performance of reanalysis worldwide. Overall, MERRA-2 performed well in North America (NA), Europe (EUR), Northern East Asia (NEA) and Oceania (OCE). The results suggest that from 1980 to 2019, there has been a widespread downtrend of SSR in NA, NEA and OCE, at-0.316,-0.001 and -1.140 W m(-2) decade(-1), respectively, an uptrend at 0.633 W m(-2) decade(-1) of EUR. NA showed the strongest brightness by 5.886 W m(-2) decade(-1) in 1982-1991. This was associated with the decrease of low cloud fraction (-0.024 decade(-1)), resulting in the weakening (3.164 W m(-2) decade(-1)) of the attenuation effect of cloud on radiation. In EUR, SSR was also affected by cloud changes. The attenuation effect of clouds on SSR was weakened in 1981-1990 and enhanced in 1989-1998, which led to the strongest brightening (4.556 W m(-2) decade(-1)) and dimming (-1.587 W m(-2) decade(-1)), respectively. And in NEA, the reduction of clouds and aerosols dominated the strong brightening by 4.721 W m(-2) decade(-1) during 1992-2001. In addition, NEA experienced the strongest dimming during 1997-2006, which was mainly related to the increase of aerosols. Finally, in OCE, SSR was primarily affected by the water vapor and cloud together, and the strongest brightening (10.130 W m(-2) decade(-1)) and the strongest dimming (-8.892 W m(-2) decade(-1)) occurred in 2010-2019 and 2001-2011, respectively.",
1599,"Removal of anionic dye using amine-functionalized mesoporous hollow shells prepared from corn cob silica This study evaluated the performance of amine-functionalized mesoporous hollow spheres obtained using corn cob (an agriculture byproduct) nanosilica as support material for amine immobilization (NH2-MHS) for removal of Congo Red (CR) dye from aqueous solution. Physical characteristics of adsorbents were studied using zeta potential, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, surface area, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The effects of various physiochemical parameters such as pH (3-9), different adsorbents, temperature (15, 25, and 35 A degrees C), initial dye concentration (10-500 mg/L), and adsorbent dosage (0.1-1.0 g) on the CR removal efficiency were investigated. The equilibrium adsorption data were well fit by the Freundlich model. The maximum adsorption capacity of CR onto NH2-MHS according to the Langmuir isotherm model was 98.72 mg/g at 35 A degrees C and pH 7. The adsorption kinetics were well fit using a pseudo-second-order kinetic model.",
1600,"Microfacies and sequence stratigraphy of the Amapa Formation, Late Paleocene to Early Eocene, Foz do Amazonas Basin, Brazil On the basis of thin-section studies of cuttings and a core from two wells in the Amapa Formation of the Foz do Amazonas Basin, five main microfacies have been recognized within three stratigraphic sequences deposited during the Late Paleocene to Early Eocene. The facies are: 1) Ranikothalia grainstone to packstone facies; 2) ooidal grainstone to packstone facies; 3) larger foraminiferal and red algal grainstone to packstone facies; 4) Amphistegina and Helicostegina packstone facies; and 5) green algal and small benthic foraminiferal grainstone to packstone facies, divisible locally into a green algal and the miliolid foraminiferal subfacies and a green algal and small rotaliine foraminiferal subfacies. The lowermost sequence (Si) was deposited in the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene (biozone LF1, equivalent to P3-P6?) and includes rudaceous grainstones and packstones with large specimens of Ranikothalia bermudezi representative of the mid- and inner ramp. The intermediate and uppermost sequences (S2 and S3) display well-developed lowstand deposits formed at the end of the Late Paleocene (upper biozone LF1) and beginning of the Early Eocene (biozone LF2) on the inner ramp (larger foraminiferal and red algal grainstone to packstone facies), in lagoons (green algal and small benthic foraminiferal facies) and as shoals (ooidal facies) or banks (Amphistegina and Helicostegina facies). Depth and oceanic influence were the main controls on the distribution of these microfacies. Stratal stacking patterns evident within these sequences may well have been related to sea level changes postulated for the Late Paleocene and Early Eocene. During this time, the Amapa Formation was dominated by cyclic sedimentation on a gently sloping ramp. Environmental and ecological stress brought about by sea level change at the end of the biozone LF1 led to the extinction of the larger foraminifera (Ranikothalia bermudezi). (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

1601,"Medical Mucilage Used in Traditional Persian Medicine Practice BACKGROUND: Mucilage compounds are pharmaceutically important polysaccharides that have an extensive range of applications, including binding agents, thickeners, water retention agents, emulsion stabilizers, suspending agents, disintegrates, film formers, and gelling agents. A historical approach to medical science written by Iranian scholars could help in identifying excellent ideas and provide valuable information in this field for proper application. The aim of the current study was to introduce some mucilage uses derived from traditional Persian medicine (TPM). METHODS: In this literature review, we assessed a few main traditional manuscripts of Iranian medicine, including the books Al Havi, Canon of Medicine, Qarabadine-kabir, Zakhireh-ye Khwarazm shahi, Tuhfat ul-Momineen and Makhzan-ul-Adwiah. The word ""loab"" in the aforementioned books were searched and all data about mucilage compounds were collected. RESULTS: The use of medicinal plants containing mucilage in Iran dates back to ancient times. In traditional Persian manuscripts, mucilage is one of the most cited applications of medicinal plants for therapeutic objectives. There are various mucilage-producing plants in TPM such as Malva silvestris, Linum usitissimum, Althaea officinalis, Plantago psyllium, Descureania sophia and Ziziphus vulgaris. They have been used traditionally via oral or topical routes for respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, musculoskeletal, and genital systems as well as skin disorders. Certain applications are unique and promising for today's chronic ailments. CONCLUSION: A scientific assessment of these valuable manuscripts would provide a better insight into the thoughts of the past sages and applicable for clinical use of the mucilage compounds. This may lead to research opportunities in the future.",
1602,"Development, characterization, and utilization of magnetized orange peel waste as a novel adsorbent for the confiscation of crystal violet dye from aqueous solution In this investigation, the adsorption performance of orange peel (OP) and magnetized orange peel (MOP) as adsorbents for the confiscation of crystal violet (CV) dye from synthetically polluted water was examined. The batch experiments were performed by varying the operational parameters like pH, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dose, and temperature. The equilibrium adsorption capacity was higher with MOP (46.94 mg g(-1)) than OP (22.73 mg g(-1)). The better adsorption of CV at higher pH and higher temperatures for both OP and MOP was observed. Adsorption equilibrium data of both OP and MOP were well fitted with Langmuir isotherm, and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of MOP/CV was found to be higher (555.6 mg g(-1) than that of OP/CV (138.9 mg g(-1)). Kinetic data followed the pseudo-second-order (P-S-O) model suggesting that the process of CV adsorption was more inclined toward the chemisorption mechanism. The electrostatic attraction between the depmtonated surface of adsorbate and cationic CV molecule was suggested to be involved in chemisorption. Thermodynamic inspection showed that the process of adsorption of dye onto OP and MOP was spontaneous and endothermic in nature and accompanied by an increase in entropy. Due to very high adsorption affinity, low cost, easy separability, and regenerability, the magnetically modified adsorbent (MOP) has been established to be a very promising remedy for the elimination of CV from industrial wastewater.",
1603,"Compositional data analysis and geochemical modeling of CO(2)-water-rock interactions in three provinces of Korea The CO(2)-rich spring water (CSW) occurring naturally in three provinces, Kangwon (KW), Chungbuk (CB), and Gyeongbuk (GB) of South Korea was classified based on its hydrochemical properties using compositional data analysis. Additionally, the geochemical evolution pathways of various CSW were simulated via equilibrium phase modeling (EPM) incorporated in the PHREEQC code. Most of the CSW in the study areas grouped into the Ca-HCO(3) water type, but some samples from the KW area were classified as Na-HCO(3) water. Interaction with anorthite is likely to be more important than interaction with carbonate minerals for the hydrochemical properties of the CSW in the three areas, indicating that the CSW originated from interactions among magmatic CO(2), deep groundwater, and bedrock-forming minerals. Based on the simulation results of PHREEQC EPM, the formation temperatures of the CSW within each area were estimated as 77.8 and 150Â Â°C for the Ca-HCO(3) and Na-HCO(3) types of CSW, respectively, in the KW area; 138.9Â Â°C for the CB CSW; and 93.0Â Â°C for the GB CSW. Additionally, the mixing ratios between simulated carbonate water and shallow groundwater were adjusted to 1:9-9:1 for the CSW of the GB area and the Ca-HCO(3)-type CSW of the KW area, indicating that these CSWs were more affected by carbonate water than by shallow groundwater. On the other hand, mixing ratios of 1:9-5:5 and 1:9-3:7 were found for the Na-HCO(3)-type CSW of the KW area and for the CSW of the CB area, respectively, suggesting a relatively small contribution of carbonate water to these CSWs. This study proposes a systematic, but relatively simple, methodology to simulate the formation of carbonate water in deep environments and the geochemical evolution of CSW. Moreover, the proposed methodology could be applied to predict the behavior of CO(2) after its geological storage and to estimate the stability and security of geologically stored CO(2).",
1604,"Distribution and loadings of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Xijiang River in Guangdong, South China The Xijiang River is the major tributary of the Pearl River, South China, and is the major source water system for more than 4.5 million of urban population and 28.7 million of rural population. We initiated a systematic study on detection and quantification of organic pollutants in both water and suspended particulate matter (SPM) for samples collected in a span of 12 months. Our results showed that total concentrations of 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) varied from 21.7 to 138 ng l(-1) in water and from 40.9 to 665 microg kg(-1) in SPM. The organic carbon normalized distribution coefficients (K(OC)) computed for the PAHs were correlated well with their octanol-water partition coefficient (K(OW)). The estimated annual loadings of Ant, BaA, and BghiP and the total PAHs in the Xijiang River were 1620, 330, 177 and 19,400 kg, respectively. Further analysis of the data showed that combustion may be the major source of PAHs and that direct leakage of petroleum products may be insignificant.",
1605,Characterization of the Oum Er Rbia (Morocco) high basin karstic water sources by using solid state nuclear track detectors and radon as a natural tracer Uranium and thorium contents as well as radon alpha-activities per unit volume were evaluated inside different water samples by using a method based on calculating the CR-39 and LR-115 type II solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs) detection efficiencies for the emitted alpha-particles and measuring the resulting track density rates. The validity of the SSNTD technique utilized was checked by analysing uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)26H2O) standard solutions. A relationship between water radon concentration and water transmission of different water sources belonging to two regions of the Middle Atlas (Morocco) water reservoir was found. The influence of the water flow rate as well as the permeability and fracture system of the host rocks of the sources studied was investigated.,
1606,"Utilization of reclaimed wastewater for olive irrigation: Effect on soil properties, tree growth, yield and oil content The experiment was conducted over four successive years (2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011) on 'Nabali Muhassan' olive cultivar at a private olive orchard located in the northern part of Jordan (Ramtha area). Experimental treatments applied were irrigation with fresh water (underground well water) and reclaimed wastewater to be compared with the rain-fed (non-irrigated) treatment. Total quantity of fresh water and reclaimed wastewater applied were similar during the irrigation period. Analysis of irrigation water showed higher EC value for reclaimed wastewater as compared to fresh water. Average values of pH, EC, TSS, cations, anions, N, NO3, B, heavy metals, BOD5, COD and fecal coliform in reclaimed wastewater were within the Jordanian standard for water use in irrigation of fruit trees, however, the values of SAR, Cl and Na were higher than the standard limits. Results of soil analysis indicated that soil chemical properties (pH, EC, Ca, Na, SAR, ESP, P, K, Cu, Mn, Pb and B) in soil irrigated with reclaimed wastewater were significantly higher than in soil irrigated with fresh water. The application of reclaimed wastewater or fresh water showed significant increase in annual shoot length as compared to rain-fed treatment. Average olive tree yield was significantly higher for fresh water treatment than the rain-fed treatment, which was not significantly different from the reclaimed wastewater treatment. Fruit oil content based on fresh weight and dry weight basis were significantly higher in rain-fed treatment than freshwater and reclaimed wastewater treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

1607,"Energy-exergy analysis and energy efficiency improvement of coal-fired industrial boilers based on thermal test data Energy conservation and emission reduction in coal-fired boilers are significant to mitigate climate change and alleviate environmental pollution. In this study, the potential for efficiency promotion is assessed by understanding the factors affecting boiler performance. The results are based on thermal tests of 141 coal-fired industrial boilers in Liaoning province, China. Additionally, an exergy analysis model suitable for coal-fired industrial boilers is proposed under the framework of the first and second laws of thermodynamics to improve the operation of boilers. The energy and exergy efficiencies as well as CO2 emissions have been discussed as well. The results indicate that the heat loss of flue gas and unburnt carbon represent the main heat losses. Exergy loss is dominated by destruction due to irreversibility in coal combustion and heat transfer. Average energy efficiency and CO2 emission of 141 boilers were estimated to be 76.08% and 147.13 kg-CO2/GJ, respectively. Exergy efficiencies of typical samples were estimated at about 12.88% for hot water boiler and 27.97% for steam boiler. Raising the efficiencies of 141 boilers to the target level proposed in the standard will lead to a decrease of coal consumption by 155 kt, emission reduction of 341 kt for CO2, 3.72 kt for SO2, and 3.48 kt for NOx per year.",
1608,"Primary health care: what does it mean? The meaning of primary health care (PHC) has evolved over time and, by examining its origins and later formulations, it is possible to arrive at what is meant by PHC today. It originated as primary medical care where patients met health workers. Implicit in this 1st contact concept was that patients had common complaints that could be dealt with easily. This early PHC definition had 2 elements--level of services and the activities themselves. Consequently, it denoted an almost ""grass-roots"" level of health services. At Alma Ata in 1978 the concept was extended. It was maintained that the socioeconomic and political factors affecting poverty and inequality which affected health had to be considered, a philosophy of health. Previously PHC focused mainly on rural areas in developing countries, rather than urban slums in these countries. This had led many to see the PHC system as a second class, rural health system. The PHC approach is clarified by examining its 5 underlying principles--equitable distribution, community involvement, focus on prevention, appropriate technology, and multisectoral approach. Thus, health services should be available to all and community participation will most likely lead to better health. The focus of health care must be on prevention since the greatest strides can be made here. Technology must be appropriate for the locale--it should be cheap, locally available, and cost-effective. Finally, a multisectoral approach recognizes that health is affected by, and affects, housing, education, and public water supplies. eng",
1609,"Phenolic compounds in surface water: methodology and occurrence in Doce River, Brazil Phenolic compounds are widely spread in surface water, mainly in developing countries, where sewage and wastewater treatment are still reduced. Thus, this work quantified these pollutants in the Doce River analyzing the associated risk for the environment and human health. This river is in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil and was recently impacted by the collapse of a mining dam that compromised the resilience of the entire watershed. For that purpose, a methodology for simultaneous identification and quantification of 17 different phenols was developed. It was possible to verify phenolic compounds' occurrence with concentration ranging from 0.13 to 24.16Â ÂµgÂ·L(-1). 2-Nitrophenol and bisphenol A appeared in all samples analyzed. The analytical method was processed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) (C(18) cartridge), gas chromatography with FID, and mass spectrometry to define the analytes' retention time. For case validation, the selectivity, linearity, detection and quantification limits, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, resolution, matrix effect, and peak quality were assessed. Four different solvents were tested in the recovery-grade trials, which were dichloromethane, methanol, acetonitrile, and ethyl acetate. Among them, methanol had a better performance and was used throughout all analyses. The phenolic compounds had a recovery degree higher than 50% after SPE, regardless of the matrices.",
1610,"A test of the utility of exotic tree plantations for understory birds and food resources in the Colombian Andes The spatial distribution and abundance of animals are in part determined by the distribution and abundance of their resource base. In the Central Andes of Colombia, monospecific tree plantations have been used to recover vegetative cover in watershed protection programs, but these plantations differ from natural forests in structure, composition, and resources available to wildlife. To evaluate these plantations as habitat for wildlife, we compared the diversity and abundance of understory birds, flowers, and fruits between juxtaposed 40-yr-old patches of exotic Chinese ash (Fraxinus chinensis) plantations and naturally regenerated forest of the same age. We observed more fruiting species in the regenerated forest, but there were no differences in total flower and fruit availability between habitat types. We also observed differences between habitats in the size of some understory shrubs, but these differences did not lead to differences between habitats in the diversity and abundance of birds. Capture rates of nectarivores correlated with resource abundance at sampling plot scale, but no such correlation was found for frugivores. Understory frugivorous birds are apparently functioning at a larger spatial scale than the patchiness created by the two habitats. Nectarivorous birds are responding to small-scale patchiness in resource availability, but not to the different habitats. These results indicate that at small scales, the ash plantation understory provides adequate habitat for birds.",
1611,"Management of biological and landscape diversity in agricultural landscape The ecologists from Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, UK and USA read during two-days symposium 20 oral presentations and showed 9 posters. The goal of the symposium was to elucidate the relationship between mosaic pattern of agricultural landscapes and control of environment threats like diffuse pollution as well as its effects on biological diversity. The symposium was divided into five session presided by Lech Ryszkowski with the help of the following co-chairmen: Jacques Baudry, Armin Werner, Peter Duelli, Richard Lowrance and Orie Loucks. The presented contribution could be grouped as follows: 1) Role of landscape structure in control of diffuse pollution and diversification of heat balances; 2) Relationships between landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity; 3) Changes in land use of agricultural landscape and their impacts on biodiversity. Contributions as well as discussion during the symposium showed that components of the landscape like shelterbelts, hedges, mid-field ponds or less intensively managed parts of fields or grassland enhance protection of biodiversity. These elements of the landscape have also important bearing on control of diffuse pollution as well as influence water retention in the countryside. The relationships between economic trends in agriculture and prospects for protection of biodiversity was also analysed. Possibilities to use indicators showing overall biological diversity were discussed. The symposium being the 10th meeting of the INTECOL Working Group on Agroecosystems not only provided new insights on agricultural landscape functioning but also proposed new tools for landscape management aiming at integration of agricultural production with the nature protection.",
1612,"Joint inversion of surface and borehole magnetic data to prospect concealed orebodies: A case study from the Mengku iron deposit, northwestern China The Mengku iron deposit is one of the largest magnetite deposits in Xinjiang Province, northwestern China. It is important to accurately delineate the positions and shapes of concealed orebodies for drillhole layout and resource quantity evaluations. Total-field surface and three-component borehole magnetic measurements were carried out in the deposit. We made a joint inversion of the surface and borehole magnetic data to investigate the characteristics of the orebodies. We recovered the distributions of the magnetization intensity using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. Synthetic examples show that the reconstructed models of the joint inversion yield a better consistency with the true models than those recovered using independent inversion. By using joint inversion, more accurate information is obtained on the position and shape of the orebodies in the Mengku iron deposit. The magnetization distribution of Line 135 reveals that the major magnetite orebodies occur at 200-400 m depth with a lenticular cross-section dipping north-east. The orebodies of Line 143 are modified and buried at 100-200 m depth with an elliptical cross-section caused by fault activities at north-northeast directions. This information is verified by well logs. The borehole component anomalies are combined with surface data to reconstruct the physical property model and improve the ability to distinguish vertical and horizontal directions, which provides an effective approach to prospect buried orebodies.

1613,"Modelling nitrite dynamics and associated feedback processes in the Benguela oxygen minimum zone Understanding nitrite dynamics in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) is a challenge as it represents an intermediary nitrogen species with a short turnover time. Nitrite is also reduced to nitrogen in OMZs, preventing its accumulation. This creates difficulties in detecting nitrite with calorimetric methods as concentrations may occur below detection limits in some regions. Nitrite concentrations are key to understanding intermediate nitrogen processes and their implication for nitrogen loss in OMZs. A coupled physical-biogeochemical model is applied in the Benguela OMZ to study nitrite dynamics and its associated feedback processes. Simulated results show occurrence of primary and secondary nitrite maxima in the Benguela shelf waters. The primary nitrite maxima in the Benguela are attributed to nitrification and nitrate assimilation as they occur in association with the nitracline. Secondary nitrite maxima accumulate in the Angola-Benguela Front (ABF) OMZ and are attributed to denitrification. The secondary nitrite maxima are consumed by anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) off Walvis Bay. Nitrite maxima are restricted to the shelf off Walvis Bay and adverted offshore in the ABF region. Interchanges between the poleward South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and the equatorward, well aerated Eastern South Atlantic Central Water (ESACW) drive the seasonality of nitrogen processes in the Benguela. Subsequent nitrite reduction in the Benguela OMZ leads to nitrous oxide production, with high concentrations occurring in the ABF region as a result of nitrification and denitrification. Off Walvis Bay, nitrous oxide production is low since nitrite is consumed by anammox. Nitrous oxide production occurs in thermocline, intermediate and deeper water masses in the ABF region. High N fluxes in the Benguela are attributed to nitrification as compared to anammox and denitrification. Results from this study demonstrate the role of intermediate nitrogen species in nitrogen feedback processes in the Benguela and can be applied in other regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1614,"A review of research on the Lemanea genus in Serbia The first data on the Lemanea genus in Serbia come from the late 20th century. Only one species, L. fluviatilis, was reported from 10 localities in Serbian riverine ecosystems between 1991 and 2017. Extensive research on this genus was performed in April-November 2017-2019, surveying 150 localities in 97 upland and mountain rivers. During this study period, the Lemanea genus was recorded at 14 localities in 12 rivers, while it disappeared from five previously reported localities. A total of four taxa were identified: Lemanea fucina, L. rigida, Lemanea sp. and L. fluviatilis. Lemanea fucina and L. rigida were recorded in Serbia for the first time. L. fluviatilis was the most common taxon. Our research confirmed that Lemanea species prefer similar specific environmental conditions. These species were found in temperate, soft or moderately hard, well-oxygenated and weakly alkaline waters, with low, moderate or high conductivity, and in waters with low content of inorganic nutrients. Due to their sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions, Lemanea species are exposed to negative anthropogenic impact leading to the degradation of their habitats. Intensive construction of small hydropower plants has threatened most habitats of the Rhodophyta species in the last few years.",
1615,"Mineralogy and environmental geochemistry of lagooned ashes resulted from combustion of Maritza East lignite, Bulgaria The phase-mineral composition of the feed coal (FC) from Maritza East lignite used in the Maritza East 1 thermo-electric power station (TEPS) and lagooned ashes (LAs) generated from the burning of this lignite was studied. The concentration and behaviour of 19 trace elements in the FC and LAs, as well as in the soils and plants collected from the restored sites of former LA disposals are also described. The minerals and inorganic phases identified in the lignite include quartz, kaolinite, pyrite, illite, plagioclase, gypsum, calcite, sulphur, marcasite, pyrrhotite, magnetite, K-feldspar, barite, szomolnokite, other Fe sulphates, sylvite, Ni carbonate or oxide/hydroxide., and glass. The phase composition of LAs is represented by original lignite minerals (pyrrhotite, magnetite, quartz, kaolinite) and newly formed minerals and phases generated during the combustion process (pyrrhotite, magnetite, hematite, quartz, metakaolinite, mullite, indialite, glass, char) or storage of LAs (sulphur, hematite, Fe hydroxides, gypsum, barite, Fe sulphates, calcite, sylvite). It was found that Cr, Cu, and Ti in the lignite ashes, and Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni in LAs are relatively enriched in comparison with their respective Clarke values (worldwide average contents) for lignite and subbituminous coal ashes. The concentrations of Ag, Ba, Be, Co, Cu, Ga, Mo, Ni, Rb, Sn, and Ti in the soils have contents higher than their Clarke values for soils. The abundance of these elements plus Mn, V, and Zn in soils is probably related to some occurrence of discrete minerals and phases containing such elements. The contents of Be, Cr, Ga, Li, Ni, Pb, Ti, and V in the plants growing on these restored LA sites have concentrations higher than their Clarke values for land plants (dry basis). The water-soluble modes of occurrence of Ag, Ba, Be, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sri, Ti, and Zn in soils and/or LAs, as well as the plant affinity to these elements should have a leading role for their concentration in plants. The present results reveal that various trace elements with environmental concern could be potential pollutants of surface and subsoil waters, soils and plants in the areas of restored LA sites.

1616,"Environmental and constructive characteristics of drainage galleries of subalveal waters in semi-arid environments of south-eastern Spain and Tunisia Draining galleries are water collection systems that occurs frequently in various geomorphic contexts of semi-arid environments. In this article, we study those that take advantage of subalveal waters by means of different construction techniques, mainly ""cimbras"" and ""cimbra-zanjas"". A comparison has been made between the Tunisian galleries and those of the Spanish SE that have these two characteristics: the exploitation of subsubalveal waters and surface detritic aquifers, and rainfall characteristics of semi-arid climates, specifically annual total rainfall between 300 and 400 mm. The work analyzes the environmental contexts of the selected galleries, especially geology, geomorphology, rainfall torrentiality and hydrology, as well as the constructive, functional characteristics and conservation status of the galleries. The results of the comparative analysis show that there are no significant differences between the galleries of both territories, neither in the necessary environmental conditions, nor in the constructive and functional characteristics adopted.",

1618,"Microbiological and elemental status assessments of traces and toxic elements in locally produced glass bottled soft drinks In Pakistan locally produced soft drinks are widely used especially in summer season. The determination of trace elements particularly the heavy metals in soft drinks have received increasing attention in pollution studies. The monitoring of the concentration levels of essential and toxic elements in these samples helps to assess the degree of environmental pollution or man made contamination. In the present study, fifteen samples of glass bottled soft drinks representing Cola, Lemonade, Diet, Club soda, Ice-cream soda were analyzed for selected Fifteen essential and toxic elements using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer as most sensitive and reliable technique because of its reduce susceptibility to interference. An improved ash digestion method was employed. The determined values were then compared with World Health Organization (WHO) values recommended for drinking water. Most of the elements were observed within the safe limits and the values of Fe, Ni, Pb, Cd and Al were found above the recommendations. In microbiological study except cola drinks many soft drinks contain disease producing microorganisms.",
1619,"Analyzing typhoon-triggered vertical land motion from GPS and environmental load-induced deformation data Typhoon can cause extremely heavy rainfall, low pressure and sea level change, and lead to ground deformations, which can be measured at millimeter-level precision with the Global Positioning System (GPS). Here daily GPS vertical position displacements at 7 stations from Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) were used to analyze regional vertical ground deformations induced by different loading changes of typhoon Mangkhut, along with environmental load-induced deformation data (including atmospheric, non-tidal oceanic and hydrological loading) during 10 - 26 September 2018. The model results showed that vertical ground deformations were caused by atmospheric and non-tidal oceanic loading one day before typhoon's landfall, with the maximum deformation 5. 1 mm and -9. 2 mm, respectively. As typhoon rolled inland, the non-tidal oceanic load-induced deformation decreased quickly, while the atmospheric load-induced deformation was still significant. The model results can well reflect deformations caused by surface water loading in the area along the river, with a correlation of -0. 62 between hydrological load-induced deformations and river water level changes. But systematic bias exists between different models. Due to lack of information on some hydrological variables like groundwater, the long-term hydrological loading effect cannot be simulated well in the model, and the variability of the modeled deformation was much smaller than that of GPS. The maximum subsidence of 25. 7 mm was recorded at GXBH station in 5 days from the beginning of subsidence to the lowest position of -15. 6 mm. Downward motions caused by a second time of water level increases were observed at GDZH and GUAN stations located at the downstream of the Pearl River basin. Additionally, it took one week for the GDZH station to uplift to normal. Relatively good correlations were found between the observed deformations at GDZJ and GXBH stations and river water level changes, with correlations of 0. 66 and 0. 50, respectively. This study shows that transient and long-term effects of hydrological loading induced by typhoon were well captured by GPS, which can provide useful information for monitoring and predicting disasters such as typhoon-induced flood events.",
1620,"Effects of Arsenic, Iron and Fertilizers in Soil on Rice in Cambodia BACKGROUND: In parts of Cambodia, irrigation with groundwater results in arsenic accumulation in soils and rice, leading to health concerns associated with rice consumption. A high concentration of iron in groundwater can precipitate arsenic and reduce its bioavailability, however high concentrations of arsenic and iron can also reduce rice production. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about chemical contamination from inorganic fertilizers used to grow rice. The relationship between soil geochemistry and arsenic concentrations in rice is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this project was to investigate the relationship between arsenic concentrations in irrigation water, soil and rice collected from different sites in Cambodia. A secondary objective was to explore arsenic and phosphorus levels in fertilizer samples obtained from the study area in Cambodia. METHODS: The present study collected 61 well water samples, 105 rice samples, 70 soil samples, 11 inorganic fertilizer samples and conducted interviews with 44 families along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total arsenic, and arsenic species in the water and rice were conducted in Canada by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analyses for metals, total arsenic and phosphorus in soils and inorganic fertilizers were conducted in Cambodia and Singapore by X-ray fluorescence. RESULTS: The concentration of arsenic in rice paddy soils was highly variable and as much as 20 times higher near the irrigation wells than in more distal areas of the paddy. Two farmers in Preak Russey had integrated soil samples with arsenic levels above the concentration associated with toxicity to rice in Taiwan (40 mg/kg) and above the Dutch concentration requiring intervention or remediation (55 mg/kg). The highest total arsenic measured in soil was 95 mg/kg. In Preak Russey, the loading of arsenic from irrigation water was 3710 times greater than the loading of arsenic from inorganic fertilizers. Half of the commercial inorganic fertilizers had less than 50% of the labelled content of phosphorus. CONCLUSIONS: Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of irrigation water, not on inactivation of arsenic in soil. The high levels of iron in groundwater mitigate arsenic toxicity, but the accumulation of iron could later result in lower rice productivity. Irrigation of rice with groundwater is not likely sustainable. To improve rice productivity, the content of phosphorus in local inorganic fertilizers must be improved to world standards. X-ray fluorescence analysis can quickly identify poor quality fertilizers. INFORMED CONSENT: Obtained. COMPETING INTERESTS: The authors declare no competing financial interests.",
1621,"'Leaving no one behind': reflections on the design of community-based HIV prevention for migrants in Johannesburg's inner-city hostels and informal settlements Background: Unmanaged urban growth in southern and eastern Africa has led to a growth of informal housing in cities, which are home to poor, marginalised populations, and associated with the highest HIV prevalence in urban areas. This article describes and reflects on the authors' experiences in designing and implementing an HIV intervention originally intended for migrant men living in single-sex hostels of inner-city Johannesburg. It shows how formative research findings were incorporated into project design, substantially shifting the scope of the original project. Methods: Formative research activities were undertaken to better understand the demand-and supply-side barriers to delivering HIV prevention activities within this community. These included community mapping, a baseline survey (n = 1458) and client-simulation exercise in local public sector clinics. The intervention was designed and implemented in the study setting over a period of 18 months. Implementation was assessed by way of a process evaluation of selected project components. Results: The project scope expanded to include women living in adjacent informal settlements. Concurrent sexual partnerships between these women and male hostel residents were common, and HIV prevalence was higher among women (56%) than men (24%). Overwhelmingly, hostel residents were internal migrants from another province, and most felt 'alienated' from the rest of the city. While men prioritised the need for jobs, women were more concerned about water, sanitation, housing and poverty alleviation. Most women (70%) regarded their community as unsafe (cf. 47% of men). In the final intervention, project objectives were modified and HIV prevention activities were embedded within a broader health and development focus. 'Community health clubs' were established to build residents' capacity to promote health and longer term well-being, and to initiate and sustain change within their communities. Conclusions: To improve efforts to address HIV in urban informal settings, intervention designers must acknowledge and engage with the priorities set by the marginalised communities that live here, which may well encompass more pressing issues associated with daily survival.",
1622,"Arsenic exposure from drinking water and endothelial dysfunction in Bangladeshi adolescents Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with âˆ¼80% of CVD-related deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Growing evidence suggests that chronic arsenic exposure may contribute to CVD through its effect on endothelial function in adults. However, few studies have examined the influence of arsenic exposure on cardiovascular health in children and adolescents. To examine arsenic's relation to preclinical markers of endothelial dysfunction, we enrolled 200 adolescent children (ages 15â€“19 years; median 17) of adult participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS), in Araihazar, Bangladesh. Participants' arsenic exposure was determined by recall of lifetime well usage for drinking water. As part of HEALS, wells were color-coded to indicate arsenic level (<10 Î¼g/L, 10â€“50 Î¼g/L, >50 Î¼g/L). Endothelial function was measured by recording fingertip arterial pulsatile volume change and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) score, an independent CVD risk factor, was calculated from these measurements. In linear regression models adjusted for participant's sex, age, education, maternal education, land ownership and body weight, individuals who reported always drinking water from wells with >50 Î¼g/L arsenic had a 11.75% lower level of RHI (95% CI: âˆ’21.26, âˆ’1.09, p = 0.03), as compared to participants who drank exclusively from wells with â‰¤50 Î¼g/L arsenic. Sex-stratified analyses suggest that these associations were stronger in female participants. As compared to individuals who drank exclusively from wells with â‰¤50 Î¼g/L arsenic, the use of wells with >50 Î¼g/L arsenic was associated with 14.36% lower RHI (95% CI: âˆ’25.69, âˆ’1.29, p = 0.03) in females, as compared to 5.35% lower RHI (95% CI: âˆ’22.28, 15.37, p = 0.58) in males for the same comparison. Our results suggest that chronic arsenic exposure may be related to endothelial dysfunction in adolescents, especially among females. Further work is needed to confirm these findings and examine whether these changes may increase risk of later adverse cardiovascular health events. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",
1623,"The environmental and public health risks associated with arsenical use in animal feeds Arsenic exposures contribute significantly to the burden of preventable disease worldwide, specifically related to increased risks of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Most exposures are associated with natural contamination of groundwater, which is difficult to mitigate when these sources are used for drinking water. An anthropogenic source of arsenic exposure stems from the widespread use of arsenical drugs in food-animal production in the United States and China, among many countries. This use results in residual contamination of food products from animals raised with the drugs, as well as environmental contamination associated with disposal of wastes from these animals. Land disposal of these wastes can contaminate surface and ground water, and the conversion of animal wastes into fertilizer pellets for home use as well as the introduction of animal waste incinerators may increase opportunities for exposure. As an intentional additive to animal feed, use of arsenical drugs is a preventable source of human exposure. The domestic practice of using these drugs in poultry production has been the subject of media attention and limited research, though the use of these drugs in domestic swine production and in the rapidly growing foreign animal production industry remains largely uncharacterized. This continued expansion of arsenical drug use may likely increase the burden of global human arsenic exposure and risk.",
1624,"Community perspectives on the introduction of biodiesel production in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa This paper presents the outcomes of a questionnaire survey to ascertain the perspectives of local communities on the proposal to construct a large-scale biodiesel production facility in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, with feedstock supply to the production facility from the former communal homelands of the Province. A total of 303 questionnaires were administered through interactions with the communities that are expected to be a part of the feedstock production supply chain by visiting households and having in-depth interviews, and through a focus group discussion. Opinions were found to be overwhelmingly against the proposed biodiesel production supply chain. The concerns of local people varied, but the major issues were land availability as this is regarded as their identity; infrastructure development; associated pollution (air and water) posing serious health risk; doubts about the credibility of the developers; food security; and the distortion of the social fabric of the local communities. In general, local people felt that they were excluded from the project development and were asked to accept industrial scale development that will further lead to the impoverishment of the communities. The results also highlighted how large-scale plants may be affected by the local dynamics of perceptions; the willingness to partake in the supply chain was informed by personal, social and institutional factors and beliefs, as well as internal conflicts, due to perceived environmental, social and ecological risks, that were aggravated by miscommunication and the lack of understanding. The paper is deemed useful for policy makers to understand why communities may object to relatively large bioenergy projects, and to assist the developers of such projects to avoid delays and refusal of planning consent that can be associated with adverse local opinions.

1625,"Conventional and unconventional petroleum ""orderly accumulation"": Concept and practical significance Based on the latest global conventional-unconventional petroleum development situation and the conclusion of petroleum geology theory and technology innovation in recent 10 years, the connotation of conventional and unconventional petroleum ""orderly accumulation"" connotation is formulated. This concept indicates that, unconventional petroleum occurs in the hydrocarbon supply direction of conventional petroleum, and conventional petroleum may appear in the outer space of unconventional petroleum. Proper evaluation methods and engineering technology are important to push the conventional-unconventional petroleum co-development, and the petroleum finding thought from outer-source into inner-source. Unconventional petroleum evaluation focuses on source rocks characteristics, lithology, physical property, brittleness, oil-gas possibility and stress anisotropy. Taking shale gas for examples, in China, these six properties are TOC>2%, laminated silicious calcareous shale or calcareous silicious shale, porosity 3%-8%, brittle minerals content 50%-80%, gas content 2.3-4.1 m(3)/t, pressure coefficient 1.0-2.3, natural fractures; in north America, these six properties are TOC>4%, silicious shale or calcareous shale or marl, porosity 4%-9%, brittle minerals content 40%-70%, gas content 2.8-9.9 m(3)/t, pressure coefficient 1.3-1.85, natural fractures. ""Sweet spot area"" assessment, ""factory-like"" operation pattern and other core evaluation methods and technologies are discussed. And 8 key elements of unconventional ""sweet spot area"" are proposed, 3 of them are TOC>2% (for shale oil S1>2 mg/g), higher porosity (for tight oil & gas >10%, shale oil & gas >3%), and microfractures. Multiple wells ""factory-like"" operation pattern is elaborated, and its implementation needs 4 elements, i.e. batch well spacing, standard design, flow process, and reutilization. Through horizontal well volume fractures in directions, ""man-made reservoirs"" with large-scale fracture systems can be formed underground. For ""shale oil revolution"" in future, non-water ""gas in critical state"" and etc. fracturing fluid and matching technology should be stressed to be industrially tested and encouraged to be low cost developed.",
1626,"Episodic ground deformation associated with geothermal energy production at the Guayabo Caldera, Costa Rica The ground response to the production of energy in geothermal fields can be observed in the form of ground displacement and seismic activity. Changes in the temperature, volume, pressure of the reservoir can culminate in surface deformation and in seismicity at the reservoir edges and/or near the production wells. Identifying the origin of the ground response enables controlled management of the reservoir and can help prevent damage to structures. Satellite remote sensing (InSAR) permits the study of the deformation at these sites with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, Central America has a dynamic atmosphere with considerable water vapour and constant growth of vegetation all year long, which leads to decorrelation between SAR images. Here we study the Dr. Alfredo Mainieri Protti geothermal field, located near Miravalles Volcano in the Northern Costa Rica volcanic arc. We measure the deformation associated with geothermal energy production using data from two satellites (ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1) between January 2015 and January 2017. The ALOS-2 data was used to obtain the extent of the affected area, and two StaMPS multi-temporal methods (Persistent Scatter (PS) InSAR, and Small Baselines(SB)) were applied to the Sentinel-1 data, to obtain the temporal pattern of the ground displacements. Results show a direct response of the ground to the extraction of fluids. The pattern of deformation obtained with ALOS-2 is spatially correlated with the geothermal field, and with the recorded seismicity. Between April 2015 to October 2016, periods of uplift and subsidence were observed with values between-2.0 to 3.0 cm every 120 days, linked to changes in the amount of fluids extracted from the reservoir. The results also show the ability of the reservoir to recover rapidly following a decrease in extraction rate. This work has shown that even in this tropical region it is possible to monitor anthropogenic ground motion using InSAR. This is beneficial for the Central American region, as satellite images are becoming more frequently acquired and available, and can be used to boost the monitoring of seismic regions, volcanic activity and anthropogenic activities.

1627,"Off-flavor compounds from decaying cyanobacterial blooms of Lake Taihu The effect of cyanobacterial bloom decay on water quality and the complete degradation of cyanobacterial blooms in a short period were examined by an enclosure experiment in Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu, China. Water quality parameters as well as taste and odor compounds during the breakdown of cyanobacterial blooms were measured. Results showed that the decay of cyanobacterial blooms caused anoxic water conditions, decreased pH, and increased nutrient loading to the lake water. The highest concentrations of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), and beta-cyclocitral were observed in the anoxic water, at 62331.8, 12413.3, and 1374.9 ng/L, respectively. 2-Methylisoborneol was dominant during the live growth phase of cyanobacterial blooms, whereas DMS and DMTS were dominant during the decomposition phase. Dissolved oxygen, pH, and chlorophyll a were negatively correlated with DMS, DMTS, and beta-cyclocitral, whereas total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and ammonium (NH(4+)-N) were positively correlated with DMS, DMTS, beta3-cyclocitral, and beta-ionone. The experimental results suggested that preventing the anaerobic decomposition of cyanobacterial blooms is an important strategy against the recurrence of a malodor crisis in Lake Taihu.",
1628,"LOCAL KNOWLEDGE-BASED WATER MANAGEMENT AND IRRIGATION IN THE WESTERN PAMIRS For many people living in Central Asia, the economic decline and societal disintegration of the postSoviet space meant a dramatic socio-economic marginalization and pauperization. Against this background and accompanied by the liquidation of numerous state enterprises, many citizens lost their jobs and secure wages. Simultaneously, the state radically cut the provision of social services. The increased uncertainty led to a rising dependency on access to, as well as utilization and the decentralized management of, locally available resources and assets for one's own survival, especially in the countryside. -Because of the immediate relationship between these challenges and the comparatively scarce availability of affordable food products, the collaborative management of scarce water sources and common operation of labour-intensive irrigation infrastructure for local agricultural food production are especially significant in arid high mountain regions such as the remote Western Pamirs in Tajikistan. By means of a micro-level study conducted in the Wakhan Valley, it will be shown how self-organized management practices and pragmatic technical solutions fed by local knowledge contribute to addressing the uneven and irregular spatiotemporal water supply for irrigation. The findings reveal that local-specific water management and irrigation arrangements prove to be not only an essential basis for local food production but also a central instrument for balancing interests within a community and a means of social organization. The study provides an example of where human and social assets such as local environmental, cultural and social knowledge; common decision-making; and coordinated action become key factors for equitable utilization of locally available natural resources on the one hand. On the other hand, the study shows how local knowledge-informed collaborative resource management contributes to community cohesion and individual survival in a society which is struggling with manifold societal challenges.",
1629,"An integrated approach for prioritization of river water quality sampling points using modified Sanders, analytic network process, and hydrodynamic modeling Determination of the water quality monitoring network (WQMN) is a vital stage for surveying ecosystem health. Studies have been done in determining the optimal number and location of sampling points, but seasonality of water quality, especially for heavy metals, has been rarely studied. For the first time, this study proposes a framework to determine the optimal location of sampling points to monitor lead (Pb). This study was conducted for the Karoun River, located in southwestern Iran. First, hydraulic characteristics of the river were simulated by implementing of MIKE11 software as well as water quality(variation of Pb concentration). Nashâ€‘Sutcliffe coefficient were 0.91 and 0.91 for discharge calibration and validation, respectively. Second, 16 potential sampling points were proposed using modified Sanders' approach considering seasonality. For a better accuracy in the WQMN layout and a more efficient site selection of sampling points, a 1-km buffer is stretched along the river for determining non-point source pollution sources and prioritizing candidate points. This leads to considering different land uses in the study area, while GIS software has been employed. Seasonal changes and land use have a significant impact on the location of optimal sampling points. The presented framework can be used to improve water quality and support watershed protection efforts.",

However, the elements needed to comprehensively operationalize multilevel governance remain undefined in the literature. This article describes the five necessary ingredients to a multilevel framework: sanctioning and coordinating authority, provision of capacity, knowledge co-production, framing of co-benefits, and engagement of civil society. The framework's analytical utility is illustrated through two contrasting case examples-watershed management in the United States and air quality management in China. The framework balances local and central actors, which can promote a more effective governance regime.",
1631,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Mothers/Caregivers on Household Water Treatment Methods in Northwest Ethiopia: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study In Ethiopia, ensuring safe drinking water remains a big challenge where waterborne diseases, including diarrhea cause a great harm in many rural communities. Limited knowledge, misinformation, negative attitude, and lack of experience toward best practices of alternative water treatment technologies were among the leading challenges. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 23 to 30, 2015, in Dabat District. The study participants were selected by using simple random sampling method. Questionnaire-based face-to-face interview technique of data collection was used by 20 data collectors under close supervision with six supervisors. From the total of 845 participants with mother-child paired 49.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] (45.8, 52.5%) had good knowledge, and 54.8%, 95% CI (51.6, 58.3%) had favorable-attitude toward household water treatment. Only 23.1%, 95% CI (20, 26%) of the study participants had practiced household water treatment. Being an urban resident (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.58, 95% CI: [1.62, 4.11]), having good-knowledge (AOR: 2.62, 95% CI: [1.81, 3.79]), favorable attitude (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: [1.01, 2.08]), and used unimproved water source (AOR: 1.67,95% CI: [1.11, 2.50]) were factors associated with household water treatment practices in the district. Despite mothers/caregivers having a fairly good knowledge and positive attitude, their practice of treating drinking water at household level was quite low. Thus, well designed strategy for health education on effective water treatment methods through the national health extension program is recommended.",

1633,"Variation of palaeostress patterns along the Oriente transform wrench corridor, Cuba: significance for Neogene-Quaternary tectonics of the Caribbean realm In this study, we address the late Miocene to Recent tectonic evolution of the North Caribbean (Oriente) Transform Wrench Corridor in the southern Sierra Maestra mountain range, SE Cuba. The region has been affected by historical earthquakes and shows many features of brittle deformation in late Miocene to Pleistocene reef and other shallow water deposits as well as in pre-Neogene, late Cretaceous to Eocene basement rocks. These late Miocene to Quaternary rocks are faulted, fractured, and contain calcite- and karst-filled extension gashes. Type and orientation of the principal normal palaeostress vary along strike in accordance with observations of large-scale submarine structures at the south-eastern Cuban margin. Initial N-S extension is correlated with a transtensional regime associated with the fault, later reactivated by sinistral and/or dextral shear, mainly along E-W-oriented strike-slip faults. Sinistral shear predominated and recorded similar kinematics as historical earthquakes in the Santiago region. We correlate palaeostress changes with the kinematic evolution along the boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates. Three different tectonic regimes were distinguished for the Oriente transform wrench corridor (OTWC): compression from late Eocene-Oligocene, transtension from late Oligocene to Miocene (?) (D-1), and transpression from Pliocene to Present (D-2-D-4), when this fault became a transform system. Furthermore, present-day structures vary along strike of the Oriente transform wrench corridor (OTWC) on the south-eastern Cuban coast, with dominantly transpressional/compressional and strike-slip structures in the east and transtension in the west. The focal mechanisms of historical earthquakes are in agreement with the dominant ENE-WSW transpressional structures found on land. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1634,"CONSIDERATIONS ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES ON MOLDOVA RIVER LOWER COURSE AND THE EVOLUTION OF REGULARIZATION WORKS The paper presents an analysis of the morphological changes created on the Moldova River lower course. The studies and researches were carried out on the sector around Pildesti locality, where Roman water catchment is located. The successive floods from 1994 to 2018 have morphologically modified the Moldova River minor river bed, which determined supply parameters of the wells located on the left bank of the river. The minor river bed moves horizontally during floods due to the degradation of the jetties and the enclosure beams. The floods of 2016 and 2018 partially and totally destroyed some of the riverbed's shore protections. Also, part of the shore protection works have been degraded, which has influenced the stability of the Moldova River left bank. The floods in the past ten years have led to the displacement of the minor river bed towards the right river bank by breaking the old enclosure dikes and the jetties. Studies conducted during 2012-2018 analysed hydrological, hydraulic, morphological and topographic parameters on the considered river sector. The research analysed the concurrence of regulation and protection works in the water catchment area during floods. The flood of 2016 forced the restoration of the Moldova River minor river bed, to ensure the optimum wells operation.",
1635,"Environmental Exposures and Cardiovascular Disease A Challenge for Health and Development in Low- and Middle -Income Countries Environmental exposures in low- and middle-income countries lie at the intersection of increased economic development and the rising public health burden of cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence suggests an association of exposure to ambient air pollution, household air pollution from biomass fuel, lead, arsenic, and cadmium with multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Although populations in low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately exposed to environmental pollution, evidence linking these exposures to cardiovascular disease is derived from populations in high-income countries. More research is needed to further characterize the extent of environmental exposures.",

Overall, 30 (1.6%) individuals had active trachoma; the prevalence in children aged 1-9 years was 3.4% (25/742) with no statistically significant difference in prevalence between the regions. There was a significant difference in overall seroprevalence by region: 26.2% in LRR and 17.1% in URR (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). In children 1-9 years old, seroprevalence was 4.4% in LRR and 3.9% in URR. Reversible catalytic models using information on age-specific seroprevalence demonstrated a decrease in the transmission of Ct infection in both regions, possibly reflecting the impact of improved access to water, health and sanitation as well as mass drug administration campaigns. Serological testing for antibodies to Ct antigens is potentially useful for trachoma programmes, but consideration should be given to the co-endemicity of sexually transmitted Ct infections.",
1637,"Seasonal Water Level Fluctuation and Concomitant Change of Nutrients Shift Microeukaryotic Communities in a Shallow Lake Seasonal water level fluctuations (WLFs) impose dramatic influences on lake ecosystems. The influences of WLFs have been well studied for many lake biotas but the microeukaryotic community remains one of the least-explored features. This study employed high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of microeukaryotic communities in the dry and wet seasons with concomitant change of nutrients in Poyang Lake, which experiences huge seasonal WLFs. The results showed that the dry season and wet season had distinct microeukaryotic community compositions and structures. In the dry season, Ciliophora (13.86-40.98%) and Cryptomonas (3.69-18.64%) were the dominant taxa, and the relative abundance of these taxa were significant higher in the dry season than wet season. Ochrophyta (6.88-45.67%) and Chlorophyta (6.31-22.10%) was the dominant taxa of microeukaryotic communities in the wet season. The seasonal variation of microeukaryotic communities was strongly correlated to seasonal nutrient variations. Microeukaryotic communities responded significantly to dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and soluble reactive phosphorus in the dry season, and correlated to nitrate and total phosphorus in the wet season. The microeukaryotic community showed different modular structures in two seasons, and nutrient variations were the key factors influencing seasonal variations of the modular structures. Moreover, microeukaryotic community networks based on different seasons indicated that the microeukaryotic community co-occurrence patterns were not constant but varied largely associating with the nitrogen and phosphorus variations under the effects of WLFs. Our results are important for understanding how microeukaryotic communities respond to nutrient variation under seasonal water level fluctuation.",
1638,"Groundwater contamination in parts of Nalgonda district, Telangana, India as revealed by trace elemental studies The present paper deals with major and trace elements geochemistry of the groundwater from Nalgonda district, Telangana. The study area is very important in terms of anthropogenic activity like rapid industrial, urban development, pesticides, pharmaceutical, granite polishing and agro based industries. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) was employed to determine the concentration of trace elements in collected groundwater samples (bore well). These probe elements were further categorized as toxic elements (Pb, As, Cd, and V), alkaline earths (Sr and Ba), alkali metals (Li, Rb), transition metals (Cr, Mo and Ni), metallic elements (Cu, Fe, Zn, Al, Co), and other non-metallic elements (Se and Si). The groundwater quality was examined in perspective of Indian as well as World Health Organization drinking water standards. Based on the analytical results, groundwater in the study area is found to be slightly alkaline in nature and very hard, the average abundance of the major cations and anions is in the order of Ca+< Na+< Mg+< K+ and Cl-< HCO3 (-)< CO3 (-)< SO4 (-)< NO3 (-)< F- respectively. The dominant hydro chemical facies of groundwater is Na+ - HCO (3) (-) - Cl- and Na+ - Cl- - HCO- (3) types. The results of trace elements shows that concentration of Pb, As, Cd, V in collected samples exceeding the desirable limits, and in the case of alkaline, alkali, transition, non-metallic elements, seventy per cent of the samples crossed the desirable limits, but all metallic elements viz. Cu, Fe, Zn, Al, Co is within the limits as per Indian as well as World Health Organizations drinking water standards. Factor analysis results shows that seven factors emerged as a significant contributor to the groundwater contamination is about 65.32 per cent. The spatial variation maps decipher trace elemental concentrations both geogenic and anthropogenic origin, by three zones i.e. 'low', 'moderate' and 'high' of the study area based on environment using Arc-GIS. High concentrations of trace elements are indicative of phenomenal rise in chemical composition and likely to have its origin from silicate weathering reactions and dissolution/precipitation processes supported by rainfall and anthropogenic activities, indiscriminate use of fertilizers/pesticides, and disposal of waste and sewage, release of reactive pollutants into the atmosphere by industries. Hence, this work is of immense societal benefit in terms of prevailing human health hazards in the study area with a direct relevance to such industrially populated regions elsewhere.",
1639,"Cultivating Innovation and Equity in Co-Production of Commercialized Spring Water in Peri-Urban Bandung, Indonesia This paper examines a co-production arrangement between private actors, households, and community actors occurring within the framework of scheme of commercialised spring water in peri-urban Bandung, Indonesia. We argue that the provision of spring water in Ujungberung District is a form of coproduction, characterised by: (1) any one, or the elements, of the service production process being shared; (2) the presence of a fundamental shift in the balance of power between the primary producers and users/communities, and (3) the existence of mutual support and relationship networks, rather than a clearly defined delineation between providers and clients. Actor contributions defined as inputs along the value chain of spring water production were examined. We describe interactions between local private actors and community members in planning, service delivery, and conflict management with respect to disruption of water supplies, free-riding behaviour, and the geographical distribution of services. This paper identifies several institutional innovations that may yield a safer and more affordable water supply and nurture equity in the sense of: (1) improved access to water for the previously unserved people by piped water and boreholes; (2) the opportunity to negotiate from below; and (3) transparency and accountability.",
1640,"Evaluation of groundwater quality and health risks from contamination in the north edge of the Loess Plateau, Yulin City, Northwest China Groundwater is a vital source for domestic and irrigation purposes in the loess area of Northwest China where climate is arid. However, the quality of groundwater in this area is deteriorating due to intensive industrial and agricultural activities, and this has a great adverse impact on human health. In order to better understand the pollution status of groundwater and the health risks to local residents, comprehensive water quality index was applied to assess the quality of drinking water in Yulin City, Northwest China, and sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate and permeability index were used to evaluate the quality of irrigation water. Moreover, the health risks caused by ingestion of groundwater were evaluated using the model proposed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. The results show that all groundwater samples for irrigation will not induce soil salinization, but more than half of them are not suitable for drinking, and Fe, Mn, TH, Mg2+ and NO3-N are the common contaminants which are mainly from natural processes, industrial and agricultural activities. The health risk assessment indicates that children face greater non-carcinogenic risk than adults. The order of contribution of contaminants to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3- > As > F- > Fe > Mn > Ba2+ > Cr6+ > Zn > NO2-. The average carcinogenic risk of carcinogens (Cr6+ and As) is 1.17 x 10(-4) and 1.37 x 10(-4) for adults and children, respectively, which surpasses the permissible level (1 x 10(-6)) stipulated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. Hence, effective measures are highly demanded to manage groundwater pollution and reduce the risks to human health.",
1641,"Study and Interpretation of Chemical Composition of Rainwater in Selected Urban and Rural Locations in India Using Multivariate Analysis Rainwater is an important untapped resource for all water managers and can be collected and used personally for all uses and simultaneously diverted to ground for recharge of depleting aquifers. Rain water is the most purest form of water until it is contaminated by the atmospheric pollution. Evaluation of rainwater quality analysis is also essential for non- potable applications and to match quality to specific uses. Rainwater quality analysis is, therefore, carried out to understand the problems of rainwater contamination with various pollutants. Rainwater samples were collected from the pre-monsoon season of March 2010 to post- monsoon of October 2013, from seven sampling sites namely Irongmara, Badarpur, Bongaigaon, Dolaigaon, BGR Township, Kolkata and Kharagpur, which characterised typical suburban, urban and industrialised locations respectively. A total of 943 samples were collected during this period from the sampling sites, taking utmost care in sampling and storage were analysed for heavy metals determination. Results for pH, EC, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cr and Co were reported in this study. The samples were collected using PVC bottles. The highest concentration of elements was observed at the beginning of the rainfall season when large amounts of dust accumulated in the atmosphere scavenged by rain. The values of pH in rainwater samples were relatively within the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for drinking water. Multivariate statistical analysis especially varimax rotation was applied to bring to focus the hidden yet important variables which influence the rainwater quality. It is also observed that rainwater contamination may not be restricted to industrial areas alone but vehicular emission may also contribute significantly in certain areas.",
1642,"Chronic arsenic poisoning from burning high-arsenic-containing coal in Guizhou, China Arsenic is an environmental hazard and the reduction of drinking water arsenic levels is under consideration. People are exposed to arsenic not only through drinking water but also through arsenic-contaminated air and food. Here we report the health effects of arsenic exposure from burning high arsenic-containing coal in Guizhou, China. Coal in this region has undergone mineralization and thus produces high concentrations of arsenic. Coal is burned inside the home in open pits for daily cooking and crop drying, producing a high concentration of arsenic in indoor air. Arsenic in the air coats and permeates food being dried producing high concentrations in food; however, arsenic concentrations in the drinking water are in the normal range. The estimated sources of total arsenic exposure in this area are from arsenic-contaminated food (50-80%), air (10-20%), water (1-5%), and direct contact in coal-mining workers (1%). At least 3,000 patients with arsenic poisoning were found in the Southwest Prefecture of Guizhou, and approximately 200,000 people are at risk for such overexposures. Skin lesions are common, including keratosis of the hands and feet, pigmentation on the trunk, skin ulceration, and skin cancers. Toxicities to internal organs, including lung dysfunction, neuropathy, and nephrotoxicity, are clinically evident. The prevalence of hepatomegaly was 20%, and cirrhosis, ascites, and liver cancer are the most serious outcomes of arsenic poisoning. The Chinese government and international organizations are attempting to improve the house conditions and the coal source, and thereby protect human health in this area.",
1643,"NOBLE GASES FINGERPRINT THE SOURCE AND EVOLUTION OF ORE-FORMING FLUIDS OF CARLIN-TYPE GOLD DEPOSITS IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE, SOUTH CHINA Precise constraints on the source and evolution of ore-forming fluids of Carlin-type gold deposits in the Golden Triangle (south China) are of critical importance for a better understanding of the ore genesis and a refined genetic model for gold mineralization. However, constraints on the source of ore fluid components have long been a challenge due to the very fine grained nature of the ore and gangue minerals in the deposits. Here we present He, Ne, and Ar isotope data of fluid inclusion extracts from a variety of ore and gangue minerals (arsenian pyrite, realgar, quartz, calcite, and fluorite) representing the main and late ore stages of three well-characterized major gold deposits (Shuiyindong, Nibao, and Yata) to provide significant new insights into the source and evolution of ore-forming fluids of this important gold province. Measured He isotopes have R/R-A ratios ranging from 0.01 to 0.4 that suggest a maximum of 5% mantle helium with an R/R-A of 8. The Ne and Ar isotope compositions are broadly comparable to air-saturated water, with a few analyses indicating the presence of an external fluid containing nucleogenic Ar-38 and radiogenic Ar-40. Plotted on the Ne-20/He-4 vs. helium R/R-A and He-3/Ne-20 vs. He-4/Ne-20 diagrams, the results define two distinct arrays that emanate from a common sedimentary pore fluid or deeply sourced metamorphic fluid end-member containing crustal He. The main ore-stage fluids are interpreted as a mixture of magmatic fluid containing mantle He and sedimentary pore fluid or deeply sourced metamorphic fluid with predominantly crustal He, whereas the late ore-stage fluids are a mixture of sedimentary pore fluid or deeply sourced metamorphic fluid bearing crustal He and shallow meteoric groundwater containing atmospheric He. Results presented here, when combined with independent evidence, support a magmatic origin for the ore-forming fluids. The ascending magmatic fluid mixed with sedimentary pore fluid or deeply sourced metamorphic fluid in the ore stage and subsequently mixed with the meteoric groundwater in the late ore stage, eventually producing the Carlin-type gold deposits in the Golden Triangle.",
1644,"A case study on co-exposure to a mixture of organic solvents in a Tunisian adhesive-producing company OBJECTIVES: to assess environmental and biological monitoring of exposure to organic solvents in a glue-manufacturing company in Sfax, Tunisia. METHODS: Exposure of volunteer workers, in the solvented glue-work-stations, in the control laboratory and in the storage rooms of the finished products, was assessed through indoor-air and urine measurements. Informed consent of the workers was obtained. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The exposure indexes were found with high values in the solvented workshop as well as in the control laboratory and were respectively, 8.40 and 3.12. These indexes were also correlated with hexane and toluene indoor air concentrations. As to urine, the obtained results for the 2,5-hexandione and hippuric acid, metabolites of hexane and toluene, respectively, were in accord with the indoor-air measurements, with an average of 0.46 mg/l and 1240 mg/g of creatinine. CONCLUSION: This study assessed for the first time biological exposure to organic solvents used in Tunisian adhesive industries. Although values are likely to underestimate true exposure levels, some figures exceed European and American occupational exposure guidelines.",
1645,"The effects of diagenesis on the petrophysical and geochemical attributes of the Asmari Formation, Marun oil field, southwest Iran The distribution of good reservoir quality and its causes is the main challenges in carbonate reservoir characterization. This study investigates the effects of diagenetic processes on the reservoir quality of the carbonate successions of the Asmari Formation, in the Marun oil field, southwest Iran. The study applies an integrated approach including core petrography, petrophysical rock typing, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes as well as major and trace elements analyses. Petrographic studies and geochemical analyses express that the Asmari limestones have been affected mainly by compaction, dissolution, recrystallization, calcite and anhydrite cementation and dolomitization. Among those diagenetic overprints, dolomitization and dissolution played an important role to enhance the reservoir quality of the formation. Moreover, four types of dolomites were recognized and the rate of dolomitization increases toward the top of the Asmari carbonate successions. Possible models for dolomitization include mixing zone, brine reflux, seepage reflux and tidal pumping of seawater. Employing Flow Zone Index and Discrete Rock Type concepts led to classification of the Asmari reservoir into seven reservoir rock types. Integrating reservoir rock typing with petrographic studies and geochemical analyses also confirms that reservoir quality of the Asmari Fm. would have been mainly controlled by diagenetic processes. Moreover, stable isotopes, trace elements and facies analyses support the idea that carbonate intervals of the Asmari Formation were deposited in a warm, shallow-water environment under a saline condition.",
1646,"Hidden but Ubiquitous: The Pre-Rift Continental Mantle in the Red Sea Region Volcanism in the western part of the Arabian plate resulted in one of the largest alkali basalt provinces in the world, where lava fields with sub-alkaline to alkaline affinity are scattered from Syria and the Dead Sea Transform Zone through western Saudi Arabia to Yemen. After the Afar plume emplacement (similar to 30 Ma), volcanism took place in Yemen and progressively propagated northward due to Red Sea rifting-related lithospheric thinning (initiated similar to 27-25 Ma). Few lava fields were emplaced during the Mesozoic, with the oldest 200 Ma volcanic activity recorded in northern Israel. We report results from volcanic pipes in the Marthoum area, east of Harrat Uwayrid, where over a hundred pipes occupy a stratigraphic level in the early Ordovician Saq sandstones. Most of them are circular or elliptical features marked by craters aligned along NW-SE fractures in the sandstone resulting from phreatomagmatic explosions that occurred when rising magma columns came in contact with the water table in the porous sandstone host. These lavas have Sr-Pb-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions far from the Cenozoic Arabian alkaline volcanism field, being considerably more enriched in Nd-Hf and Pb isotopes than any other Arabian Plate lava ever reported. New K-Ar dating constrains their age from Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene, thus anticipating the Afar plume emplacement and the Red Sea rift. Basalt geochemistry indicates that these volcanic eruptions formed from low-degree partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle source triggered by local variations in the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary. This mantle source has a composition similar to the HIMU-like enriched isotopic component reported in the East African Rift and considered to represent the lowermost lithospheric mantle of the Nubian Shield. The generated melt, mixed in different proportions with melt derived from a depleted asthenosphere, produces the HIMU-like character throughout the Cenozoic Arabian alkaline volcanism. Although apparently hidden, this enriched lithospheric component is therefore ubiquitous and widespread in the cratonic roots of the African and Arabian subcontinental mantle.",
1647,"Impact of Urban Sprawl on Agriculture Lands in Greater Cairo Since the 1950s, The Greater Cairo Metropolitan Region (GCMR) has experienced an unprecedented rate of informal urbanization over productive arable lands, forming fragmented landscape and accompanied with significant socioeconomic influences. Recent data show that 62% of Greater Cairo and 87% of Giza are informal settlements resulting from urban sprawl, with 80% of these informal settlements built on privately owned agriculture lands. Beside the direct loss of agricultural land, the fragmented agricultural lands, created by urban expansion, road networks, and constructions, suffers from indirect impacts on the inputs of agricultural processes, such as increased irrigation requirements, soil contamination. This study aims to develop a conceptual framework illustrating the interrelationship between urban sprawl and agricultural activities through a case study on one district (Tersa District) in the Giza governorate. The study implemented both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques as well as water samples analysis. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews with 30 farmers, 50 residents, and governmental authorities to investigate changes in the different facets of agricultural activities over a 10-year period from 2007 to 2017. Changes in agricultural activities were assessed in terms of changes in cultivated land ownership, agricultural laborers, agricultural cooperative organization support to farmers, crop type, and livestock management activities. To evaluate the possible impact of urban sprawl on water quality, water samples in four locations were analyzed. The research affirms that urban sprawl has led to loss of about 19% of Tersa's fertile agricultural lands between 2007 and 2017 and revealed many challenges facing farmers in the remaining fragmented lands due to urban sprawl, including polluted irrigation water, diminishing soil fertility, increased labor wages, reduction of institutional support, and alteration of crop type. The similarity of these challenges with other challenges identified in the international literature provided the needed background to propose a framework exploring the interrelationship between urban sprawl and agricultural activities. This framework can highlight entry points for various interventions to ameliorate and address the negative impact of urban sprawl in remaining agricultural areas. In addition to the most foremost intervention of intensifying efforts to control urban sprawl, ensuring sustained good quality of irrigation water, efficient institutional support, and building channels of communication and trust among members of the communities can support the sustainability of agricultural activities and enhance food security in these areas.",
1648,"Hydrological impacts of climate change in gauged and ungauged watersheds of the Olifants basin: a trading-space-for-time approach Robust projections of climate change impacts on regional hydrology are crucial for water resources management, especially in data-sparse regions. Impact projections have to: (a) be available at gauged and ungauged locations; (b) consider changes in watershed behaviour for different future climates and land uses; and (c) include estimates of uncertainty. We apply a novel water resources modelling framework which combines signature regionalization with the trading of space for time to obtain hydrological projections in ungauged basins and under climate change for the Olifants basin in southern Africa, a UNESCO HELP basin. We find that using statistically downscaled general circulation model (GCM) vs observed climate data leads to only slight deterioration in reliability of runoff projections for the historical period. The framework projects a decrease in regional runoff by -8.7% and -3.9% for A2 and B1 scenarios, respectively, by the end of the century, with, 80% and 67% of GCMs agreeing on the decrease in runoff, respectively.

1649,"Numerical assessment of the potential for future limnic eruptions at lakes Nyos and Monoun, Cameroon, based on regular monitoring data We assessed the potential for limnic eruptions at lakes Nyos and Monoun, Cameroon on the basis of numerical modelling and CO2 profiles obtained by regular monitoring of the lakes. The change through time of the profiles suggests one particular scenario for producing an eruption: a supply of CO2-undersaturated fluid from the lake bottom that induces upwards growth of the CO2-rich bottom layer, leading eventually to CO2 saturation at mid-depths of the lake. By using a numerical model for the ascent of a plume of CO2 bubbles, we found that under realistic conditions (e.g. a profile of CO2 as deduced from the regular monitoring data), a bubble plume generated from the middle depths of the lake can reach the lake surface with a high flux of CO2, which corresponds to a limnic eruption. In addition, we developed a numerical model to investigate how changes in the CO2 concentration at the lake bottom affect the dynamics of a two-phase flow in the controlled degassing pipe, using the recently observed CO2 profiles. This model enables us to estimate the CO2 concentrations at the lake bottom from the heights of fountains that are observable at the lake surface.",
1650,"Removal of Fe and Mn From Polluted Water Sources in Lesotho Using Modified Clays This paper reports the use of unfunctionalized and phenylalanine functionalized clays as an alternative cost effective, environmental friendly and efficient sorbent for the removal of Mn and Fe from polluted drinking water sources in Lesotho. The Mn and Fe metals were adsorbed on two different clays (clay Aa black clay and clay Ba yellow clay) collected from Ha-Teko in Maseru (clay A) and Phoqoane in Mafeteng district (clay B). Comprehensive batch test studies were performed to assess the effect of pH, stirring time and initial concentration of Mn and Fe. The adsorption of the metals was greater at higher pH and equilibrium was reached at pH 8 after 30 min of stirring. The phenylalanine functionalized clays displayed improved adsorption efficiency of up 100% (Fe adsorption using clay A in 30 min) while the unfunctionalized clays gave relatively low adsorption of up to 70% (Fe and Mn adsorption using clay A). The clays, which are present in abundance in Lesotho, can be effectively used for the removal of Fe and Mn from drinking water sources.",
1651,"The impact of groundwater production and exploitation on ecosystem in Azerbaijan The Azerbaijan Republic is located on the western side of the Caspian Sea, in the and climatic zone and feels deficit of general water balance. Due to this, the rational exploitation of fresh and weakly saltish groundwater has great importance. The production and utilization of the groundwater caused negative consequences that affected on natural conditions of different regions. For example, the decrease of the groundwater level in a part of Qusar region has created some ecological problems. In the regions of development of the relict forests the dynamic levels of the groundwater decreased on 25-30 meters. This affected root-inhabitable stratum and as a result led to abrupt aggravation of the ecological situation of the regions. It was required to optimize the production of the groundwater. Another example is Qanikh-Ayrichay field. Here we can notice abnormally high hydraulic interrelation between ground and surface waters, and underground component of the river drain in the natural conditions forms approximately 55-65%. When infringing given conditions by production the groundwater the decrease of their average level forms approximately 50-60 meters. The appeared depression funnels cause tightening of the additional volume of river run-off to the groundwater intake wells, that is damage river run-off. Given volume of the river run-off must not be calculated twice when assessing the common water balance of the region. Opposite situation is observed in the Absheron peninsula where there are almost no fresh water resources. The water demands are met by surface water resources of Samur river and groundwater transfer from Guba-Gusar region of the Republic (more than 200 km from the demand areas). These sources are augmented with water from Kura river in the Ali-Bayramli region (more than 180 km from the demand area), at rates of up to 30 m(3)/sec. Due to the specific hydrogeological conditions, absence of sewerage system and etc., it leads to land subsidence, landslide processes, flooding, and other environmental and social phenomena and abrupt aggravation of the geoecological situation of the peninsula, in the whole. As it has already been mentioned a big part of groundwater in Azerbaijan is utilized for irrigation of agricultural crop. Mostly we notice fresh (up to 1.0 g/l) or weakly saltish (up to 3.0 g/l) hydrocarbonate-sulphate and sulphatehydrocarbonate waters with different cationic composition. The combination of cations form irrigation factors of the groundwater and as a result forms opportunity to utilize it for irrigation of concrete soils. Incorrect calculation of given qualitative parameters in the ""water-rock"" system has led to salinization of the soils of irrigated areas of Mil and Mugan-Salyan plains and accordingly led them to exit from the crop rotation. At present time, melioration of these areas is realizing. Thus, we can certify that production and utilization of the groundwater is essential anthropogenic factor, which influence on geoecological situation of the republic. This factor must be taken into account when forecasting water-related activities in the whole and concerning exploitation of the groundwater, in particular.",

1653,"REINFORCED DESIGN OF AN UNBONDED FLEXIBLE FLOWLINE FOR SHALLOW WATER Flexible pipeline has been widely used in offshore engineering. Comparing to steel pipe, flexible subsea pipeline has some merits such as anti-corrosive, easy laying and recycling. So it is suitable to be used as flowline in shallow water. Especially there are lots of marginal oil fields in shallow water of China. Different from deepwater dynamic riser, flexible pipe for shallow water applications has a low requirement of resisting external pressure. On the other hand, Flexible pipe need to satisfy the requirement of tensile property during installation. Therefore, a kind of simple and economical flexible pipe can be developed to meet the requirement of shallow water application. This paper presents an economical unbonded flexible pipeline, which is helically wound by steel wires. In order to guarantee the safety of the economical flexible pipeline under the laying, installation and working loads, a reinforced design of tensile property is necessary. A helically wounded flat-steel layer is introduced to constrain the steel wire radial deformation and strengthen the axial tensile stiffness of the pipeline. A theoretical model is established to analyze the tension behavior of the flexible pipes and some suggestions are proposed to strengthen the flexible pipe design. Additionally, tensile experiments are carried out for the original and reinforced flexible pipes, which verify the theoretical model and the effectiveness of the reinforced design. The results show that the reinforced pipeline not only meets the tensile requirement during installation for shallow-water applications, but also meets requirements of the minimum bend radius as well as hydrostatic collapse(resistance of the external pressure) with low cost.",
1654,"Effect of Groundwater Iron on Residual Chlorine in Water Treated with Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate Tablets in Rural Bangladesh We assessed the ability of sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) to provide adequate chlorine residual when used to treat groundwater with variable iron concentration. We randomly selected 654 tube wells from nine subdistricts in central Bangladesh to measure groundwater iron concentration and corresponding residual-free chlorine after treating 10 L of groundwater with a 33-mg-NaDCC tablet. We assessed geographical variations of iron concentration using the Kruskal-Wallis test and examined the relationships between the iron concentrations and chlorine residual by quantile regression. We also assessed whether user-reported iron taste in water and staining of storage vessels can capture the presence of iron greater than 3 mg/L (the World Health Organization threshold). The median iron concentration among measured wells was 0.91 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.36-2.01) mg/L and free residual chlorine was 1.3 (IQR: 0.6-1.7) mg/L. The groundwater iron content varied even within small geographical regions. The median free residual chlorine decreased by 0.29 mg/L (95% confidence interval: 0.27, 0.33, P < 0.001) for every 1 mg/L increase in iron concentration. Owner-reported iron staining of the storage vessel had a sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 41%, and negative predictive value of 98% for detecting > 3 mg/L iron in water. Similar findings were observed for user-reported iron taste in water. Our findings reconfirm that chlorination of groundwater that contains iron may result in low-level or no residual. User reports of no iron taste or no staining of storage containers can be used to identify low-iron tube wells suitable for chlorination. Furthermore, research is needed to develop a color-graded visual scale for iron staining that corresponds to different iron concentrations in water.",
1655,"Quality of health care, survival and health outcomes in Ghana This paper analyzes the effect of quality and accessibility of health services and other public infrastructure on the health of children in Ghana. We focus on child survival, child height and weight using data from the Ghana Living Standards Survey. The results suggest an important role for public health policy in eliminating the rural-urban disparities in health status and particularly in improving the health status of rural children and reducing their mortality rates. Increased availability of birth services and other related child programs, as well as Improved water and sanitation infrastructure would have an immediate payoff. The impact of household- and community-level variables on child mortality and child growth was investigated through an analysis of data from the 1988 Ghana Living Standard Survey. Hazard analysis revealed child mortality is highly sensitive to variation in food prices, especially as concerns maize and cassava. A 10% increase in food prices reduces the median child survival time by 14.7%. The price effects are larger and more significant for children living in rural areas and for girls. Having a significant, positive impact on child survival was the availability (hours per week) of child health services. If rural child health service availability equaled the urban mean (11.5 hours/week), the mean survival time of rural children would increase by 9.3%, substantially reducing the rural-urban gap. In addition, child survival was significantly related to the composite measure of the quality of water and sanitation facilities. If these services in rural areas were upgraded to the level found in cities, child survival would increase by almost 10%. Child height for age, and, to a lesser extent, weight for height, was positively affected by health facility size, presence of child health services, and availability of essential drugs as well as the quality of water and sanitation facilities. Both anthropometric measures were highly sensitive to price variation in rural areas, in non-poor as well as poor households. Thus, stabilization and adjustment programs that lead to food price increases are likely to have an adverse effect on children from all income groups. eng",

1657,"Groundwater arsenic contamination in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India Nine districts in West Bengal, India, and 42 districts in Bangladesh have arsenic levels in groundwater above the World Health Organization maximum permissible limit of 50 mu g/L. The area and population of the 42 districts in Bangladesh and the 9 districts in West Bengal are 92,106 km(2) and 79.9 million and 38,865 km(2) and 42.7 million, respectively. In our preliminary study, we have identified 985 arsenic-affected villages in 69 police stations/blocks of nine arsenic-affected districts in West Bengal. In Bangladesh, we have identified 492 affected villages in 141 police stations/blocks of 42 affected districts. To date, we have collected 10,991 water samples from 42 arsenic-affected districts in Bangladesh for analysis, 58,166 water samples from nine arsenic-affected districts in West Bengal. Of the water samples that we analyzed, 59 and 34%, respectively, contained arsenic levels above 50 mu g/L. Thousands of hair, nail, and urine samples From people living in arsenic-affected villages have been analyzed to date; Bangladesh and West Bengal, 33 and 77% samples, on an average, contained arsenic above the normal/toxic level. We surveyed 27 of 42 districts in Bangladesh for arsenic patients; we identified patients with arsenical skin lesions in 25 districts. In West Bengal, we identified patients with lesions in seven of nine districts. We examined people from the affected villages at random for arsenical dermatologic features (11,180 and 29,035 from Bangladesh and West Bengal, respectively); 24.47 and 15.02% of those examined, respectively, had skin lesions. After 10 years of study in West Bengal and 5 in Bangladesh, we feel that we have seen only the tip of iceberg.",
1658,"A Proposal for Green Financing as a Mechanism to Increase Private Participation in Sustainable Water Infrastructure Systems: The Colombian Case Many countries, including Colombia, require new financial mechanisms that lead to increased coverage in supplies of drinking water, particularly in rural areas. However, the establishment of such mechanisms demands new public and private policies that promote and increase financial assets in capital markets. This paper examines how green financial mechanisms can lead to increased coverage of potable water through the funding of new water infrastructure systems in Colombia. Achieving this goal requires both private investment and clean financial mechanisms that promote a low-emissions infrastructure. To address this need, this paper proposes a new financing model that involves green financing, capital markets, and the private and public sectors. In addition, it introduces new policies that the Colombian government should plan to implement to foster private participation and the development of infrastructure-related financial assets. As a result, this paper should contribute to increasing the role of the capital markets and private involvement in the development of a sustainable rural drinking water infrastructure.

1659,"Indicators of Land, Water, Energy and Food (LWEF) Nexus Resource Drivers: A Perspective on Environmental Degradation in the Gidabo Watershed, Southern Ethiopia In Ethiopia, land, water, energy and food (LWEF) nexus resources are under pressure due to population growth, urbanization and unplanned consumption. The effect of this pressure has been a widely discussed topic in nexus resource literature. The evidence shows the predominantly negative impact of this; however, the impact of these factors is less explored from a local scale. As a result, securing nexus resources is becoming a serious challenge for the country. This necessitates the identification of the driving factors for the sustainable utilization of scarce LWEF nexus resources. Our study provides a systemic look at the driving factor indicators that induce nexus resource degradation. We use the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to develop the indicators' weights, and use a Path Analysis Model (PAM) to quantitatively estimate the effect of the driving factor indicators on the LWEF nexus resources. The results indicate that social (48%), economic (19%), and policy and institutional changes (14%) are the major nexus resource driving factor indicators. The path analysis results indicate that among the social driving factor indicators, population growth and consumption patterns have a significant direct effect on the LWEF nexus, with path coefficients of 0.15 and 0.089, respectively. Similarly, the potential of LWEF nexus resources is also influenced by the institutional and policy change drivers, such as outdated legislation and poor institutional structure, with path coefficients of 0.46 and 0.39, respectively. This implies that population growth and consumption patterns are the leading social drivers, while outdated legislation and poor institutional structures are the institutional and policies change drivers which have a potential impact on LWEF nexus resource degradation. Similarly, other driving factors such as environmental, economic and technological factors also affect nexus resources to varying degrees. The findings of our study show the benefits of managing the identified driving factors for the protection of LWEF nexus resources, which have close links with human health and the environment. In order to alleviate the adverse effects of driving factors, all stakeholders need to show permanent individual and collective commitment. Furthermore, we underline the necessity of applying LWEF nexus approaches to the management of these drivers, and to optimize the environmental and social outcomes.",
1660,"Trends of precipitation intensity and frequency in hydrological regions of China from 1956 to 2005 Daily precipitation data of 741 meteorological stations ranging from 1956 to 2005 were used to run a preliminary investigation of changes in temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation intensity and frequency in ten hydrological regions in China. Average annual and seasonal spatial values of indices of precipitation characteristics (i.e. precipitation amount, intensity and frequency) were obtained using a Kriging interpolation method. Temporal tendencies were calculated by Mann-Kendall's method. The trends of extreme rainfall events and precipitation-based droughts were also discussed in ten hydrological regions using the maximum daily precipitation and dry spell duration in a year. Results show that precipitation intensity has significant increasing trends while precipitation frequency has significant decreasing trends over China. Meanwhile precipitation has a major decline in autumn and a slight increase in winter. Both extreme rainfall events and precipitation-based droughts show a general increasing trend. The aggravated spatial and temporal unevenly distributed precipitation leads to more water shortage as well as floods in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1661,"Geography matters for sanitation! Spatial heterogeneity of the district-level correlates of open defecation in India This paper quantitatively analyzes the spatial heterogeneity of district-level correlates of open defecation in rural India. We employ standard non-spatial regression, spatially explicit regressions and multi-scale geographically weighted regression to compare the stability of measurable correlates of open defecation across these different methods as well as across analyzed spatial units. Attributes like ownership of household assets, drinking water inaccessibility and prevalent literacy rates were identified as the most stable district-level correlates of open defecation. Our results also demonstrated the relevance of our hypotheses about (a) possible negative sanitation externalities stemming from the co-concentration of Scheduled Caste communities and other communities in densely populated rural districts, and (b) possible positive sanitation externalities stemming from the co-concentration of Muslim and non-Muslim communities in densely populated districts. Overall, however, our analyses demonstrate notable spatial clustering and significant spatial non-stationarity of examined variables. Therefore, in our opinion, research findings that ignore spatial heterogeneity of sanitation drivers provide incomplete information for policy development and implementation.",
1662,"Fouling Mitigation on Different Heat Exchanging Surfaces Materials Used in the Hybrid Cooling Tower Test Facility Fouling problems are of major concern to many industries using water and heat, especially in cooling processes. Once scale forms on a heat transfer surface, at least two major problems associated with the scale occur. The first problem is the deterioration of the heat transfer equipment performance due to the much lower thermal conductivity of scale compared to that of pipe materials. The second major problem is that a small change in the tube diameter substantially increases the pressure drop across the water piping system. The fouling for cooling towers in CSP plants is an influential factor on whether the equipment is performed or not. Beside the water cooling quality, the tube material surfaces are being allowed increasing attention to evaluating the fouling phenomena. Those parameters can in fact highly affect the performance of a cooling tower; hence, it is central to evaluate how the used heat exchanger tube materials will be impacted by fouling factors. Although fouling can have an impact on a cooling tower performance through various ways, including water flow, air/water temperatures, water quality, and tubes materials. In this paper, we are focusing our attention to the fouling scale and its effect on the overall heat transfer coefficient, heat transfer and fouling resistance of deposits fouling through a comparative study based on SEM images, X-ray diffraction analysis and experimental results of polymers and galvanized heat surface materials. In order to understand the fouling behavior, an apparatus scale unit of a hybrid cooling tower designed for CSP plants was installed in the Green Energy Park (GEP) research platform, located in Benguerir, Morocco, in the framework of the MinwaterCSP project (supported by EU H2020). In this scope, the fouling deposits on the polymer and galvanized steel tubes were investigated.",
1663,"Suspected lead poisoning in two captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) in South Africa, in 2008 and 2013 Whilst lead poisoning in raptors, scavenging birds and waterfowl is well studied and common knowledge, there is surprisingly little literature detailing the risk to mammalian scavengers and captive carnivores fed hunted meat. This case report describes the death of two captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) following acute onset of nervous symptoms. Clinical signs included hyper-excitability, seizures, arched back, tail held abnormally high and hyper-salivation. Necropsy findings included bullets or a bullet in their stomachs. Kidney and liver lead levels from one cheetah (15.6 ppm and 17 ppm respectively) were consistent with a diagnosis of lead poisoning; liver from the second cheetah was not available for testing. Both animals were routinely fed hunted antelope or game birds. This is the first report of oral lead poisoning in captive large carnivores, although these are unlikely to be the first cases. Without awareness of the risks of feeding hunted game, lead exposure will continue to be an underdiagnosed reality in the rehabilitation of endangered carnivores.",
1664,"Full-scale thermophilic aerobic co-composting of blue-green algae sludge with livestock faeces and straw A high incidence of harmful algal bloom in eutrophic surface waters causes many environmental problems. Thermophilic aerobic composting enables effective treatment and disposal of algal sludge that remains after the dewatering of algae slurries, and provides a value-added organic fertiliser. Previous studies have either only dealt with the composting of a single waste component or were conducted at a lab-/pilot-scale; however, this work is a comprehensive assessment of full-scale mechanized thermophilic aerobic co-composting of algal sludge and other typical biomass-based wastes, including chicken faeces and rice straw, in a water-rich rural area in the Tai lake basin, China. With the optimised feedstock material mass ratio (6.0:1.8:1.0 for straw:algae:faeces; initial C/N ratio of 20; and initial moisture of 60Â wt%), the co-composting process effectively achieved the reduction, harmlessness, and reuse of waste. The moisture content (28.36Â wt% of wet weight), organic matter content (57.91Â wt% of dried weight), total nutrient content (6.59Â wt% for TNÂ +Â TPÂ +Â TK of dried weight), and heavy metal contents as well as the pH of the final product fully met the Chinese National Agricultural Organic Fertiliser Standard requirements. The reduction rates of microcystin and toxic volatile fatty acid contents were higher than 99.5%, and the seed germination index of the product was 114.5%. A notable economic benefit with a gross profit margin of 167-434% of the process was highlighted. Investigation of the associated mechanisms, including statistical analysis, spectral characterisation, micro-morphological observation, and microbial community analysis, revealed that a decreased particle sizes with a looser structure and an efficient humification effect, resulting from the work of several identified dominant microbial species, contributed to the high product quality. The current study provided a demonstration of the promising full-scale co-composting technology for comprehensive management of the environment in water-rich rural areas and the construction of a sustainable watershed.",
1665,"Methane emission from a flooded field of eastern India as influenced by planting date and age of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings Flooded paddy is considered to be one of the major anthropogenic sources of atmospheric methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. Emission of CH4 from flooded rice soils is affected by a multitude of factors including crop management practices. In a field study, CH4 fluxes from a sub-humid tropical flooded field of Cuttack, eastern India, as affected by planting with 20 and 35-day old rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings on two sets of planting dates were measured with the closed chamber method in 2002-2003 encompassing wet (kharif) season, 2002 and dry (rabi) season, 2003. In the wet season of 2002, CH4 emission from staggered planting was measured with two varieties viz. Lalat and Gayatri, while during the dry season of 2003, the experiment was conducted with cv. Lalat. CH4 emission was low from plots planted to aged seedlings (35-day) as well as seedlings transplanted late in both sets of experiments that were transplanted to the main field with an interval of 15 days during the two growing seasons. Cumulative CH4 emission from early- and late-transplanted plots during wet season, 2002 was 408.77 and 308.58 kg ha(-1) and during the dry season, 2003 was 431.35 and 328.66 kg ha(-1), respectively. Early transplanted seedlings had higher number of tillers and exhibited low soil redox (Eh) potential thereby favouring higher CH4 emission. There was no statistically significant yield reduction due to transplanting of aged seedlings or planting late over that of young seedlings planted early. Our results suggest that in rainfed rice cultivation, as practiced in greater part of Asia and Africa, transplanting late with comparatively aged seedlings could lead to a considerable reduction in CH4 emission without being detrimental to the yield.

1666,"Leachate of Demolition Waste Demolition waste contains not only non-hazardous and uncontaminated material but also consists a small fraction of residual hazardous materials that need to be separated, processed or disposed of. The demolition wastes are utilized as aggregates in new concrete and road construction application, initial resources in reuse construction and disposal materials of landfill. When demolition wastes are disposed in unprotected landfills can cause environmental and health problems as leaching that may have consequence in groundwater and soil. The majority of demolition wastes researches in Indonesia addressed its classification, quantification and causes, while environmental effect do not explore yet. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate demolition waste in Indonesia especially its leaching effects. This preliminary research is showing result of leaching test of demolition waste using toxicity characteristic leaching procedure on copper, zinc, lead, sulphate, chloride and fluoride. A concentration of lead showed in higher level (0.65 mg/L) than Indonesian standard of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (0.50 mg/L). Some elements were detected reach near and over the limit value of drinking water standard, such as sulphate and fluoride. Sorting is better to do to minimize the risk of hazardous waste from demolition waste.",
1667,"Arsenic toxicity scenario and challenges for Bangladesh Bangladesh is one of the worst arsenic affected countries in the world. In an analysis of tropical ground water in Laxmipur in greater Noakhali, arsenic contamination varied from 30 mg/L to over 72 mg/L. The lowest arsenic content was 30.5 mg/L which was more than 60 times the Bangladesh permissible limit. According to WHO, in Bangladesh 25 million people are exposed to high arsenic concentration (> 50 mu g/L) in drinking water. Directorate General of Health Services ( 2010) identified 38,320 patients. Screening all the drinking water points of ground water sources for arsenic contamination, ensuring arsenic safe drinking water for affected population and management of arsenicosis patients are serious public health challenges for the government of Bangladesh.",
1668,"Nonlinear regression approach to evaluate nutrient delivery coefficient Implementation of the Korean Total Maximum Daily Load Act calls for new tools to quantify nutrient losses from diffuse sources at a river basin district scale. In this study, it was elucidated that the nonlinear regression model (NRM) reduces the uncertainty of the boundary conditions of the water quality model. The NRM was proposed to analyse the delivery coefficients of surface waters and retention coefficients of pollutants. Delivery coefficient of pollution load was considered as a function of two variables: the watershed form ratio, S(f), which is a measurable geomorphologic variable and the retention coefficient, phi, which is an empirical constant representing the basin-wide retarding capacity of pollutant wash-off. This model was applied on the Geum River, one of the major basins in South Korea. The QUAL2E was used to simulate stream water quality using NRM. In this paper, we elucidate the possibility to use a nonlinear regression model for delivery and retention of nutrients in a drainage basin characterized as both data-rich and data-poor, and the magnitude of the nutrient loads and sources has been uncertain for a long time.",
1669,"Decorated graphene with aluminum fumarate metal organic framework as a superior non-toxic agent for efficient removal of Congo Red dye from wastewater Nowadays, disposal of highly stable toxic dyes into the ecosystem and water sources has become a great concern for our health, while many attempts were conducted to remove these kinds of pollutants from the ecosystem through practical scientific protocols. Herein, for the first time, we decorated the graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with the highly porous aluminum fumarate (AlF) metal organic framework (AlF MOF) toward efficient and high yield removal of the Congo Red (CR) dye ((3,3'-([1,1'-biphenyl]z-4,4'-diyl)bis(4-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid)) as a severely toxic and even carcinogenic substance from aqueous media. In this case, developed absorbers including AlF, AlF-GO and AlF-rGO were well-characterized through diverse analyses that confirmed their successful synthesis and also superior specific surface area and porosity, where their respective BET surface areas found to be 973.39, 917.79 and 951.88 m(2). g(-1). Additionally, outcome of further analyses showed that the experimental data are well fitted with Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-secondorder kinetic model which show that the absorption process occur through chemisorption via uniform energetic absorption sites. Further evaluations showed that the AlF and its derived composites with GO and rGO can completely remove the CR dye at optimum conditions (more than 99% yield) and reach to the absorption capacity of about 93.45, 102.04 and 178.57 mg.g(-1) for concentrations between 1-40 mu g.mL(-1) at optimum conditions, which highlight their superior sensitivity. Additionally, for the first time it was also reported that the AlF composite with GO is fully non-toxic.",
1670,"Wastewater-based monitoring of illicit drug consumption in Istanbul: Preliminary results from two districts Wastewater-based epidemiology is a well-established and complementary approach for monitoring illicit drug use in the general population. In this study, amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (METH), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine (COC) (from benzoylecgonine), and cannabis (from THC-COOH) consumption levels were investigated for the first time in Turkey (Istanbul). A solid-phase extraction method was applied to influent wastewater samples collected from two districts, Beyoglu and Catalca. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was conducted with electrospray ionization in positive mode. Calibration curves were acquired in linear form with >0.999 correlation coefficients. Limit of detection levels were measured as 0.91-151â€¯ng/L, and limit of quantitation levels were in the range of 3 to 500â€¯ng/L. Solid-phase extraction recovery and repeatability experiments were achieved by spiking the mix solution to different concentrations (50, 250, 750â€¯ng/L) in 50â€¯mL tap water and wastewater (500, 1000â€¯ng/L) samples in six replicates. The method was optimized, and recoveries were found to be over 80% for all six substances with up to 11.9% relative standard deviation. According to the real sample results, cannabis was found to be the most abused illicit substance among the analytes. The mean consumptions of the two districts, including seven consecutive days for AMP, METH, MDMA, COC, and cannabis, were found to be 27.2, 322, 331, 385, and 1224â€¯mg/day/1000 inhabitants, respectively. In this presented study, all targeted compounds were analyzed simultaneously with the same analytical conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to present illicit drug consumption data from Istanbul.",
1671,"Peri-urban water and sanitation services: Policy, planning and method More than 2.6 billion people in the developing world lack access to safe water and sanitation services. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target is to halve the number of people without access to improved services such as a sustainable source of water supply and connection to a sewer network by 2015. That target is unlikely to be met. If there is anything that can be learnt from European development experience it is that institutional reform occurs incrementally when politically enfranchised urban populations perceive a threat to their material well-being due to contamination of water sources. Peri-urban Water and Sanitation Services, a collection of papers initially developed to support a distance-learning course at UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, Delft, The Netherlands, challenges professionals to pursue water services dilemmas within a broader developmental framework that addresses issues of autonomy and accountability intrinsic to intergovernmental relations. This book draws on literature at the interface of common pool resources, co-production, new public management and political ecology to discuss important policy concerns that relate to rural-urban transformation, budget support, wastewater reuse and performance benchmarking. 'This collection of work by some of the most important researchers on socio-ecological aspects of water and sanitation is timely. By highlighting the importance of behaviour, society and ecology on the management of water and sanitation, the editors are highlighting an area of work that has largely been neglected. For instance, why is it that so many technical fixes exist, and yet in practice, few successful projects are ever brought to scale?' Mark Redwood, Program Leader, Urban Poverty and Environment Program, International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada 'With global urban population now larger than rural, opening of public-private relationships and opportunities, and the globalisation of technology and capital, can needs of citizens for clean and affordable water and sanitation services be met?

1672,"The Non-carcinogenic Risk of Cadmium in Bottled Water in Different Age Groups Humans: Bandar Abbas City, Iran INTRODUCTION: The presence of heavy metals such as cadmium in drinking water resources can be dangerous for human because of toxicity and biological accumulation. The consumption of water which contains Cd in high concentration can lead to Bone and Kidney diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this present study, the researcher collected 432 samples of bottled water in the popular marks in summer and winter from the surface of Bandar Abbas. The cadmium concentration was measured by atomic absorption Spectrophotometer in model DR2800 through the Dithizone method. CDI, R and HQ which are caused by Cd for adult men, women and children, have been calculated and evaluated through the equations of EPA and WHO. RESULTS: Mean of 1.73Â±0.19 Âµg/l (MÂ±SE) is lower than the standard of WHO and EPA. However, 33.2% of all the samples have concentrations more than the standard limit of WHO, and the concentrations of 22.4% of the samples are more than EPA's standard. The CDI for different age groups is as following manner; Children>adult women>adult men. The CDI in children is more than twice as much as in the CDI for adult men and women. The mean of HQ order for different age groups is children>adult men>adult women. Since HQ of adult men (34E-5), adult women (31E-5) and children (84E-5), is lower than 1. CONCLUSION: It can be said that the population of Bandar Abbas is in a safe area regarding the HQ of the bottled water's cadmium.",
1673,"History, Current Situation and Challenges of Gold Mining in Ecuador's Litoral Region Gold mining in Ecuador has been present in the country since Inca times; over the years interest in the mineral has increased, leading to the creation of legislation to control the mining sector in a safe manner. The Litoral region consists of seven provinces, six of which have registered gold concessions; the most affected provinces are El Oro and Esmeraldas. The objective of this study was to analyze the historical and current situation of artisanal and industrial gold mining in the Litoral region of Ecuador. Different methodologies were used for the elaboration of this study, including bibliographic review, grey literature, field interviews and a validation of expert judgment. The main results indicate that El Oro and Esmeraldas are essentially the most conflictive areas in the region, as they have sometimes had to establish precautionary measures due to the risks caused by illegal mining. In addition, in both areas there is a great socioeconomic impact ranging from lack of opportunities, forgetfulness, migration, emigration, and violation of rights, among others. With respect to environmental impacts, the study highlights the contamination of water sources (which leads to a lack of drinking water for people), and damage to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the study concludes that the authorities should control the mining sector more by implementing more laws and carrying out inspections to put an end to illegal gold mining, in order to improve the situation in the areas.",
1674,"Precipitation and temperature drive seasonal variation in bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the planktonic food webs of a subtropical shallow eutrophic lake in China Hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) are toxic and ubiquitous in aquatic environments and pose great risks to aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation by plankton is the first step for HOCs to enter aquatic food webs. Trophic status is considered to dominate variations in bioaccumulation of HOCs in plankton in temperate and frigid deep oligotrophic waters. However, long-term driving factors for bioaccumulation of HOCs in planktonic food webs of subtropical shallow eutrophic waters have not been well investigated. China has the largest subtropical lake density in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to limited field data, long-term variations in the bioaccumulation of HOCs in these lakes are almost unknown. Here we take Lake Xuanwu as an example to investigate long-term variations in the bioaccumulation, and biomagnification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) in planktonic food webs of subtropical shallow eutrophic lakes in China, and elucidate the driving factors. Our results indicate that temperature rather than nutrients dominates long-term dynamics of planktonic biomass in this lake. Precipitation significantly enhances the concentrations of the PAHs, and total suspended particles, and consequently affects the distribution of the PAHs in the water column. Biomass dilution induced by temperature dominates bioaccumulation of the PAHs by both phytoplankton and zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans). Biomagnification of the PAHs from phytoplankton to zooplankton is positively correlated with temperature. Our study suggests that temperature and precipitation drive long-term variations in the bioaccumulation of the PAHs in the planktonic food webs of this subtropical shallow eutrophic lake. Lake Xuanwu has a similar mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, sunshine duration, and nutrient levels as other subtropical shallow eutrophic lakes in China. This study may also help to understand the bioaccumulation of HOCs in planktonic food webs of other subtropical shallow eutrophic lakes.",
1675,"Policy re-directions for sustainable resource use: The rice-wheat cropping system of the indo-gangetic plains The last three decades or more have witnessed the phenomenal growth of cereal crop productivity in the developing world, particularly for rice and wheat in Asia. High levels of investments in research and infrastructure development, especially irrigation infrastructure, resulted in the rapid intensification of the lowlands. Consequently, the irrigated and the high rainfall lowland environments became the primary source of food supply for Asia's escalating population. The emergence of the rice-wheat system in South Asia as the most important source of food supply, is a testament to the success of the Green revolution in wheat and rice. Recent signs indicate, however, a slow down in productivity growth of the primary cereals, rice and wheat, especially in the intensively cultivated lowlands of Asia, and particularly in the intensively cultivated rice-wheat zones of South Asia. Slackening of infrastructure and research investments and reduced policy support partly explain the sluggish growth. This paper argues that in addition to the above factors, degradation of the lowland resource base due to intensive use, over the long term, also contributes to declining productivity growth rates. Intensification per se is not the root cause of lowland resource base degradation, but rather the policy environment that encouraged inappropriate land use and injudicious input use, especially water and chemical fertilizers. Trade policies, output price policies as well as input subsidies have all contributed to the unsustainable use of the lowlands. The dual goals of food self-sufficiency and sustainable resource management are often mutually incompatible. Policies designed for achieving food self-sufficiency tend to undervalue goods not traded internationally, especially land and labor resources. As a result, food self-sufficiency in countries with an exhausted land frontier, particularly the countries of South Asia, came at a high ecological and environmental cost. Appropriate policy reform, both at the macro as well as at the sector level will go a long way towards arresting and possibly reversing the current degradation trends. This paper provides an extensive review of the existing evidence on intensification induced degradation in the rice-wheat systems of the Indo-Gangetic plains of South Asia. Policy re-directions and corrections that can contribute to arresting and/or reversing the current degradation trends are recommended. Â© 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.",
1676,"Natural zeolites in manganese removal Many water sources in Mexico have iron and manganese levels that excede those specified for drinking water in the Official Mexican Standard, NOM-127-SSA. These elements can cause a series of echnical, economic and social problems. Iron and manganese incrustations in well and distribution networks reduce their capacity and effect the color and flavor of the water distributed to the users. The methods commonly used to remove these elements have limitatious with respect to cost and efficiency Often the treated water still does not fulfill the aforementioned standard. To assist in the solution o this problem, this study proposes a technology that consists of a filter made of natural ciinoptilolitic zeolite covered with manganese oxide. The filer was evaluated for iron and manganese removal efficiency effects of operating rates and granule size on production and the dosis of oxidante requied for regenertion of the filter media. With this method, up to 96% of the iron and more than 95% of the manganese were removed. The residual concentrations were below the levels indicated in NOM-127-SSA. The two contaminants are removed in the filter bed by adsorption-oxidation reactions. The study identified the general reaction involving manganese removal during the filtration process.",
1677,"Mapping the Knowledge and Understanding of Menarche, Menstrual Hygiene and Menstrual Health Among Adolescent Girls in Low- and Middle-Income Countries This review aims to answer the following questions: (1) how knowledgeable are adolescent girls in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) about menstruation and how prepared are they for reaching menarche, (2) who are their sources of information regarding menstruation, (3) how well do the adults around them respond to their information needs, (4) what negative health and social effects do adolescents experience as a result of menstruation, and (5) how do adolescents respond when they experience these negative effects and what practices do they develop as a result? Using a structured search strategy, articles that investigate young girlsâ€™ preparedness for menarche, knowledge of menstruation, and practices surrounding menstrual hygiene in LMIC were identified. A total of 81 studies published in peer-reviewed journals between the years 2000 and 2015 that describe the experiences of adolescent girls from 25 different countries were included. Adolescent girls in LMIC are often uninformed and unprepared for menarche. Information is primarily obtained from mothers and other female family members who are not necessarily well equipped to fill gaps in girlsâ€™ knowledge. Exclusion and shame lead to misconceptions and unhygienic practices during menstruation. Rather than seek medical consultation, girls tend to miss school, self-medicate, and refrain from social interaction. Also problematic is that relatives and teachers are often not prepared to respond to the needs of girls. LMIC must recognize that lack of preparation, knowledge, and poor practices surrounding menstruation are key impediments not only to girlsâ€™ education, but also to self-confidence and personal development. In addition to investment in private latrines with clean water for girls in both schools and communities, countries must consider how to improve the provision of knowledge and understanding and how to better respond to the needs of adolescent girls.",
1678,"Environmental risk factors and Parkinson's disease: A case-control study in Taiwan To explore environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) in Taiwan, we investigated 120 patients with PD and 240 hospital control subjects matched with patients on age (+/-2 years) and sex. Based on a structured open-ended questionnaire, we carried out standardized interviews to obtain history of exposure to environmental factors, including place of residence, source of drinking water, and environmental and occupational exposures to various agricultural chemicals. In the univariate analysis, the history of living in a rural environment, farming, use of herbicides/pesticides, and use of paraquat were associated with an increased PD risk in a dose-response relationship. After adjustment for multiple risk factors through conditional logistic regression, the biological gradient between PD and previous uses of herbicides/pesticides and paraquat remained significant. The PD risk was greater among subjects who had used paraquat and other herbicides/pesticides than those who had used herbicides/pesticides other than paraquat. There were no significant differences in occupational exposures to chemicals, heavy metals, and minerals between PD patients and matched control subjects. The duration of drinking well water and alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with PD. There was an inverse relationship between cigarette smoking and PD. Environmental factors, especially exposures to paraquat and herbicides/pesticides, may play important roles in the development of PD in Taiwan.",
1679,"Bioluminescent yeast estrogen assay (BLYES) as a sensitive tool to monitor surface and drinking water for estrogenicity Estrogenic Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) are a concern due to their ubiquity and recognized adverse effects to humans and wildlife. Methods to assess exposure to and associated risks of their presence in aquatic environment are still under development. The aim of this work is to assess estrogenicity of raw and treated waters with different degrees of pollution. Chemical analyses of selected EDCs were performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and estrogenic activity was evaluated using in vitro bioluminescent yeast estrogen assay (BLYES). Most raw water samples (18/20) presented at least one EDC and 16 rendered positive in BLYES. When EDCs were detected, the bioassay usually provided a positive response, except when only bisphenol A was detected at low concentrations. The highest values of estrogenic activity were detected in the most polluted sites. The maximum estrogenic activity observed was 8.7 ng equiv. of E2 L(-1). We compared potencies observed in the bioassay to the relative potency of target compounds and their concentrations failed to fully explain the biological response. This indicates that bioassay is more sensitive than the chemical approach either detecting estrogenic target compounds at lower concentrations, other non-target compounds or even synergistic effects, which should be considered on further investigations. We have not detected either estrogenic activity or estrogenic compounds in drinking water. BLYES showed good sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.1 ng equiv. E2 L(-1) and it seems to be a suitable tool for water monitoring.",
1680,"Volcanism as a prime cause of mass extinctions: Retrospectives and perspectives In recent models of earth-system crises, the correlation between the major Phanerozoic mass extinctions and large igneous provinces has been well established. Specifically, pulsed massive exhalations of large amounts of volcanogenic CO2 transformed Earth's atmosphere, leading to an excessive greenhouse effect and global warming, combined with slowed oceanic circulation, oxygen deficiency, and seawater acidification. In a historical context, however, the path leading to this neocatastrophic doctrine, traced by way of ever-more-convincing proofs (in recent years, via mercury anomalies), was convoluted for many objective and notional-personal reasons. From the late eighteenth century to the revolutionary 1980s, the reception of this conceptual route in the English-language mainstream science was determined principally by the rise and fall of the orthodox nonprogressive (steady-state) paradigm of the Lyellian uniformitarian. The main cognitive steps, pioneered frequently in continental Europe, included such principal conclusions as: (1) volcanic eruptions are a natural process, consisting of heat being vented from a central incandescent core, itself a relic of an initial nebular state; (2) cataclysmic phenomena were far more intense in the geologic past, both in orogenic and nonorogenic time intervals, with a dominant nonactualistic style of fissure-type effusive activity in intraplate settings, recorded in vast trap-type basalt successions (= large igneous provinces); (3) volcanogenic gaseous emanations, dominated by carbon dioxide and water vapor, had a strong impact on the global climate in the geological past toward the global warmth mode; and (4) this ""volcanic greenhouse"" was deleteriously augmented by several forms of immanent stress feedback (resulting in anoxia, acidification, hypercapnia, acid rains, ultraviolet radiation, etc.). Overall, diverse global ecosystem interactions, combined with the updated large igneous province scenario, can elucidate all major destructive factors in the biosphere, such as regressive versus transgressive sea-level changes and cooling versus warming climatic responses. Notwithstanding the particularity of each major biodiversity crisis in the Phanerozoic, however, a greenhouse/icehouse volcanism-driven catastrophe is a well-confirmed key toward better understanding these biotic turnovers over a variety of time scales and feedbacks. The holistic volcanic ""press-pulse"" model involves the joint action of two different types of stress factors: long-lived (""press"") large igneous provinces and a variety of critically sudden (""pulse"") disturbances. Therefore, the killing effectiveness of volcanic cataclysm should be viewed not only by the large igneous province size but also by their host geology, magma plumbing system, and eruption dynamics, determining the magnitude and composition of disastrous thermogenic outgassing. In search of possible pulse signals, emphasis has recently been placed on large igneous province-related, volatile-rich, mafic-ultramafic intrusions (owing to the great fluid-bearing capacity of their magmas) and sill-type intrusions (resulting in the most-effective devolatilization of sedimentary rocks). A simultaneous burst of arc magmatism and coeval impact of arc-continent collisions (especially in tropical domain) on global weatherability are additional cumulative cataclysmic stimuli awaiting more rigorous numerical simulations.",
1681,"Identification of dimethylarsinous and monomethylarsonous acids in human urine of the arsenic-affected areas in West Bengal, India A speciation technique for arsenic has been developed using an anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography/inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometer (HPLC/ICP MS). Under optimized conditions, eight arsenic species [arsenocholine, arsenobetaine, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)), dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)), monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), arsenite (As(III)), and arsenate (As(V))] can be separated with isocratic elution within 10 min. The detection limit of arsenic compounds was 0.14-0.33 microg/L. To validate the method, Standard Reference Material in freeze-dried urine, SRM-2670, containing both normal and elevated levels of arsenic was analyzed. The method was applied to determine arsenic species in urine samples from three arsenic-affected districts of West Bengal, India. Both DMA(III) and MMA(III) were detected directly (i.e., without any prechemical treatment) for the first time in the urine of some humans exposed to inorganic arsenic through their drinking water. Of 428 subjects, MMA(III) was found in 48% and DMA(III) in 72%. Our results indicate the following. (1) Since MMA(III) and DMA(III) are more toxic than inorganic arsenic, it is essential to re-evaluate the hypothesis that methylation is the detoxification pathway for inorganic arsenic. (2) Since MMA(V) reductase with glutathione (GSH) is responsible for conversion of MMA(V) to MMA(III) in vivo, is DMA(V) reductase with GSH responsible for conversion of DMA(V) to DMA(III) in vivo? (3) Since DMA(III) forms iron-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) which causes DNA damage in vivo, DMA(III) may be responsible for arsenic carcinogenesis in human.",
1682,"Modeling Multi-Event Non-Point Source Pollution in a Data-Scarce Catchment Using ANN and Entropy Analysis Event-based runoff-pollutant relationships have been the key for water quality management, but the scarcity of measured data results in poor model performance, especially for multiple rainfall events. In this study, a new framework was proposed for event-based non-point source (NPS) prediction and evaluation. The artificial neural network (ANN) was used to extend the runoff-pollutant relationship from complete data events to other data-scarce events. The interpolation method was then used to solve the problem of tail deviation in the simulated pollutographs. In addition, the entropy method was utilized to train the ANN for comprehensive evaluations. A case study was performed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. Results showed that the ANN performed well in the NPS simulation, especially for light rainfall events, and the phosphorus predictions were always more accurate than the nitrogen predictions under scarce data conditions. In addition, peak pollutant data scarcity had a significant impact on the model performance. Furthermore, these traditional indicators would lead to certain information loss during the model evaluation, but the entropy weighting method could provide a more accurate model evaluation. These results would be valuable for monitoring schemes and the quantitation of event-based NPS pollution, especially in data-poor catchments.",
1683,"Digital Radiography Using Digital Detector Arrays Fulfills Critical Applications for Offshore Pipelines Digital radiography in the inspection of welded pipes to be installed under deep water offshore gas and oil pipelines, like a presalt in Brazil, in the paper has been investigated. The aim is to use digital radiography for nondestructive testing of welds as it is already in use in the medical, aerospace, security, automotive, and petrochemical sectors. Among the current options, the DDA (Digital Detector Array) is considered as one of the best solutions to replace industrial films, as well as to increase the sensitivity to reduce the inspection cycle time. This paper shows the results of this new technique, comparing it to radiography with industrial films systems. In this paper, 20 test specimens of longitudinal welded pipe joints, specially prepared with artificial defects like cracks, lack of fusion, lack of penetration, and porosities and slag inclusions with varying dimensions and in 06 different base metal wall thicknesses, were tested and a comparison of the techniques was made. These experiments verified the purposed rules for parameter definitions and selections to control the required digital radiographic image quality as described in the draft international standard ISO/DIS 10893-7. This draft is first standard establishing the parameters for digital radiography on weld seam of welded steel pipes for pressure purposes to be used on gas and oil pipelines.",
1684,"Silica alteration zones in the Barberton greenstone belt: A window into subseafloor processes 3.5-3.3 Ga ago Silicification of volcanic rocks, ranging from komathtic to dacitic in composition, is a common phenomenon of the 3.5 to 3.2 Ga old volcano-sedimentary succession of the Barberton greenstone belt. Silica enrichment occurs in zones several tens of metres thick at the top of volcanic sequences that are capped by sedimentary chert horizons. SiO2 contents increase upsection, from the original igneous value up to 92%. Silicification is associated with a depletion of most elements commonly mobile during water-rock interaction, while K2O, Rb and Ba are enriched in these zones. Some transition metals (Sc, V, and Cr) were immobile, whereas Ni and Co and some other metals (Cu, Zn) were mobile and are depleted. The delta O-18 values of volcanic rocks show a positive linear relationship with silica content and range from 9.0 to 17.3 parts per thousand. The element depletion-enrichment patterns and oxygen isotope data indicate low-temperature (c. 100-150 degrees C) hydrothermal processes for the origin of the alteration zones. The loss of most elements Coupled with the addition of SiO2 as well as REE systematics indicate high water-rock ratios and a fluid REE composition typical of Archaean seawater that had a delta O-18 Value of similar to 0 parts per thousand. Hydrothermal activity is attributed to heat derived from cooling of volcanic rocks and a high regional heat flow in an oceanic plateau-like setting and resulted in the establishment of shallow subseafloor convection cells. Diffuse venting of hydrothermal fluids over broad areas of the ancient ocean floor provided an ideal environment for both seafloor and subsurface biota 3.5 Ga ago. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1685,"Environmental chronic exposure to metals and effects on attention and executive function in the general population Heavy metals are neurotoxic, associated with brain dysfunction, and have been linked with cognitive decline in adults. This study was aimed to characterize chronic exposure to metals (Cd, Be, Co, Hg, Sn, V, Al, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and metalloids (As, B, Sb) and assess its impact on cognitive performance of Tehran's residents, capital of Iran. Scalp hair samples gathered from 200 volunteered participants (110 men and 90 women), aged 14-70Â years and quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Attention and executive function, two measures of cognitive performance, were characterized using the trail making test (TMT) part A and B, respectively. Mental flexibility was characterized as the Delta TMT B-A scores and cognitive efficiency or dissimulation as the ration between TMT B and A scores. A comprehensive questionnaire was used to gather information on demographic and socioeconomic as well as lifestyle and health status. The highest and lowest mean concentrations were observed for B (325Â Î¼g/g) and As (0.29Â Î¼g/g), respectively. Results indicated that chronic metal exposure measured in hair changed significantly based on gender and age (pÂ <Â 0.05). The levels of Cr, Fe, Ni, Si, Hg, Pb and B were significantly higher in males' hair, whereas those of Ag and Ba were greater in females' hair (pÂ <Â 0.05). The results of the cognitive TMT test were significantly different between gender and age groups (pÂ <Â 0.05). Moreover, results revealed that As, Hg, Mn, and Pb levels in hair were significantly associated with poorer participants' performance scores in the TMT test (pÂ <Â 0.05). Age, gender, cigarette smoking, water-pipe smoking, traffic density in the area of residence, and dental amalgam filling were significant factors affecting the TMT test scores. The results suggest that chronic exposure to metals has detrimental effects on attention, executive function, mental flexibility and cognitive efficiency.",
1686,"INCLUSION AND TRACE ELEMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF EMERALDS FROM SWAT VALLEY, PAKISTAN Swat Valley has become an important source of emeralds, including recently discovered trapiche-type crystals. In this study, emerald samples from Swat were examined by standard gemological testing, UV-Vis-NIR, FTIR, Raman analysis, EDXRF, and LA-ICP-MS. The study found three-phase hexagonal inclusions consisting of water, gaseous carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and a magnesite crystal. The gaseous mixture in two-phase inclusions is characteristic in both trapiche-type (CO2 + N-2) and non-trapiche samples (CO2 + N-2 + CH4). Mineral inclusions of hematite, magnetite, rutile, graphite, and siderite are reported for the first time. Regular non-trapiche-type Swat emeralds contain high chromium (avg. 7471 ppmw), alkali metal (avg. 21040 ppmw), magnesium (avg. 34263 ppmw), and iron (avg. 9265 ppmw), as well as scandium (avg. 633 ppmw). Infrared spectra show that the absorption of type II H2O is stronger than that of type I H2O. Logarithm plots of trace elements appear to be diagnostic. Based on Raman spectroscopy, the trapiche-type emeralds' colorless core, light green hexagonal growth zone area, and green rim are emerald, while the six black arms are a mixture of hematite and graphite.",
1687,"Impact factor analysis of aquatic species diversity in the Huai River Basin, China Water pollution has been a significant issue in the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China since the late 1970s. From December 2012, five experiments were carried out along the main streams of the HRB. The monitoring indices contained physicochemical variables, habitat environmental indicators and the community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos. The correlations between species diversity and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis, correlation analysis method and redundancy analysis method. Results indicated that the species diversities of the Shaying River's upstream and Huai River's mainstream were better than the Shaying River's midstream and downstream. All the sections were divided into five clusters, and different clusters were affected by different physicochemical factors. Dissolved oxygen (DO), habitat quality index (HQI) and chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) were the main factors affecting the species diversity of the Shaying River's upstream; total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), CODCr and permanganate index (CODMn) had a great influence on the Shaying River's midstream and downstream; DO, water temperature (WT), HQI and COD(Cr)were the main factors affecting the Huai River's mainstream. These results provide valuable information for policy decision makers and stakeholders on water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable watershed management in the HRB.",
1688,"Geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids from the PACMANUS, Northeast Pual and Vienna Woods hydrothermal fields, Manus Basin, Papua New Guinea Processes controlling the composition of seafloor hydrothermal fluids in silicic back-arc or near-arc crustal settings remain poorly constrained despite growing evidence for extensive magmatic hydrothermal activity in such environments. We conducted a survey of vent fluid compositions from two contrasting sites in the Manus back-arc basin, Papua New Guinea, to examine the influence of variations in host rock composition and magmatic inputs (both a function of arc proximity) on hydrothermal fluid chemistry. Fluid samples were collected from felsic-hosted hydrothermal vent fields located on Pual Ridge (PACMANUS and Northeast (NE) Pual) near the active New Britain Arc and a basalt-hosted vent field (Vienna Woods) located farther from the arc on the Manus Spreading Center. Vienna Woods fluids were characterized by relatively uniform endmember temperatures (273-285 degrees C) and major element compositions, low dissolved CO2 concentrations (4.4 mmol/kg) and high measured pH (4.2-4.9 at 25 degrees C). Temperatures and compositions were highly variable at PACM-ANUS/NE Pual and a large, newly discovered vent area (Fenway) was observed to be vigorously venting boiling (358 degrees C) fluid. All PACMANUS fluids are characterized by negative delta D-H2O values, in contrast to positive values at Vienna Woods, suggesting substantial magmatic water input to circulating fluids at Pual Ridge. Low measured pH (25 degrees C) values (similar to 2.6-2.7), high endmember CO2 (up to 274 mmol/kg) and negative delta S-34(H2S) values (down to -2.7 parts per thousand) in some vent fluids are also consistent with degassing of acid-volatile species from evolved magma. Dissolved CO2 at PACMANUS is more enriched in C-13 (-4.1 parts per thousand to -2.3 parts per thousand) than Vienna Woods (-5.2 parts per thousand to -5.7 parts per thousand), suggesting a contribution of slab-derived carbon. The mobile elements (e.g. Li, K, Rb, Cs and B) are also greatly enriched in PACMANUS fluids reflecting increased abundances in the crust there relative to the Manus Spreading Center. Variations in alkali and dissolved gas abundances with Cl at PACMANUS and NE Pual suggest that phase separation has affected fluid chemistry despite the low temperatures of many vents. In further contrast to Vienna Woods, substantial modification of PACMANUS/NE Pual fluids has taken place as a result of seawater ingress into the upflow zone. Consistently high measured Mg concentrations as well as trends of increasingly non-conservative SO4 behavior, decreasing endmember Ca/Cl and Sr/Cl ratios with increased Mg indicate extensive subsurface anhydrite deposition is occurring as a result of subsurface seawater entrainment. Decreased pH and endmember Fe/Mn ratios in higher Mg fluids indicate that the associated mixing/cooling gives rise to sulfide deposition and secondary acidity production. Several low temperature (<= 80 degrees C) fluids at PACMANUS/NE Pual also show evidence for anhydrite dissolution and water rock interaction (fixation of B) subsequent to seawater entrainment. Hence, the evolution of fluid compositions at Pual Ridge reflects the cumulative effects of water/rock interaction, admixing and reaction of fluids exsolved from silicic magma, phase separation/segregation and seawater ingress into upflow zones.

1689,"A comparative profitability study of geothermal electricity production in developed and developing countries: Exergoeconomic analysis and optimization of different ORC configurations By the growing usage of geothermal energy as an alternative approach to produce useful work such as electricity, the emission of global greenhouse gases could be reduced because of its environmentally friendly. In this paper, the thermodynamic and economic performances of three systems which contain a basic Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), a Regenerative Organic Rankine Cycle (RORC) and a Two-Stage Evaporation Organic Rankine Cycle (TSEORC) are investigated in order to generate electrical power from geothermal sources. For operating the considered cycles, three types of pure organic working fluids including dry (R600a, R601a), wet (R152a and R134a) and isentropic (R11 and R123) ones are selected. Firstly, according to thermodynamic aspect, Peng Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations of state are used to determine thermodynamic properties of mentioned working fluids and geothermal water, respectively. Furthermore, the operating parameters involving evaporator and regenerative temperatures, degree of superheat and pinch point temperature difference in evaporator are optimized with three optimization methods. Objective functions are exergy efficiency, Specific Investment Cost (SIC) and a combination of exergy and SIC for thermodynamic, economic and exergoeconomic optimizations. The amount of boundary conditions constituting of heat source inlet temperature, heat sink inlet temperature, heat source inlet pressure, heat sink inlet pressure temperature of condenser, pinch point temperature in condenser and heat source mass flow rate are 423.14 (K), 293.15 (K), 5 (bar), 2 (bar), 308 (K), 5 (K) and 50 (kg/s) respectively. Optimizations results show that among all considered operating parameters, degree of superheat ranged between 0 and 20 is the most effective parameter which is almost obtained at lower, upper and in the middle range of optimization bounds in the thermodynamic, economic and exergoeconomic investigations respectively. Secondly, from economic view point, three economic indicators: Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE), Return On Investment (ROI) and Payback Period (PBP) are utilized so as to focus on the economic performance of three mentioned ORC configurations based on exergoeconomic results for twenty countries with geothermal resources as well as different cost of electricity production and tax rates. The results indicate that Australia has the maximum amount of ROI making up a bit more than 100% and minimum amount of PBP accounting for lower than four years when R123 is applied as the working fluid in TSEORC system. Also, the maximum and minimum values of LCOE are obtained in basic ORC-R134a and RORC-R123 (0.1474 and 0.0493 respectively). In addition, the investigation of impact of operating parameters on economic indicators for Iran illustrate that the ROI value dramatically rise by increasing the evaporator temperature and degree of superheat. In contrast, pinch point temperature difference leads to a decline in the amount of ROI. This note should be taken in to account that ROI and PBP show the reverse results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1690,"GSM Based Low-cost Gas Leakage, Explosion and Fire Alert System with Advanced Security Gas leakage and gas cylinder explosion is a regular problem in today's world, especially in developing countries. If the gas leakage can't be detected fast and no action is taken, may lead to explosion and cause severe damages to life and environment. The previous leakage detection systems only use alarms for warning. There is nothing about the protection. In this paper, a system is proposed that can detect not only gas leakage, it can detect explosion, and fire as well. And can take some protective steps. It is equipped with gas sensor to detect the leaked gas and flame sensor to detect the explosion and fire. It has exhaust fan system to clear the leaked gas and solenoid valve to inlet the water or carbon dioxide gas (CO2) if explosion and fire occurs. The explosion security system response individually when there is only a fire with no relation to gas leakage. If any incident occurs, that information is sent to owner through wireless media, a display shows the alert message and buzzer makes the alarm. It is equipped with Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) modem as wireless media to send information to owner through Short Message Service (SMS). This ensures preventive actions immediately even in the absence of people on-site. A prototype of this system has been developed and tested with Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Fire as well. The experimental results show that the system can detect the gas leakage, explosion and fire. It is also able to take protective steps quickly. This life saving system is low-cost and useful. It can protect people from burning alive. Â© 2019 IEEE.",
1691,"Evaluation of Precipitation Datasets from TRMM Satellite and Down-scaled Reanalysis Products with Bias-correction in Middle Qilian Mountain, China Accurate estimates of precipitation are fundamental for hydrometeorological and ecohydrological studies, but are more difficult in high mountainous areas because of the high elevation and complex terrain. This study compares and evaluates two kinds of precipitation datasets, the reanalysis product downscaled by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) output, and the satellite product, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product, as well as their bias-corrected datasets in the Middle Qilian Mountain in Northwest China. Results show that the WRF output with finer resolution performs well in both estimating precipitation and hydrological simulation, while the TMPA product is unreliable in high mountainous areas. Moreover, bias-corrected WRF output also performs better than bias-corrected TMPA product. Combined with the previous studies, atmospheric reanalysis datasets are more suitable than the satellite products in high mountainous areas. Climate is more important than altitude for the 'falseAlarms' events of the TRMM product. Designed to focus on the tropical areas, the TMPA product mistakes certain meteorological situations for precipitation in subhumid and semiarid areas, thus causing significant 'falseAlarms' events and leading to significant overestimations and unreliable performance. Simple linear bias correction method, only removing systematical errors, can significantly improves the accuracy of both the WRF output and the TMPA product in arid high mountainous areas with data scarcity. Evaluated by hydrological simulations, the bias-corrected WRF output is more reliable than the gauge dataset. Thus, data merging of the WRF output and gauge observations would provide more reliable precipitation estimations in arid high mountainous areas.",
1692,"Creating a Sustainable Humanitarian Engineering Program At Baylor University we have done engineering service projects in the developing world for about 10 years. As we have assessed both our successes and failures, we realized that to make the projects sustainable, they had to be done with local partners over many years. Our level of engagement with the local people has had a significant impact upon the sustainability of the projects. Our model for how best to do this engagement has changed as we have learned from experience. We are now working in Haiti, partnering with a local non-profit group that has been working in Haiti for 20 years. This helped us earn credibility in the local community. In May 2013 and May 2014 we did solar projects that were well received. We also did projects involving water quality testing and water purification. This work has great promise for being sustainable, for it is working with (not for) the local people and is close enough to the United States so that its costs are more manageable. In addition to creating sustainable projects, we need to develop ways to make the program at our university sustainable. This involves doing several things to help students stay motivated to work in this area. In addition to our trips we have created several co curricular activities (such as a book club discussing Humanitarian Engineering). We have also made curricular changes, such as introducing an alternative engineering ethics course called Ethics for International Service. We have created a Humanitarian Engineering concentration within our generic engineering major. Students in this concentration will take courses in six topics: people (and culture), economics, development, energy, food/water, and an international service learning class. When coupled with their engineering skills, these courses will help our students be more successful while working in the developing world.",
1693,"Urinary arsenic metabolites in children and adults exposed to arsenic in drinking water in Inner Mongolia, China BACKGROUND: We report the concentrations and distributions of urinary arsenic (As) metabolites in 233 residents exposed to 20, 90, or 160 microg/L inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water from three villages in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China, that formed one control and two exposed groups. METHODS: We used hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS) to determine iAs, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). RESULTS: The concentrations of each urinary As species in the two exposed groups were significantly higher than in the control group for both children and adults. Both children and adults in exposed groups had higher percent iAs and MMA and lower percent DMA, and low primary and secondary methylation indices (PMI and SMI, respectively) than those in the control group. However, children showed significant increases in percent DMA and the SMI as well as decreases in the percent MMA when the iAs exposure level increased from 90 to 160 microg/L. In addition, children in the two exposed groups showed lower percent MMA but higher percent DMA and higher SMI than adults in the same exposed group. No significant differences in As metabolite concentrations and distributions were found between males and females in each group. A significant correlation was also found in the SMI between 11 pairs of children and their mothers from the 160-microg/L-exposed group. CONCLUSIONS: Children had higher a capacity for secondary methylation of As than adults when exposed to the same concentrations of iAs in drinking water. Exposure to As may increase the capacity for methylation in children to some extent.",
1694,"Induction of genotoxic damage is not correlated with the ability to methylate arsenite in vitro in the leukocytes of four mammalian species Arsenic is a natural drinking water contaminant that impacts the health of large populations of people throughout the world; however, the mode or mechanism by which arsenic induces cancer is unclear. In a series of in vitro studies, we exposed leukocytes from humans, mice, rats, and guinea pigs to a range of sodium arsenite concentrations to determine whether the lymphocytes from these species showed differential sensitivity to the induction of micronuclei (MN) assessed in cytochalasin B-induced binucleate cells. We also determined the capacity of the leukocytes to methylate arsenic by measuring the production of MMA [monomethylarsinic acid (MMA(V)) and monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III))] and DMA [dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) and dimethylarsonous acid (DMA(III))]. The results indicate that cells treated for 2 hr at the G(0) stage of the cell cycle with sodium arsenite showed only very small to negligible increases in MN after mitogenic stimulation. Treatment of actively cycling cells produced induction of MN with increasing arsenite concentration, with the human, rat, and mouse lymphocytes being much more sensitive to MN induction than those of the guinea pig. These data gave an excellent fit to a linear model. The leukocytes of all four species, including the guinea pig (a species previously thought not to methylate arsenic), were able to methylate arsenic, but there was no clear correlation between the ability to methylate arsenic and the induction of MN.",

1696,"Inference of Convergent Gene Acquisition Among Pseudomonas syringae Strains Isolated From Watermelon, Cantaloupe, and Squash Pseudomonas syringae sensu strict , (phylogroup 2; referred to as P. syringae) consists of an environmentally ubiquitous bacterial population associated with diseases of numerous plant species. Recent studies using multilocus sequence analysis have indicated the clonal expansion of several P. syringae lineages, located in phylogroups 2a and 2b, in association with outbreaks of bacterial spot disease of watermelon, cantaloupe, and squash in the United States. To investigate the evolutionary processes that led to the emergence of these epidemic lineages, we sequenced the genomes of six P. syringae strains that were isolated from cucurbits grown in the United States, Europe, and China over a period of more than a decade, as well as eight strains that were isolated from watermelon and squash grown in six different Florida counties during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. These data were subjected to comparative analyses along with 42 previously sequenced genomes of P. syringae stains collected from diverse plant species and environments available from GenBank. Maximum likelihood reconstruction of the P. syringae core genome revealed the presence of a hybrid phylogenetic group, comprised of cucurbit strains collected in Florida, Italy, Serbia, and France, which emerged through genome-wide homologous recombination between phylogroups 2a and 2b. Functional analysis of the recombinant core genome showed that pathways involved in the ATP-dependent transport and metabolism of amino acids, bacterial motility, and secretion systems were enriched for recombination. A survey of described virulence factors indicated the convergent acquisition of several accessory type 3 secreted effectors (T3SEs) among phylogenetically distinct lineages through integrative and conjugative element and plasmid loci. Finally, pathogenicity assays on watermelon and squash showed qualitative differences in virulence between strains of the same clonal lineage, which correlated with T3SEs acquired through various mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This study provides novel insights into the interplay of homologous recombination and HGT toward pathogen emergence and highlights the dynamic nature of P. syringae sensu lato genomes.",
1697,"Pre-drill pore pressure prediction using seismic velocities for prospect areas at Beni Suef Oil Field, Western Desert, Egypt Pre-drill prediction of formation pore pressure from surface seismic survey is very important for drilling, production, and reservoir engineering because it affects drilling operations and well-planning processes. If it is not properly evaluated, it can lead to numerous drilling problems such as dangerous well kicks, lost circulation, blowouts, stuck pipe, excessive costs, and borehole instability. Pre-drill pore pressure estimation has been obtained from transform models using seismic interval velocities. However, the accuracy of this estimate of pore pressure is directly related to the reliability of these interval velocities. Bulk density was estimated from seismic interval velocity and transit time. Normal pore pressure gradient is estimated from the slope of a trendline that is generated from logarithm transit times versus depth. Overburden pressure at any depth was calculated from the integration of the average interval bulk densities and thicknesses above that depth. Pore pressure has been obtained from overburden pressure and observed interval velocities using modified Eaton's equation. 154 CDPs were used along 28 seismic lines at Beni Suef basin, Western Desert, Egypt, to accomplish the purpose of this study. Two velocity reversal zones showing abnormally high pore pressure were detected and correlated to Abu Roash and Bahariya Formations. Moreover, pore pressure gradient maps were established for these two zones to predict the possible horizontal fluid flow (migration paths) for the proposal of prospects with lower pressures and less drilling risks. Finally, it is possible to calculate and recommend the required heavier mud weight to drill.",
1698,"Radon exposure assessment and its decay products aerosols in some houses of the province of El Jadida, Morocco In this study, indoor and outdoor activities of radon and its progeny were measured using the passive dosimetry CR-39 detectors inside and outside of 60 houses of El Jadida province, Morocco. Thereafter, three radiological parameters namely the potential alpha energy concentrations (PAEC), the annual effective dose (E), and the lung cancer cases per year per million person (CPPP) were calculated. The obtained results showed that the nature of construction materials, the presence of wells inside houses and the proximity of the industrial zone of Jorf Lasfar have a significant impact on indoor radon concentrations and its decay products. In fact, the registered activities go from 52 Bq m(-3)in modern houses whose age is less than 20 years to 266 Bq m(-3)in old houses of more than 50 years located near the industrial zone of Jorf Lasfar. The average values of the potential alpha energy concentrations, the annual effective doses, and the lung cancer risks per year per million person measured in the different houses vary respectively from 9.1 mWL, 1.50 mSv y(-1), 27 in modern houses to 48 mWL, 7.82 mSv y(-1), 141 in old houses of more than 50 years located near the industrial zone of Jorf Lasfar, values which remain close to the admissible safety limits (53.33 mWL, 10 mSv y(-1), 230). Due to this, it would be interesting and desirable to prohibit houses near industrial areas and borehole wells inside houses with a choice of construction materials adapted to the criteria of the limitation of doses.",

In the past several decades, Fe3O4 magnetite has played an important role in wastewater treatment. There are growing appeals for surface-modified Fe3O4 magnetite due to high affinity of modified nanoparticles (NPs) toward contaminants. In this study, a chemical coprecipitation method was applied to synthesize the Fe3O4 NPs. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Fe3O4 NPs (uncoated or free) revealed the agglomeration of the magnetite (Fe3O4) particles. But the horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) and activated carbon-coated (ACC) Fe3O4 oxide exhibited homogeneous distribution of particles with relatively less agglomerate of the particles. In this work, the adsorption potential of free-Fe3O4, HRP-Fe3O4, and ACC-Fe3O4 were explored for removal of acid violet 17 (AV 17), rhodamine B (RhB), Congo red (CR), and methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The present work highlights the synthesis techniques, modification, and characterization of prepared NPs using SEM, x-ray defractometry (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). In addition, this study covers adsorption equilibrium isotherms, kinetics, thermodynamics, and future applications. At optimum operating conditions, 60% AV 17, 78% RhB, 85% CR, and 90.62% MB removed using free-Fe3O4. Similarly, in the case of HRP-Fe3O4, 90% AV 17, 92% RhB, 98% MB, and 99% CR removed successfully. While in the case of ACC-Fe3O4, 93% AV 17 and >98% RhB, MB, and CR dyes were removed. The Langmuir adsorption capacity obtained in the present study is 19.6, 35.2, and 37 mg/L for AV 17; 31, 42, and 47 mg/g for RhB; 45.4, 50, and 52 mg/g for CR; and 35.4, 47.1, and 49.2 for MB, obtained using free-Fe3O4, HRP-Fe3O4, and ACC-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, respectively. The obtained results suggest that the data are in fit with the Langmuir model for all the dyes. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies signifying that the present adsorption process is feasible with spontaneous as well as endothermic. The prepared green magnetite nanoparticles could be use in different application due to their magnetic property. (c) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",
1700,"Possible involvement of ethnicity and clan consanguinity in the modulation of arseniasis risk in a multiethnic, hyperendemic village exposed to indoor combustion of high arsenic-content coal Inorganic arsenic compounds are listed by IARC as an evident human carcinogen (Group 1) (IARC 1987). Most of the environmental arsenic poisoning (other than occupational exposure) cases reported so far were associated with the daily exposure via drinking water naturally contaminated from arsenic-rich geological formations. Arseniasis due to drinking water naturally contaminated from arsenic-rich geological formations is a serious problem for about 2,343,000 rural residents living in 583 villages, 40 counties, in 7 different provinces and regions in Chinese mainland (Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, Anhui) (Jin et al. 2003) and some other countries (Bangladesh, India, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Thailand, etc.) as well (WHO 2001; Chen et al. 2005; Ferreccio et al. 2000; Hopenhayn-Rich et al. 1996a,1996b,1998; Tondel et al. 1999).

1701,"USAGE OF DRAINAGE WATER IN IRRIGATION : APPLICATIONS ON THE EASTERN EUPHRATES IN BABYLON PROVINCE Climate changes had caused a decline in the amount of rain falling on the Tigris and Euphrates basins, as well as the acceleration of their river heads countries in the establishment of control and storage projects, which led to a serious shortage of water supplies of the two rivers actually reached Iraq. As part of the solution, the study aims to analyze the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the Euphrates Drainage, which extends between Middle Euphrates Providences, to determine the possibility of using them in agriculture in areas where the drainage passes to alleviate the problem of water shortage. It was found from the laboratory analysis of the water and its quantities that the quantities were sufficient to invest economically, and the quality was medium salinity in summer, and can be modified salinity by the addition of fresh water or magnetized or both and then the cultivation of crops that are sensitive to salinity. It is proposed to establish an axis of sustainable development with the extension of the drainage in the provinces of Babil, Najaf and Qadissiya and cultivate more than (100) thousand acres, and collect the scatter settlement in modern agricultural villages based on by west water resources.",
1702,"alpha-Bi2O3/beta-Ni(OH)(2) composites: Effective solar light photocatalysts for organic pollutants degradation alpha-Bi2O3/beta-Ni(OH)(2) composites exhibited perfect photocatalytic properties for organic pollutants degradation under sunlight irradiation. Pure alpha-Bi2O3 and beta-Ni(OH)(2) were prepared by coprecipitation method and then mechanically mixed in different proportions to form alpha-Bi2O3/beta-Ni(OH)(2) composites. The XRD and FTIR analyses have well emphasized the formation of monoclinic alpha-Bi2O3 and hexagonal beta-Ni(OH)(2) phases with high crystallinity. The SEM micrographs of alpha-Bi2O3 and beta-Ni(OH)(2) powders displayed a rod and sheet shaped grains, respectively. The band gap of the pure alpha-Bi2O3 was estimated to be 2.87 eV. Pure beta-Ni(OH)(2) revealed three absorption bands in the UV-visible light region. alpha-Bi2O3/5-Ni(OH)(2) composites have a more intense absorption in the visible light region compared to pure alpha-Bi2O3 sample. Modification of alpha-Bi(2)O(3 )by beta-Ni(OH)(2) induced a superior photocatalytic activity especially at beta-Ni(OH)(2) content of 12 wt% in alpha-Bi2O3 (BN-12 composite). This composite showed high efficiencies of 99%, 96%, 91% and 90% for methylene blue, Congo red, methyl orange and 4-niropheniol degradation in 80, 80, 180 and 300 min under sunlight irradiation, respectively. The remarkable photocatalytic activity of the alpha-Bi2O3/beta-Ni(OH)(2) composite was attributed to the new states in charge separation, charge transportation and the intensive absorption of visible light alpha-Bi2O3/beta-Ni(OH)(2) composite (BN-12) has a great potential in removing of cationic and anionic dyes beside phenolic compounds from wastewater.",
1703,"Water budget on the Dudh Koshi River (Nepal): Uncertainties on precipitation Although vital for millions of inhabitants, Himalayan water resources remain currently poorly known, mainly because of uncertainties on hydro-meteorological measurements. In this study, the authors propose a new assessment of the water budget components of the Dudh Koshi River basin (3720 km(2), Eastern Nepal), taking into account the associated uncertainties. The water budget is studied through a cross analysis of field observations with the result of a daily hydrological conceptual distributed snow model. Both observed datasets of spatialized precipitations, interpolated with a co-kriging method, and of discharge, provided by the hydrological agency of Nepal, are completed by reanalysis data (NCEP/NCAR) for air temperature and potential evapotranspiration, as well as satellite snow products (MOD10A2) giving the dynamics of the snow cover area. According to the observation, the water budget on the basin is significantly unbalanced; it is attributed to a large underestimation of precipitation, typical of high mountain areas. By contrast, the water budget simulated by the modeling approach is well balanced; it is due to an unrealistic overestimation of the glacier melt volume. A reversing method led to assess the precipitation underestimation at around 80% of the annual amount. After the correction of the daily precipitation by this ratio, the simulated fluxes of rainfall, icemelt, and snowmelt gave 63%, 29%, and 8% of the annual discharge, respectively. This basin-wide precipitation correction is likely to change in respect to topographic or geographic parameters, or in respect to seasons, but due to an insufficient knowledge of the precipitation spatial variability, this could not be investigated here, although this may significantly change the respective proportions for rain, ice or snow melt. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1704,"Combining Water Quality Indices and Multivariate Modeling to Assess Surface Water Quality in the Northern Nile Delta, Egypt Assessing surface water quality for drinking use in developing countries is important since water quality is a fundamental aspect of surface water management. This study aims to improve surface water quality assessments and their controlling mechanisms using the drinking water quality index (DWQI) and four pollution indices (PIs), which are supported by multivariate statistical analyses, such as principal component analysis, partial least squares regression (PLSR), and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR). Twenty-two physicochemical parameters were analyzed using standard analytical methods for 55 surface water sites in the northern Nile Delta, Egypt. TheDWQIresults indicated that 33% of the tested samples represented good water, and 67% of samples indicated poor to unsuitable water for drinking use. ThePIresults revealed that surface water samples were strongly affected by Pb and Mn and were slightly affected by Fe and Cr. The SMLR models of theDWQIandPIs, which were based on all major ions and heavy metals, provided the best estimations withR(2)= 1 for theDWQIandPIs. In conclusion, integration between theDWQIandPIs is a valuable and applicable approach for the assessment of surface water quality, and the PLSR and SMLR models can be used through applications of chemometric techniques to evaluate theDWQIandPIs.",
1705,"Enrichment Process and Efficient Removal of Thallium from Steel Plant Desulfurization Wastewater Thallium (Tl) is a typical trace metal of extreme high toxicity. As a concomitant element, Tl is widely found in various sulfide minerals and K-containing rock minerals. The outburst of Tl pollution in drinking water sources of the northern branch of the Pearl River in China as reported in 2010 has greatly aroused public concerns about Tl pollution in China. Apart from typical sources of Tl pollution such as Pb and Zn smelting and the mining and utilization of Tl-containing pyrite ores, the steel-making industry was discovered a new significant source that contributed to this Tl pollution incidence. Thallium contents in raw materials, fly ash and wastewater collected from a typical steel-making enterprise were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that Tl contents (0.02-1.03 mg/kg) are generally low in the raw materials, while fly ash samples have generally enriched Tl levels (1.31-6.45 mg/kg). Wastewater obtained from the dedusting process of the sintering furnace also exhibited excessive Tl levels (574-2130 mu g/L). All these results suggested a possible release and gasification of Tl compounds from the raw materials under high temperatures (>800 degrees C) during the sintering processes, which were then accumulated in the flue gas and fly ash and washed into the wastewater by wet dedusting. Lime precipitation method is not effective for removing Tl from wastewater, since Tl mostly is present as dissolved Tl+ in the water. The study initiated a preliminary design of a fast and effective treatment method for Tl removal from Tl-containing industrial wastewater by using a deep oxidation system.",
1706,"The drivers and impacts of water infrastructure reliability â€“ a global analysis of manufacturing firms Inadequate infrastructure impedes the productivity of manufacturing firms, with negative consequences for the wider economy. This study examines how water infrastructure copes with severe weather fluctuations and analyzes the effect of unreliable water supplies on the productivity of manufacturing firms, focusing predominately on firms in developing economies. This is achieved using firm-level data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys covering over 16,000 manufacturing firms in a cross-section of 103 countries. The study finds that periods of significantly low rainfall lead to higher water outages. The overall impact is driven by the effects of drought on less-developed economies, with economies at higher levels of income benefitting from more resilient water infrastructure. Furthermore, we find that incidents of water outages lead to lower firm productivity for firms in less-developed economies. For the average firm located in a low or lower-middle income economy, one additional water outage incident per day in a typical month can lead to losses of approximately 8.2% of annual sales. This calls for increased policy focus on water infrastructure services, particularly in poorer countries where water infrastructure and firms seem to be particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of rainfall.

1707,"A case study of an enhanced eutrophication model with stoichiometric zooplankton growth sub-model calibrated by Bayesian method Urban lakes in China have suffered from severe eutrophication over the past several years, particularly those with relatively small areas and closed watersheds. Many efforts have been made to improve the understanding of eutrophication physiology with advanced mathematical models. However, several eutrophication models ignore zooplankton behavior and treat zooplankton as particles, which lead to the systematic errors. In this study, an eutrophication model was enhanced with a stoichiometric zooplankton growth sub-model that simulated the zooplankton predation process and the interplay among nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen cycles. A case study in which the Bayesian method was used to calibrate the enhanced eutrophication model parameters and to calculate the model simulation results was carried out in an urban lake in Tianjin, China. Finally, a water quality assessment was also conducted for eutrophication management. Our result suggests that (1) integration of the Bayesian method and the enhanced eutrophication model with a zooplankton feeding behavior sub-model can effectively depict the change in water quality and (2) the nutrients resulting from rainwater runoff laid the foundation for phytoplankton bloom.",
1708,"Abundance and diversity of methanogens: potential role in high arsenic groundwater in Hetao Plain of Inner Mongolia, China To investigate the community diversity and abundance of methanogens and their potential role in high arsenic groundwater, 17 groundwater samples from Hetao Plain of Inner Mongolia were investigated with an integrated method including 16S rRNA gene clone library, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and geochemistry analyses. Total arsenic (AsTot) concentrations were 82.7-1088.7 Î¼g/L and arsenite (AsIII) mostly dominated in these samples with percentages of 0.04-0.79. CHâ‚„ concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 292 Î¼g/L and distinctly elevated only when AsTot were relatively high and SOâ‚„(2-) were distinctly low. Principal component analysis indicated that these samples were divided into three groups according to the variations of AsTot, CHâ‚„ and SOâ‚„(2-). AsTot concentrations were distinctly high in the group with high CHâ‚„ and low SOâ‚„(2-) comparing to the other two groups (one with high CHâ‚„ and high SOâ‚„(2-), the other with low CHâ‚„ and SOâ‚„(2-)). The mcrA gene (methyl coenzyme-M reductase gene) based phylogenetic analysis of methanogens population showed that methanogenic archaea was diverse but mainly composed of Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales, Methanobacteria and unidentified groups, with Methanomicrobiales being distinctly dominant (50.6%). The mcrA gene abundance in high arsenic groundwater ranged from 3.01 Ã— 10(3) to 3.80 Ã— 10(6)copies/L and accounted for 0-30.2% of total archaeal 16S rRNA genes. The abundance of mcrA genes was positively correlated with the concentrations of AsTot (R=0.59), AsIII (R=0.57) and FeII (R=0.79), while it was negatively correlated with oxidation-reduction potential (R=-0.66) and SOâ‚„(2-) concentration (R=-0.64). These results implied that methanogenic archaea might accelerate As release in groundwater aquifers in Hetao Plain.",

1710,"Environmental analytical research in Northern Vietnam - A Swiss-Vietnamese cooperation focusing on arsenic and organic contaminants in aquatic environments and drinking water A long-term education and research partnership has been established between the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) and two university institutes in Hanoi. Here we give a summary report on environmental analytical investigations conducted in cooperation with the Hanoi University of Science focusing on (i) arsenic contamination in ground and drinking water, (ii) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including disinfection by-products and chlorination practice in drinking water, (iii) analysis and occurrence of organophosphorus pesticides in rice growing areas, and (iv) chlorinated phenols and other chlorinated pollutants in wastewater of a pulp and paper mill. Arsenic concentrations ranged from 1 to 3050 mug/l (average 159 mug/l) in groundwater from the city of Hanoi and surrounding rural areas. The high arsenic levels indicate that several million people consuming untreated groundwater might be at a considerable risk of chronic arsenic poisoning. Water produced by the Hanoi waterworks is partly affected by arsenic, but VOCs and disinfection by-products were below international guideline limits. However, the current chlorination practice was found to be critical regarding water quality issues. Chlorinated pollutants were particularly abundant in wastewater effluents of pulp bleaching, suggesting that point-of-source treatment options should be implemented. The high pesticide concentrations measured in rice fields (>500 mug/l) were rapidly flushed into ambient surface waters, where beneficial organisms could be affected.",
1711,"Environmental controls of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in Chinese inland waters Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) are expanding world-wide, adversely affecting aquatic food production, recreational and tourism activities and safe drinking water supplies. China's inland waters have been increasingly threatened by CyanoHABs during the past several decades. The environmental factors controlling CyanoHABs are highly variable in space and time in China due to significant variations in climate, geography, geological and geochemical conditions among its many regions. Here, we synthesize diverse examples among Chinese water bodies regarding interactive effects of anthropogenic, climatic and geographic drivers influencing CyanoHAB potentials and dynamics in lakes and reservoirs; in order to provide a perspective and integrative approach to mitigating CyanoHABs. In China's many shallow water bodies, water quality is highly susceptible to human activity and to changing climatic and hydrological conditions, when compared to deeper lakes. Rapid increases in population, economic activity, and wastewater have accelerated CyanoHABs in China since 1980s, especially in the heavily urbanized, agricultural and industrial regions in the middle and lower Yangtze River basins. Climatic changes have provided an additional catalyst for expansion of CyanoHABs. In particular, rising spring temperatures have accelerated the onset and proliferation of Microcystis spp, blooms in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River basin. Large hydroelectric and water supply projects, like the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), have altered hydrological regimes, and have led to an increase of CyanoHABs in reservoirs and tributaries due to increases in water residence times. Manipulating water level fluctuations in the TGR may prove useful for controlling CyanoHAB in its tributary bays. Overall,CyanoHAB mitigation strategies will have to incorporate both N and P input reductions in these shallow systems. Furthermore, nutrient reduction strategies must consider climate change-induced increases in extreme weather events, including more intense rainfall and protracted heat waves and droughts, which can extend the magnitudes and duration of CyanoHABs. Ensuring the maintenance of natural hydrologic connectivity between lakes and rivers is of utmost importance in mitigating CyanoHABs throughout China.",
1712,"Brittle structures and their role in controlling porosity and permeability in a complex Precambrian crystalline-rock aquifer system in the Colorado Rocky Mountain Front Range Expansion of the Denver metropolitan area has resulted in substantial residential development in the foothills of the Rocky Mountain Front Range. This type of suburban growth, characteristic of much of the semiarid intermountain west, often relies on groundwater from individual domestic wells and is exemplified in the Turkey Creek watershed. The watershed is underlain by complexly deformed and fractured crystalline bedrock in which groundwater resources are poorly understood, and concerns regarding groundwater mining and degradation have arisen. As part of a pilot project to establish quantitative bounds on the groundwater resource, an outcrop-based geologic characterization and numerical modeling study of the brittle structures and their controls on the flow system was initiated. Existing data suggest that groundwater storage, flow, and contaminant transport are primarily controlled by a hetero-geneous array of fracture networks. Inspections of well-permit data and field observations led to a conceptual model in which three dominant lithologic groups underlying sparse surface deposits form the aquifer system-metamorphic rocks, a complex array of granitic intrusive rocks, and major brittle fault zones. Pervasive but variable jointing of each lithologic group forms the ""background"" permeability structure and is an important component of the bulk storage capacity. This ""background"" is cut by brittle fault zones of varying structural styles and by pegmatite dikes, both with much higher fracture intensities relative to ""background"" that likely make them spatially complex conduits. Probabilistic, discrete-fracture-network and finite-element modeling was used to estimate porosity and permeability at the outcrop scale using fracture network data collected in the field. The models were conditioned to limited aquifer test and borehole geophysical data and give insight into the relative hydraulic properties between locations and geologic controls on storage and flow. Results from this study reveal a complex aquifer system in which the upper limits on estimated hydraulic properties suggest limited storage capacity and permeability as compared with many sedimentary-rock and surficial-deposit aquifers.",
1713,"Economic policy uncertainty and energy production in China Owing to economics are usually linked with energy production, economic policy may have an instantaneous adjustment according to the current monetary, financial, cultural circumstances. This research thus investigates the dynamic co-movement as well as cointegration relationships between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and disparate energy productions, i.e., Chinese coal, natural gas, crude oil, electricity as well as renewable energy, during the period from January 1995 to October 2019 in China. We compare the two EPU indices and make empirical and robust analysis to get more evidence for the time-varying co-movement between energy production and EPU. The empirical results show that there are stationary properties and cointegration relationships between energy production and EPU. By utilizing wavelet co-movement analysis in the time-frequency domain, our results show a significant positive co-movement among disparate energy productions and EPU at high frequencies, i.e., in the short term, but weaker co-movement at low frequencies, i.e., in the long term. Hence, the phase-difference series are mostly around the zero line, implying the variables behave to the dynamics of the co-movement with positive causality. Policy recommendations are offered in accordance with our finding.",
1714,"Influence of salt solutions on the permeability, membrane efficiency and wettability of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi shale in Xiushan, Southwest China The transmission of pore pressure is considered as one of the primary factors of wellbore instability in shales. Environmental and economic considerations make water-based drilling fluid (WBDF) as a possible method to retard or even inhibit shale hydration. Before that, the mechanisms of salt solutions on the physical properties of shales should be clarified. The influence of various types (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, HCOONa, and HCOOK) and concentrations (5 wt%, 10 wt%, and 20 wt%) salt solutions on the permeability, membrane efficiency, and wettability of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi shale in Xiushan, Southwest China (Longmaxi shale), was investigated with HKY-3 shale pressure transmission device, and JC2000DM contact angle measuring instrument. Results showed that salt solutions with better capability to retard pore pressure transmission in Longmaxi shale were 20 wt% HCOONa, 5 wt% HCOONa, 20 wt% KCl, 20 wt% HCOOK, and 5 wt% NaCl. Here the speed of pore pressure transmission in shale was judged by the permeability after pressure transmission test (PTT). Among the five types of salt solutions, HCOONa had the best capability to retard pore pressure transmission. 5 wt% NaCl, 10 wt% KC1, and 20 wt% HCOONa or 20 wt% NaCl presented higher membrane efficiency than other salt solutions. Meanwhile, the relationship between membrane efficiency and water activity of NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 solutions were positively correlated while the relationship of HCOONa and HCOOK solutions were negatively correlated. After PIT, the contact angle of Longmaxi shale in contact with salt solutions increased up to 44.3%. Higher contact angle leads to the smaller contact area and then less water invasion into shales, resulting in improved wellbore stability. The order of the contact angles of Longmaxi shale in contact with the same type of salt solutions with various concentrations after PTT was 5 wt% > 10 wt% > 20 wt%. The achievements of this paper can offer a guideline to formulate high-performance WBDF for horizontal drilling in Longmaxi shale.",
1715,"Failure of a Vertical Drainage System Installed to Fight the Rise of Groundwater in El-Oued Valley (SE Algeria): Causes and Proposed Solutions El-Oued Valley suffers from the problem of rising groundwater which affects agricultural and urban areas and degrades all aspects of the socioeconomic life of its inhabitants. This problem, which appeared in the 1980s, is primarily a result of overexploitation of deep groundwater, lack of sanitation network, and discharge of wastewater directly into the unconfined aquifer. To solve this problem, a megaproject was carried out, based on the principle of sewerage, to drain and evacuate excess water after treatment to a discharge site 70 km north of the region. In this project, the blade of groundwater above elevation of 60 m should be drained through wells of a vertical drainage system. However, the expected results have not been achieved in most affected cities, where the groundwater level continues to rise. Herein, we propose a solution to this problem, based on a new explanation of the hydrogeological structure of the unconfined aquifer that drives the rising groundwater to the surface. The main part of this research is based on interpretation of well tests carried out in wells of the vertical drainage system.",
1716,"Geochemical framework for water quality studies in sub-Saharan Africa The scope for using hydrogeochemical techniques in water quality studies in Africa is reviewed as a background to a set of thematic papers. Water quality problems are emerging as a key issue in Africa either: i) in view of the pressures of man-made pollution on finite resources; or ii) the existence of regions with naturally induced geological problems, for example fluoride endemic areas. Such natural problems are the focus of this paper and the following topics were emphasised during a workshop in Sodere, Ethiopia: the need to determine natural baselines as a means of recognizing anthropogenic pollution; the need for high quality samples and field data, but relatively basic analytical data; the use of chloride to assist in recharge estimation and water-balance studies; an understanding of depth stratification of water quality as part of the design of well/borehole drilling programmes; the use of hydrogeochemistry in geothermal studies; the recognition of health and/or acceptabilty problems, especially for F, Fe, Mn, As, I and Al.

1717,"Occurrence of soil water repellency in arid and humid climates Soil water repellency generally tends to increase during dry weather while it decreases or completely vanishes after heavy precipitation or during extended periods with high soil water contents. These observations lead to the hypothesis that soil water repellency is common in dry climates and rare in humid climates. The study objective is to test this hypothesis by examining the occurrence of soil water repellency in an arid and humid climate. The main conclusion of this study is that the effect of climate on soil water repellency is very limited. Field observations in the arid Middle Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico (USA) and the humid Piedras Blancas Watershed in Colombia show that the main impact of climate seems to be in which manner it affects the production of organic matter. An extremely dry climate will result in Low organic matter production rates and, therefore, less potential for the development of soil water repellency. On the other hand, a very humid climate is favorable for organic matter production and, therefore, for the development of water repellency. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
1718,"Characterization and source identification of tetracycline antibiotics in the drinking water sources of the lower Yangtze River The occurrence and spatio-temporal patterns of five tetracyclines (TCs) and six of their degradation products were investigated in twenty-eight drinking water sources along the lower Yangtze River (LYR) over dry, normal and flood seasons. Tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxytetracycline (DXC) were the dominant antibiotics detected with the highest occurrence. The maximum concentrations of TC, OTC and DXC were found in dry season as 11.16, 18.98, and 56.09â€¯ng/L, respectively, because of the low dilution, low degradation, and high consumption in this season. Cluster analysis indicated distinct variations in the TCs' compositional profiles in both space and time. OTC and its metabolites contributed 18.5-59.6% of the TC load in dry season, possibly due to the seasonally increased release of pharmaceutical OTCs from sewage effluents, but they were seldom detected in other seasons. Pollution load index analysis showed that tributaries carrying large amounts of veterinary TCs derived from breeding wastewater and untreated rural sewage contributed larger proportions of the TC load for most drinking water sources than sewage outlets. The contribution ratio of the TC load from tributaries (74.5%) was approximately three times higher than that from sewage discharges (25.5%). The study demonstrated that the control of load from tributaries is the key to mitigating TC pollution of the drinking water sources in the LYR. An effective source tracking method for evaluating the contribution of antibiotic load from multiple diffuse pollution origins and identifying the high-risk contamination sources was established for antibiotic management and control.",
1719,"Evaluation of water quality of Thuthapuzha Sub-basin of Bharathapuzha, Kerala, India Hydrochemical investigation of open well and river water samples of Thuthapuzha Sub-basin of Bharathapuzha, Kerala, was carried out to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the physico-chemical parameters. The suitability of water for drinking and irrigation purposes and the processes controlling the water chemistry were also assessed. The study area experiences a humid tropical climate and heavy rainfall of similar to 3830mm/year. Thirty-five open well and nine river water samples were collected during the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The chemical properties of the river water samples were dominated by alkaline earths and weak acids (CaHCO3 type). Even though majority of the open well samples belonged to CaHCO3 type, few samples belonged to NaCl, mixed CaMgCl and mixed CaNaHCO3 water type. The groundwater and river water chemistry of the region was influenced by the chemistry of the host rock rather than precipitation and evaporation. Except pH and the total iron concentration, all other physico-chemical parameters of the open well samples of the study area were within the acceptable limit of drinking purposes. The physico-chemical parameters of the entire river water samples were within the acceptable limit for drinking purpose. The entire open well and river water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes.",
1720,"Radon in Brazilian underground mines Radon is a chemically inert noble radioactive gas found in several radioactive decay chains. In underground mines, especially those that contain or have contained ores associated with uranium-bearing minerals, workers might be exposed to high levels of radon and its decay products (RDP). This work aims to investigate whether the exposure of workers to radon gas and its progeny has been evaluated in Brazilian non-uranium and non-thorium underground mines. Any such results and control measures undertaken or recommended to maintain concentrations under Brazilian occupational exposure limits (OELs) are documented. The methodology we adopted consists of three main phases. The first was an extensive bibliographical survey of the concentration levels of radon and RDP, as well as the radiation dose estimates, considering measurements made heretofore by various Brazilian researchers and exhibiting original measurement work undertaken by the one of the authors (mine O). In the second phase, the values obtained were compared with OELs. In the third phase, any control measures undertaken in mines with high exposure of workers to radon and its progeny were verified, and the adopted controls were determined. Radon concentration data obtained from 52 campaigns in 40 underground mines were analyzed. The results show that assessment of the exposure of workers to radon and its progeny was undertaken in many mines at least once, and that radon levels in 62.5% of the mines, when visited for the first time, were below the Brazilian OELs. As expected, the main control measure adopted or recommended was improvement of the ventilation system.",

Few countries have established water quality criteria for livestock for chemical contaminants. For those that have them, the values are quite variable among each other for the same substance due to differences in the approach for the acceptable daily intakes and algorithms for the calculation. In several countries, including Brazil, these standards are based on international or other countries' data, which differ among protected species, exposure scenarios, and levels of protection. The objective of this work was to discuss critical issues to establish chemical water quality criteria for livestock in Brazil. A discussion about the difficulties involved and the alternatives when sufficient data are not available is presented. Using the Canadian framework for reference, we provide recommendations on a revised framework and alternatives regarding the use of chronic studies as mandatory, defaulting to human health drinking water quality guidelines/criteria for livestock, the use of additional safety factors, and alternatives in the absence of toxicological data.",
1722,"Eastern China continental lithosphere thinning is a consequence of paleo-Pacific plate subduction: A review and new perspectives Understanding the processes that lead to the lithosphere thinning is a key aspect of continental geology research. In this paper, we present essential observations and summarize our understandings on the lithosphere thinning and accompanying magmatism in eastern continental China since the Mesozoic as a straightforward consequence of plate tectonics. We show that the lithosphere thinning in the Mesozoic resulted from basal hydration weakening with the water coming from dehydration of the paleo-Pacific plate in the mantle transition zone. The weakening effect is to convert the basal lithosphere into asthenosphere by reducing its viscosity, having thus thinned the lithosphere while triggering mantle melting and crustal magmatism marked by the widespread Mesozoic basalts and granitoids in space and time. These observations and logical reasoning require the existence and effect of subducted paleo-Pacific plate in the mantle transition zone, whose active subduction ended at similar to 90 Ma with the suture located off the continental China marked by the arc-shaped southeast coastline. As a result, the thinned lithosphere began a 40-Myr period (i.e., similar to 90 to similar to 50 Ma) of basal accretion manifested by compositional systematics of basalts erupted in this period. The initiation of the present-day western Pacific subduction at similar to 50 Ma and its eastward retreat caused eastward drift of continental China, leaving the older portions of the present-day Pacific slab stagnant in the mantle transition zone with resumed water supply in the form of hydrous melt to maintain the thinned lithosphere, which is the same as creating and maintaining the oceanic-type seismic low velocity zone (LVZ) beneath eastern China, responsible for the Cenozoic alkali basalt volcanism in the region. That is, the present-day lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath eastern China is a petrological boundary, either as an amphibole dehydration solidus or water-saturated solidus. As predicted, the Cenozoic alkali basalts in eastern China demonstrate that lithosphere thickness (i.e., the LAB depth) controls the compositions of mantle melts, i.e., the lid effect. The latter further confirms the LAB beneath eastern China as a solidus, below which decompression melting happens, and above which melt solidifies or ascends rapidly to the surface. Our studies thus lead us to the unavoidable conclusion that the lithosphere thinning in the Mesozoic, the present-day LAB, the seismic LVZ and the widespread Mesozoic-Cenozoic magmatism in eastern China are all consequences of plate tectonics in response to paleo-Pacific plate subduction, which is of global significance for understanding intra-continental magmatism at present and in Earth's histories.",
1723,"High sensitivity arsenic analyzer based on liquid-reagent-free hydride generation and chemiluminescence detection for on-site water analysis In this work, a portable and reliable instrument based on manual hydride generation and subsequent ozone induced chemiluminescence analysis was developed and optimized for measurement of aqueous arsenic in drinking water. The aim was to develop a system for use in the field in villages in developing countries where water treatment systems have been installed. Consequently, it is beneficial that the system could be operated without reagent solutions or purified water. Arsenic trihydride (arsine) was generated by reaction with solid acid and solid borohydride, and then introduced to a chemiluminescence cell where the arsine was mixed with ozone to generate chemiluminescence. The measurement could be repeated with the throughput of 60 times h(-1), and the limit of detection was 0.4 Âµg L(-1). The measurable arsenic concentration was up to 1 mg L(-1) for 2 mL samples. The system was evaluated for analysis of natural water samples, and the obtained data agreed well with those from ICP-MS and sequential hydride generation flow analysis. We expect this small and inexpensive instrument will be used in developing countries.",
1724,"Assessment of the oral health condition of patients admitted to the wards of the Agreste Regional Hospital of Caruaru, PE Hospitalized patients usually neglect oral hygiene, resulting in the accumulation of dental biofilm, which can lead to periodontal and other diseases, aggravating their health condition systemically, and consequently increasing the length of hospital stay. Thus, this study aimed to verify the oral hygiene conditions of patients admitted to the wards of the Agreste Regional Hospital (ARH) of Caruaru, Pernambuco. Data collection took place through the application of a questionnaire and intraoral examinations. In the analysis, the data were entered into an EXCEL spreadsheet and the statistical calculations were obtained using the IMB SPSS program in version 23. 13.86 DMF-T was found, considered very high, and of this total the component ""missing teeth"" showed a higher average. There was also a greater number of decayed teeth in the average DMF-T for those who do not have piped water, 77.4% had dental calculus, and only 3.2% had changes in their mucosa, demonstrating the importance of hospital dentistry, where dental surgeons can act from prevention to treatment.",
1725,"Effects on growth of persimmon (Diospyros virginiana) rootstock of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) is grown in many parts of the world that display subtropical climate conditions, including Turkey. There are 2 common rootstocks used in its production: D. kaki and D. virginiana Thunb. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), a symbiosis between plant roots and members of an ancient phylum of fungi, Glomeromycota, improves root development, water supply, and nutrients such as phosphate and zinc in the host plant. In this study, the effects of 5 AM fungi species (Glomus mosseae, G. clarium, G. etunicatum, G. caledonium, and G. intraradices) on plant growth, chlorophyll concentration, and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv'/Fm') in D. virginiana were investigated under greenhouse conditions. We determined that mycorrhizal inoculations increased shoot and root dry weight compared to the noninoculated plants. Plants inoculated with G. etunicatum showed the highest total plant dry weight. Highest leaf chlorophyll concentration was measured in a plant inoculated with G. caledonium. The results of chlorophyll fluorescence were similar for all AM inoculations; however, they significantly differed from those of noninoculated plants. The results demonstrated the benefit potential of mycorrhizal inoculations for persimmon production.",
1726,"Allocation to leaf area and sapwood area affects water relations of co-occurring savanna and forest trees Water availability is a principal factor limiting the distribution of closed-canopy forest in the seasonal tropics, suggesting that forest tree species may not be well adapted to cope with seasonal drought. We studied 11 congeneric species pairs, each containing one forest and one savanna species, to test the hypothesis that forest trees have a lower capacity to maintain seasonal homeostasis in water relations relative to savanna species. To quantify this, we measured sap flow, leaf water potential (I-L), stomatal conductance (g (s)), wood density, and Huber value (sapwood area:leaf area) of the 22 study species. We found significant differences in the water relations of these two species types. Leaf area specific hydraulic conductance of the soil/root/leaf pathway (G (t)) was greater for savanna species than forest species. The lower G (t) of forest trees resulted in significantly lower I-L and g (s) in the late dry season relative to savanna trees. The differences in G (t) can be explained by differences in biomass allocation of savanna and forest trees. Savanna species had higher Huber values relative to forest species, conferring greater transport capacity on a leaf area basis. Forest trees have a lower capacity to maintain homeostasis in I-L due to greater allocation to leaf area relative to savanna species. Despite significant differences in water relations, relationships between traits such as wood density and minimum I-L were indistinguishable for the two species groups, indicating that forest and savanna share a common axis of water-use strategies involving multiple traits.",
1727,"L-asparaginase and L-glutaminase activities in submerged rice soil amended with municipal solid waste compost and decomposed cow manure The field study was conducted to evaluate the effect of municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) as a soil amendment on L-asparaginase (LA) and L-glutaminase (LG) activities. Experiments were conducted during the wet seasons of 1997, 1998 and 1999 on rice grown under a submerged condition, at the Agriculture Experimental Farm, Calcutta University at Baruipur, West Bengal, India. The treatments consisted of control, no input; MSWC, at 60 Kg N ha(- 1); well-decomposed cow manure (DCM), at 60 Kg N ha(- 1); MSWC (30 Kg N ha(- 1)) + Urea (U) (30 Kg N ha(- 1)); DCM (30 Kg N ha(- 1)) + U (30 Kg N ha(- 1)) and Fertilizer, (at 60:30:30 NPK kg ha(- 1)) through urea, single superphosphate and muriate of potash respectively). LA and LG activities alone and their ratio with organic-C (ratio index value, RIV), straw and grain yield were higher in DCM than MSWC-treated soils, due to higher amount of biogenic organic materials like water-soluble organic carbon, carbohydrate and mineralizable nitrogen in the former. The studied parameters were higher when urea was integrated with DCM or MSWC, compared to their single applications. The heavy metals in MSWC did not detrimentally influence the above-measured activities of soil. In the event of long term MSWC application, changes in soil quality parameters should be monitored regularly, since heavy metals once entering into soil persist over a long period.",
1728,"ISLAND WAKES OBSERVED FROM HIGH-FREQUENCY CURRENT MAPPING RADAR The interaction of large-scale oceanic flows with remote island chains can lead to turbulent wakes, enhanced vorticity production, and significant increases in biological productivity. This study showcases the range of flow conditions captured by surface current mapping high-frequency (HF) radar systems deployed around the main island group of Palau in the western Pacific. The radar array captures strong tidal and inertial flows, both near- and offshore, as well as the spatial and temporal variability associated with the synoptic geostrophic flow interacting with the island group. Surface currents measured by HF radar are significantly correlated to currents in the upper 100 m of the ocean water column, as observed with a concurrent mooring, such that the resulting surface spatial maps provide insight on the wake flows of the island across a significant portion of the upper ocean. Composite averages of eastward and westward incident flow show flow-splitting and reconnection 60 km upstream and downstream of the island group, respectively. Surface current variability observed by the radar array includes topographically blocked flow, flow separation and acceleration through passages in the island chain, eddy dipole structure, and coastal eddies with Rossby numbers of 5. The range of variability near the island chain is reflective of the complex incident flow, which encounters Palau from all directions and changes on timescales of hours to weeks. A high-resolution model qualitatively agrees with the HF radar observations and shows vorticity filaments generated downstream of the island passages.",
1729,"Geology, mineralization, and geochronology of the Qianhe gold deposit, Xiong'ershan area, southern North China Craton The Qianhe gold deposit in the Xiong'ershan area is located along the southern margin of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic North China Craton. The deposit consists of six orebodies that are hosted in Paleoproterozoic andesites to basaltic andesites and structurally controlled by roughly EW-trending faults. Individual orebodies comprise auriferous quartz veins and disseminated Au-bearing pyrite within hydrothermally altered rocks on both sides of, or close to, the veins. Ore-related hydrothermal alteration has produced various mixtures of K-feldspar, quartz, sericite, chlorite, epidote, carbonate, and sulfides. Pyrite is the most important ore mineral, associated with minor amounts of galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. Other trace minerals include molybdenite, arsenopyrite, scheelite, rutile, xenotime, and parisite. Gold occurs mostly as native gold and electrum enclosed in pyrite or along microfractures of sulfides and quartz. Microthermometric measurements of primary inclusions in auriferous quartz suggest that gold and associated minerals were precipitated in the range of 160-305 degrees C from aqueous or carbonic-aqueous fluids with salinities of 6-22 wt% NaCl equiv. Samples of molybdenite coexisting with Au-bearing pyrite have Re-Os model ages of 134-135 Ma, whereas ore-related hydrothermal sericite separates yield Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages between 127 and 124 Ma. The Re-Os and 40Ar/39Ar ages are remarkably consistent with zircon U-Pb ages (134.5 +/- 1.5 and 127.2 +/- 1.4 Ma; 1 sigma) of the biotite monzogranite from the Heyuintrusive complex and granitic dikes in and close to the Qianhe gold mine, indicating a close temporal and thus possibly genetic relationship between gold mineralization and granitic magmatism in the area. Fluid inclusion waters extracted from auriferous quartz have delta D values of -80 to -72 parts per thousand, whereas the calculated delta O-18(H2O) values range from 3.1 to 3.8 parts per thousand. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes from this study and previous work indicate that ore fluids were likely derived from degassing of magmas, with addition of minor amounts of meteoric water. Gold mineralization at Qianhe is temporarily coincident with pervasive bimodal magmatism, widespread fault-basin formation, and well development of metamorphic core complexes in the whole eastern North China Craton that have been interpreted as reflecting reactivation of the craton in the late Mesozoic after prolonged stabilization since its formation in the late Paleoproterozoic. It is therefore concluded that the Qianhe gold deposit formed as a result of this craton reactivation event.",
1730,"Retention of heavy metals from industrial cooling water by filtration through natural percolation filters Slow sand and soil filtration is an ancient waste water method. This purification method remains a preferred process, not only in rural areas, but also in many industrialised countries. It has been shown to be very simple, safe, inexpensive and efficient under many conditions. Compared to other methods, it presents the considerable advantage of making better use of local skills and available materials in developing countries and eliminates bacterial contamination. We have developed, in the laboratory, a percolation infiltration system using vertical columns formed by filter beds made exclusively from agricultural soil, ash, clinker and sea sand. This latter is collected from coastal areas. The main parameters analysed by ICP in this study are Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn. The results obtained by this treatment system show a 40% reduction for Cd, 70% for Cr, 85% for Cu, 95% for Fe, 60% for Pb and 99% for Zn. In order to validate our results, the ICP filtrate analysis was compared to that of drinking water. The purified liquid that we obtained can be used for industrial purposes, for cooling purposes, or for irrigation purposes in agriculture.",
1731,"Simultaneous evaluations of occurrence and probabilistic human health risk associated with trace elements in typical drinking water sources from major river basins in China Water quality is among the most important environmental issues related to sustainable development in China, especially to ensure national drinking water safety. Here, we investigated the concentrations of 19 trace elements in major drinking water sources from five major river basins in China: Yangtze River Basin, Yellow River Basin, Huai River Basin, Hai River Basin, and Liao River Basin. Water quality, human health risk, and probabilistic health risk were evaluated using statistical analysis, as well as the water quality index (WQI), hazard quotient, hazard index (HI), carcinogenic risk (CR), and Monte-Carlo simulation. The distributions of the trace element concentrations differed somewhat among the five river basins. Regardless, the concentrations of all trace metals were within the permissible drinking water quality limits set by China, WHO, and US EPA and Chinese surface water standards (Grade I). Based on the low WQI values, all five river basins were categorized as having ""excellent"" water quality. In the non-carcinogenic risk assessment, the HI values for both adults and children were within the safe limit (<1.0), indicating no adverse health effects on the human body via daily oral intake and dermal absorption. By contrast, the CR values for As exceeded the Chinese limit of 1.0â€¯Ã—â€¯10(-6), with a higher risk for adults, via ingestion as the main exposure pathway. Sensitivity analysis identified exposure duration and ingestion rate as the most sensitive variables affecting the probabilistic risk for adults, while As concentration and exposure duration were the most sensitive variables for children. Overall, the findings indicate that As in drinking water may pose a detrimental health risk to the exposed population; therefore, regulation and management should focus on As monitoring and evaluation in the major river basins of China.",
1732,"Investigations of tungsten mobility in soil using column tests The geochemistry of tungsten has recently gained attention in the scientific and regulatory communities. Tungsten has a complex geochemistry, existing in many environmental matrices as the soluble and mobile tungstate anion, as well as a series of ill-defined polymeric species. Previous work has shown that soluble tungsten leached from a metallic tungsten-spiked Grenada Loring soil will reach an equilibrium concentration >150 mgL(-1), and the concentration is greatly influenced by co-occurring analytes in the matrix, such as calcium and phosphate. In the present work, the mobility of tungsten compounds was investigated in a model soil with a range of aqueous leach solutions using column experiments. The relative column leachate concentrations measured followed trends from previously reported tungstate and polytungstate partition coefficients determined in the model soil under identical aqueous matrix conditions. Neutral to alkaline conditions produced maximum effluent tungsten concentrations >40 mgL(-1), whereas acid leach eluents produced concentrations in the <1-3 mgL(-1) range. The change in leached tungsten speciation over time was also measured as monomeric and polymeric tungsten species have different sorptive behaviors.",
1733,"ACUTE INFANTILE METHEMOGLOBINEMIA. A STATISTICAL APPROACH The presence of nitrites and nitrates in the living body can lead to the appearance of compounds with major toxic effect. Although in the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on November 20 [1], 1989 (published in the Official Monitor no. 109 on November 28, 1990) article 24, paragraph 2 (c) states the obligation of the signatory states to fight diseases, inclusively by assuring an adequate supply of drinking water, acute infantile methemoglobinemia caused by well water still represents a health problem in Romania. For now, cases of acute nitrate poisoning in infants and even deaths are still registered. Nevertheless, several reports focused on the prebiotic potential of the nitrate upon oral health. This paper emphasizes the risks associated with ingestion of substances with a high content of nitrites and nitrates for infants. Information from the Public Health Directorate of Iasi county and reports on literature reports has been analyzed.",
1734,"Evaluation of the efficiency of the photo Fenton disinfection of natural drinking water source during the rainy season in the Sahelian region The photo-disinfection of water from two different wells (W1, pH: 4.6-5.1 Â± 0.02) and (W2 pH: 5.6-5.7 Â± 0.02) was carried out during the rainy season at Ouagadougou-Burkina Faso, West Africa. The weather variation during the rainy season significantly affects the photo-disinfection processes (solar disinfection and photo-Fenton). The dilution of the water by rainwater highly affected the chemical composition of the wells' water used in this study; very low iron contents Compared to the ones recorded during the dry season were recorded in all water samples. Both photo-disinfection processes were used to treat 25 L of water in a compound parabolic collector (CPC). None of them have shown the total inactivation of both wild enteric bacteria strains (total coliforms/E. coli and Salmonella spp.) involved in the treatment. However, the total coliforms/E. coli strains were totally inactivated during the exposure under most of the photo-Fenton treatment. Also, the remaining strains, especially those of Salmonella spp. were achieved during the subsequent 24h of dark storage under the action of the Fenton process. Under uniquely solar radiation, total inactivation was recorded only in the total coliforms/E. coli strains. The impact of the available irradiance on the efficiency of the photo-Fenton disinfection of natural water was highlighted during the exposure under high intermittent solar radiation. The impact of the HCO3(-) concentration of both wells' water on the evolution of the pH during the photo-disinfection was recorded. Drastic decrease was noticed after the initial fast increase in presence of low HCO3(-) concentration while a steady state was observed after the increase in presence of higher concentration. The redox activities of the nitrogen components of the water during both photo-disinfection processes have led to increased concentration of nitrite in all the cases and variations were noticed in that of nitrate and ammonia.",
1735,"Effects of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River discharge on planktonic community respiration in the East China Sea Planktonic communities tend to flourish on the western margins of the East China Sea (ECS) fueled by substrates delivered largely from the Changjiang River, the fifth largest river in the world. To study the effects of the Changjiang River discharge on planktonic community respiration (CR), physical-chemical variables and key processes were measured in three consecutive summers in the ECS. Results showed that concentrations of nitrate and Chl a, protozoan biomass, bacterial production, as well as CR in the surface water were all negatively correlated with sea surface salinity, reflecting the strong influence of river discharge on the ECS shelf ecosystem. Moreover, mean values of nitrate, Chl a concentrations, and CR rates were proportionally related to the area of Changjiang diluted water (CDW; salinity <= 31.0 practical salinity units (psu)), an index of river discharge rate. Presumably, higher river flow delivers higher nutrient concentrations which stimulate phytoplankton growth, which in turn fuels CR. CR exhibited significant monthly and interannual variability, and rates appear to be dominated by bacteria and phytoplankton. Although the plankton community was relatively productive (mean = 0.8 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) in the CDW, the mean ratio of production to respiration was low (0.42). This suggests that the heterotrophic processes regulating CR were supported by riverine organic carbon input in addition to in situ autotrophic production.",
1736,"Groundwater quality in the suburban area of the city of Tijuana, Mexico Over the last few decades the population growth of the city of Tijuana has had an annual rate of 6% and the city is estimated to reach a population of 3.5 million people by the year 2020. This growth has placed great demand on the regional water resources. Therefore, it is important to know the actual state of local groundwater quality to protect and manage this resource. The objective of this study was to evaluate groundwater quality in a suburban area of the city of Tijuana, Mexico. Seven hand-dug wells and two surface water points were sampled during a period of 8 months for physicochemical parameters, bacteria and heavy metals. The results have shown that the groundwater quality of the aquifer is poor because of the number of pollution sources that includes horticultural activities, on site sanitation, infiltration from a polluted stream and domestic rearing. High nitrogen concentrations suggest that the main source of contamination is wastewater infiltration and the manure used in the horticulture activities. Based on the results, groundwater in this aquifer is not suitable for human consumption unless it is treated, because the concentration values for chemical and microbiological parameters are higher than the Mexican drinking water standard.",
1737,"Investigation of uranium and thorium activities and their isotopic ratios in environmental water samples in Tokushima, Japan, using extraction chromatography and samarium coprecipitation A highly sensitive separation procedure has been developed to investigate uranium and thorium activities and their isotopic ratios in environmental water samples in Tokushima, Japan. Uranium and thorium isotopes in environmental water samples were simultaneously isolated from interfering elements with extraction chromatography using an Eichrom UTEVA (TM) resin column. After the chemical separation, activities of U and Th isotopes coprecipitated with samarium fluoride (SmF3) were measured by alpha-spectrometry. It has been confirmed that uranium isotopes are isolated successfully from thorium decay chains by analyzing a test aqueous solution as a simulation of an environmental water sample. The separation procedure has been first applicable to the determination of U and Th activities and their isotopic ratios in a drinking well water named ""Kurashimizu"" in Tokushima City. Japan. The specific activities of U-238 and Th-232 in ""Kurashimizu"" were deduced to be within the upper limits of < 0.31 and < 0.19 mBq/l, respectively.",
1738,"Performance of Post-Processed Methods in Hydrological Predictions Evaluated by Deterministic and Probabilistic Criteria Meteorological Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP), which uses Ensemble Weather forecasts (EWFs) to drive hydrological models, is a useful methodology for extending forecast periods and to provide valuable uncertainty information to improve the operation of future water resources. However, raw EWFs are usually biased and under-dispersive and so cannot be directly used in ESP, leading to the development of several post-processing methods. The performance of these methods needs to be evaluated/compared in building ESP based on deterministic and probabilistic criteria. In addition, likely influencing factors also need to be identified. This study evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art methods: the Generator-based Post-Processing (GPP) method, Extended Logistic Regression (ExLR), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Affine Kernel Dressing (AKD), using a simple bias correction (BC) method as a benchmark. The evaluation was carried out over four watersheds with different basin areas in the humid region of central-south China based on the weather reforecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS). The results show that the performance of the post-processing methods varies with the forecast variable (precipitation, or air temperature or streamflow), but all of them outperform the BC and GEFS. For the four post-processing methods, the advantage of the generator-based methods (GPP and ExLR) lies in their probabilistic performance, which outperforms the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) by about 10% in precipitation forecasts and about 20% in streamflow forecasts, while the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) are better at their deterministic performance for precipitation forecasts, with a benefit of about 15%. Meanwhile, the post-processing methods generally perform better for precipitation and streamflow forecasts, but worse for air temperature forecasts for a bigger basin compared to the distribution-based methods. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering the uncertainty of post-processing methods in ESP.",
1739,"How Groundwater Level Fluctuations and Geotechnical Properties Lead to Asymmetric Subsidence: A PSInSAR Analysis of Land Deformation over a Transit Corridor in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area Los Angeles has experienced ground deformations during the past decades. These ground displacements can be destructive for infrastructure and can reduce the land capacity for groundwater storage. Therefore, this paper seeks to evaluate the existing ground displacement patterns along a new metro tunnel in Los Angeles, known as the Sepulveda Transit Corridor. The goal is to find the most crucial areas suffering from subsidence or uplift and to enhance the previous reports in this metropolitan area. For this purpose, we applied a Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar using 29 Sentinel-1A acquisitions from June 2017 to May 2018 to estimate the deformation rate. The assessment procedure demonstrated a high rate of subsidence in the Inglewood field that is near the study area of the Sepulveda Transit Corridor with a maximum deformation rate of 30 mm/yr. Finally, data derived from in situ instruments as groundwater level variations, GPS observations, and soil properties were collected and analyzed to interpret the results. Investigation of geotechnical boreholes indicates layers of fine-grained soils in some parts of the area and this observation confirms the necessity of more detailed geotechnical investigations for future constructions in the region. Results of investigating line-of-sight displacement rates showed asymmetric subsidence along the corridor and hence we proposed a new framework to evaluate the asymmetric subsidence index that can help the designers and decision makers of the project to consider solutions to control the current subsidence.",
1740,"Reservoir Regulation for Control of an Ancient Landslide Reactivated by Water Level Fluctuations in Heishui River, China Due to the complex geological processes of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, numerous deposits, especially the large-scale ancient landslide deposits, are characteristic features of the valleys incised in southwestern China. Intense water level fluctuations since 2011 in Maoergai Reservoir, China, registered the reactivation of Xierguazi ancient landslide, and presented a significant risk to neighboring facilities. Based on detailed field survey and drilling exploration, the landslide was divided into Zone A and Zone B, and other characterizations of landslide were studied as well. To precisely measure the extent of landslide displacement during filling and drawdown stage, surface displacement monitoring system was deployed on the landslide. The monitoring analyses data reveal that reservoir fluctuation is the dominant factor influencing landslide displacement, especially during drawdown stage. Moreover, a future sliding is anticipated in Zone A, while a creep had already existed in Zone B. A reservoir regulation was then established using the lead-lag correlation between reservoir fluctuation and landslide displacement and landslide stability analysis. In the end, the follow-up deformation monitoring demonstrates that the reservoir regulation controlled the landslide effectively. Landslide control by reservoir regulation in Maoergai can serve as a case study for other settlements involved in similar construction activities.",
1741,"Arsenic and Heavy Metal Concentrations in Drinking Water in Pakistan and Risk Assessment: A Case Study The present study was performed to assess drinking water quality and potential health risk in the Nowshera District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. For this purpose drinking water samples were collected from local available sources and analyzed for physico-chemical characteristics, arsenic (As) and heavy metals. Results revealed high levels of toxic heavy metals such as chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and As contaminations in the drinking water. Results were evaluated for chronic risk including average daily intake (ADI) and hazard quotient (HQ). Among heavy metals the HQ values were highest for Cd (5.80) and As (2.00). Therefore, populations in the study area may be at a low level of chronic toxicity and carcinogenic risk. Statistical analyses showed that contribution of different drinking water sources to the mean contaminant levels in the study area was insignificant (p =.53). Correlation analysis further revealed that anthropogenic activities were the main sources of contamination, rather than geogenic. This study strongly recommends the treatment of urban and industrial wastewater in the vicinity of the study area and provision of safe drinking water.",
1742,"Tectonic implication of drainage set-up in the Sub-Himalaya: A case study of Papumpare district, Arunachal Himalaya, India The Sub-Himalaya, deformed between the Main Boundary Thrust and/or Bomdila Thrust towards north and the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) towards south, is characterized by the presence of fault-propagated folds and an imbricate thrust system. Along the HFT, the mountain front is offset for about 10 km sinistrally along a NW-SE trending transverse fault, the Banderdewa Fault, which runs through the Dikrang River valley that seems to have followed a pull-apart basin developed along the Banderdewa Fault. The western part of study area, associated with a major folding, faulting and the development of fault-bounded Quaternary basins with normal faulting along their northern margins, is interpreted to be tectonically more transported towards southeast than the eastern part where no Quaternary basins are developed. The channel forms and landforms have been studied in relation to the neotectonics of the area. The watersheds exhibit their structurally controlled nature, with drainages following tectonic alignments. Rivers/streams experienced compressed meandering, narrowing, widening and deflection of channels. Longitudinal profiles of river/stream channels exhibit knick points. Unpaired terraces are observed at higher levels. Factors like the unconsolidated Siwalik rocks, tectonic instability along faults and high rainfall with the advent of the Holocene, led to the development of the present-day drainage set-up. A tectonic model is proposed for development of tectonic geomorphology of the area influenced by ultra-tremor to low magnitude earthquakes in seismically very active northeastern India, as moderate to big earthquakes (M >= 6.0) are scarce in this region.

1743,"Formation mechanisms of paleokarst and karst collapse columns of the Middle Cambrian-Lower Ordovician carbonates in Huainan coalfield, Northern China Karst water in the Middle Cambrian-Lower Ordovician carbonates is the ecological resources and domestic water in the Huainan coalfield (Anhui Province, China), but it also directly threatens the safe production of coal mines due to the development of paleokarst and karst collapse columns (KCCs). Most of the Middle Cambrian-Lower Ordovician carbonates in Northern China experienced multistage tectonic movements and were affected by multi-type corrosive fluids, but very few studies focused on the effect of multistage fluid-rock reaction on the formation of paleokarst and KCCs. To investigate the formation mechanisms and characteristics of paleokarst and KCCs, this study integrated petrographic studies, isotope geochemistry (C and O) and minor elements (Ba, Mn, and Sr), and clarified the sources and types of corrosive fluids. Through this study, meteoric water, formation water, hydrothermal fluids, and mixing fluids were determined as the four main types of corrosive fluids that formed pores, vugs, fractures, caves, and KCCs in the Middle Cambrian-Lower Ordovician carbonates. The meteoric dissolution is controlled by carbonic acid solution recharge conditions which affect the karst development in the Cambrian and Ordovician paleoweathering crusts and local carbonate outcrops. Hydrothermal fluids with high-temperature, high-pressure and high-corrosivity can develop a strong hydrothermal pore-fracture system in the Cambrian carbonate, which is the reason that KCCs can develop in the Cambrian strata in the Huainan coalfield. The mixing dissolution is controlled by sulfuric acid dissolution and usually occurs in the water tables and the fault and fracture zones, which are conducive to the development of caves and KCCs. In addition to the above four corrosive fluids, the development of paleokarst and KCCs in the Huainan area is also controlled by stratigraphic lithology and geological structures, especially for faults and fractures, which are the main migration channels of corrosive fluids. An evolution model of paleokarst and KCCs was established, providing a plausible interpretation for better understanding of the spatial distribution of paleokarst and KCCs. In practice, this study provides critical references for predicting the spatial distribution of paleokarst and KCCs in Northern China coalfields, as well as the exploration and development of karst water around the world.",
1744,"Solidification/stabilization of landfill leachate concentrate using different aggregate materials The application of reverse osmosis for the treatment of landfill leachate is becoming widespread in Turkey as well as in Europe. A major drawback of this process is the production of concentrate, which could be as much as 30% of the feed stream, and high concentrations of salts and contaminants. The reverse osmosis concentrate is disposed of by using several methods including re-infiltration, drying, incineration and solidification/stabilization. In this study, solidification/stabilization (S/S) technology was studied for the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate produced from landfill leachate. In order to benefit from its capability to absorb heavy metals, ammonia and some other pollutants, zeolite and different aggregate materials were used in solidification experiments. Main pollutants in the leachate concentrate, TOC, DOC, TDS and ammonia were successfully solidified and approximately 1% of TOC, DOC, TDS and ammonia remained in the eluate water. The results indicated that the landfill disposal limits could be attained by solidification/stabilization process.",
1745,"Palaeontological and sedimentological characteristics of the Changhsingian (Late Permian) platform-margin sponge reef and intraplatform skeletal mound in NE Sichuan Basin, South China: their palaeoenvironmental implications Well-preserved fossil reef/mound-building communities and shallow microfacies have been recovered from Changhsingian platform-margin sponge reef at the Panlongdong Section and intraplatform sponge skeletal mound at the Yanggudong Section in NE Sichuan Basin, South China. The present contribution focuses on the palaeoenvironmental implication of the differentiated development processes on the platform-margin reef and intraplatform skeletal mound based on the palaeontology and sedimentology. Precise field assessments and macroscopic/microscopic qualitative observations led to the identification of five reef/mound-building community and 14 reef/mound-related microfacies in the 2 sections of Changxing Formation. In the Panlongdong platform-margin sponge reef, reef-building communities are recognized into Amblysiphonella Community, Preperonidella-Amblysiphonella Community, and Preperonidella-Sollasia Community in ascending order. The reef-related microfacies are mainly classified into calcisphere-pelletoid wackestone to packstone, crinoidal wackestone to packstone of shallow water bank environment, hypercalcified sponge bafflestone, calcareous algae-hypercalcified sponge binding framestone, hypercalcifed sponge-calcareous algae bindstone, and calcareous algae-hypercalcifed sponge rudstone of reef environment, and benthic foraminifera-calcareous algae wackestone to packstone of shallower water lagoon environment. Two mound-building communities can only be found in the Yanggudong intraplatform skeletal mound, including Preperonidella-Intrasporeocoelia Community of lower part and Preperonidella-Sollasia Community of upper part. The mound-related microfacies include calcisphere-calcareous algae wackestone to packstone, crinoidal wackestone to packstone and crinoidal packstone to grainstone of shallow water bank environment, hypercalcified sponge bafflestone and cyanobacteria-hypercalcified sponge binding bafflestone of skeletal mound environment, benthic foraminifera-calcareous algae packstone grainstone of shallower water bank environment and benthic foraminifera-calcareous algae wackestone to packstone of shallower water lagoon environment. These palaeontological and sedimentological analysis results have facilitated the classification of sponge reef and skeletal mound sections corresponding to a solitary shallow benthic zone into multiple microfacies attributed to variable environmental depositional conditions. The differentiated evolutional process of multiple reef/mound-building stages at the Panlongdong and Yanggudong sections clearly demonstrate a general shallowing-upward trend from an inner shelf setting to a supratidal and low energy lagoon environment.",
1746,"Processes shaping wintering waterbird communities in an intensive modified landscape: Neutral assembly with dispersal limitation and localized competition Better understanding of the mechanisms structuring ecological communities is not only a long-term theoretical pursuit in ecology but also critical for biodiversity conservation. Here, we used two complementary approaches (0-diversity partitioning, and phylogenetic and functional null models) to explore the processes structuring wintering waterbird communities in the floodplain lakes of middle-lower Yangtze River (MLYR), China. We found that 1) neutral assembly might be the predominant process shaping the composition of wintering waterbird communities in MLYR; 2) compared to environmental factors, spatial variables, in particular those describing the large scale spatial structure among lakes, contributed more in explaining the functional and phylogenetic composition variations across the region, indicating dispersal constraints might strongly mediate neutral processes. The dispersal constraint could be imposed by movement barriers caused by anthropogenic landscape modification, site fidelity, or both; and 3) strong dispersal constraints could lead to competitive exclusion superimposed over neutrally assembly isolated communities, a hypothesis confirmed by the alpha-and 0-null models. These findings provide strong support for the importance of conserving and improving ecological connectivity at the regional scale as well as habitat quality enhancement at lake scale.",
1747,"Quantification of aluminum and heavy metal contents in cooked rice samples from Thailand markets using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and potential health risk assessment This work quantified contents of Al and heavy metals, namely Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb, in cooked rice samples prepared using five different cooking utensils (new and used Al cookers, a Teflon-coated Al cooker, a stainless steel cooker, and a glass beaker) and four different water conditions (tap water, de-ionized water, acidic water, and basic water) in order to assess metal leaching from cooking utensils and potential health risks to local consumers. The result showed that Al contents (76.50 mg kg(-1) in raw rice and 76.83 mg kg(-1) in cooked rice samples) and Zn contents (22.86 mg kg(-1) in raw rice and 22.43 mg kg(-1) in cooked rice samples) represented the two largest contents of tested elements, in which contents of Al > Zn > Fe > Pb Cu > Cr >As approximate to Cd. However, no strong indication of substantial metal leaching from cooking utensils to cooked rice were observed in this work as the metal contents in cooked rice samples did not significantly differ from raw rice grains (p < 0.05). The result also indicated that the estimated weekly intake of Al and Pb associated with rice consumption of a person who consumed approximately 0.3 kg of rice per day (181.07 mg kg(-1) week(-1) and 4.85 mg kg(-1) week(-1), respectively) was greater than the provisional tolerance weekly intake (PTWI) recommended by the joint FAO/WHO committee for a person who weighs 60 kg (120 mg kg(-1) week(-1) and 1.5 mg kg(-1) week(-1), respectively). In terms of the assessment of non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks, the hazard index (HI) calculated from all concerned metals was 9.18, with the largest contributions from Pb (3.19), As (2.67), and Al (1.51), indicating a potential non-carcinogenic risk, while the total cancer risk (CRt) was 2.45 x 10(-)(2), with the largest contributions from Pb (1.0 x 10(-2)) and Cd (1.2 x 10(-2)), indicating serious carcinogenic risks to local consumers.",
1748,"Dehydration and diffusion of radiogenic argon in sericites from massif sulfide deposits of the Belokan-Shekin metallogenic zone, southern slope of the Greater Caucasus, Azerbaijan The dehydration, iron oxidation, and diffusion of radiogenic argon (Ar-40(r)) on heating in air at 373-1273 K were studied for sericites from sericite schists hosting the Katsdag and Filizchai deposits of the Belokan-Shekin metallogenic zone, Azerbaijan. It was established that ferrous iron oxidation, as well as water and Ar-40(r) release, begin at 573 K, are most significant (up to similar to80%) within the range 573-1073 K, and are very slow of 4 at 1073-1273 K. Within 893-1080 K, the semilogarithmic dependences Ar-40(r). diffusion coefficients and of 4 dehydration rates display an inflection point. The ""poles"" Ar-40(r) diffusion and dehydration were calculated from experimental data, and the fulfillment of the compensation law of diffusion was established. The empirical equation E = 30.02 + 3.321n(D-0/a(2)) was obtained, which satisfactorily describes the experimental results. Using experimental data on parameters of Ar-40(r) diffusion, as well as mineral age (t) and the radioactive decay constant of potassium (lambda), the disturbing parameters were obtained for decay-diffusion equation (F-0/lambdat), where F-0 = (D/a(2))(273) (K)tau is the Fourier criterion. The criterion of Ar-40(r) retention in the mineral is a low value of (F-0/lambdat) much less than 1. For the sericites studied, these respective parameters are 4 X 10(-10), 6 x 10(-13), and 2 x 10(-15) much less than 1, which are much lower than one. This indicates that sericite can serve as an important K-Ar geochronometer for dating ore occurrences and low-grade metamorphic rocks.",
1749,"A new version of a low concentration evacuated tube solar collector: Optical and thermal investigation This work is focused on investigating the performance of a new version of evacuated tube solar collector with and without solar tracking system. The evacuated tube solar collector is composed of an absorbing copper tube positioned eccentrically inside a transparent glass cover tube which has a reflective film insert on its inner surface and vacuum in eccentric annular space. Modeling of the proposed evacuated tube collector is based on the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy and discretized by using the finite volumes method. A home-built numerical code is developed, tested and its grid size optimized. This code is validated against available experimental and numerical results. Effects of the tilt angle and tracking systems are also evaluated. The results showed maximum and minimum daily efficiencies of the collector of about 73% and 42%, respectively. The annual efficiency of this collector was evaluated as 61.5% for the city of Sao Luis, Brazil. The new contributions from the present work include the reflective film, the eccentricity of the absorber and the presence of vacuum in the annular space. The reflective film helps to keep the absorber at uniform temperature and reduce thermal induced stress. The eccentricity is introduced to create concentration effect which helps to increase the outlet temperature of the working fluid and reduce the mass of the collector system. The presence of vacuum in the eccentric annular space reduces effectively the thermal losses, improves the efficiency.",
1750,"Scattering properties of soot-containing particles and their impact by humidity in 1.6 mu m Short-wave infrared (SWIR) band in wavelength near 1.6 mu m is one of the key bands used for satellite observation of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). However, one major uncertainty to use this band for the CO2 retrieval is the scattering by cloud and aerosol particles. To better understand the scattering properties of soot-containing particles in this band, this paper studied the scattering properties for three typical types of soot-containing particles in China: (I) internal mixture, (II) pure soot aggregate, and (III) semi-external 'mixture. Assumed as single non-spherical particle for type I, its scattering property is computed using the T-matrix method combined with the Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory and the hygroscopic growth theory. For types II and III, a particle-cluster aggregation algorithm is employed to generate fractal-like aggregates, and their scattering properties are computed using the Core-Mantle Generalized Multi-sphere Mie-solution method combined with the hygroscopic growth theory of both monomers and aggregated particles. The simulated results demonstrate that their scattering properties are quite different and strongly impacted by the levels of relative humidity (RH). For type I, the RH plays a much more important role than the morphology in impacting the scattering properties, and the scattering phase functions among different shaped particles have a larger difference for larger particles and higher RH. For type II, both the RH and morphology significantly affect its scattering properties. The single scattering albedo (omega) can be underestimated up to similar to 50% without considering the effects of RH and morphological changes. For type III, its scattering properties mainly depend on the RH and the size of the large water-soluble particle. Although the enlarged soot aggregate, which is attached to a water-soluble particle, almost does not change the light direction, it can result in a significant reduction in omega (similar to 0.15) at low RH for small particles. By comparing the scattering parameters of wet particles at a certain RH level with the dry ones, the impact by the heterogeneity of aerosols generally becomes larger with the increase of RH, but becomes smaller with the increase of particle size. These results suggest that, although the water vapor absorption itself is small in 1.6 pm CO2 band, it can significantly impact the scattering properties of these particles through its effect on the hygroscopic growth of the non-spherical and heterogeneous aerosols. This impact should be taken into account in the retrieval of CO2 using 1.6 mu m as well as other related remote sensing applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1751,"""All for some"": water inequity in Zambia and Zimbabwe In southern Africa, gross disparities in access to water are symptomatic of the overall uneven pattern of development. Despite post-independence egalitarian rhetoric, in countries such as Zambia and Zimbabwe inappropriate models (piped house connections in the urban areas, high technology irrigation schemes in the agricultural sector), combined with weak macro-economies and poorly formulated sectoral policies have actually exacerbated the disparities. Zero or very low tariffs have played a major role in this. Although justified as being consistent with water's special status, inadequate tariffs in fact serve to undermine any programme of making water accessible to all. This has led to a narrowing of development options, resulting in exclusivist rather than inclusivist development, and stagnation rather than dynamism. A major part of the explanation for perpetuation of such unsatisfactory outcomes is the existence of political interest groups who benefit from the status quo. The first case study in the paper involves urban water consumers in Zambia, where those with piped water connections seek to continue the culture of low tariffs which is by now deeply embedded. The result is that the water supply authorities (in this case the newly formed, but still politically constrained 'commercialised utilities') are unable even to maintain adequate supplies to the piped customers, let alone extend service to the peri-urban dwellers, 56% of whom do not have access to safe water. The paper outlines some modest, workable principles to achieve universal, affordable access to water in the urban areas, albeit through a mix of service delivery mechanisms. In a second case study of rural productive water in Zimbabwe, the reasons for only 2% of the rural subsistence farming households being involved in formal small-scale irrigation schemes 20 years after independence are explored. Again, a major part of the explanation lies in government pursuing a water delivery model which is not affordable or sustainable on a wide scale. Its provision, via substantial capital and recurrent subsidies, for a small group has a large opportunity cost for society as a whole. The small-scale irrigators have a vested interest in ensuring that the subsidies are maintained, but in the process continue to absorb a disproportionate amount of resources which could be used for development elsewhere. By choosing simpler, cheaper water technologies, and assisting farmers with growing and marketing high value crops, the resources could instead be used to benefit a much larger proportion of households. With well designed programmes aimed at achieving equity, large numbers of subsistence farmers could improve their incomes and start working their way out of poverty. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1752,"RADON IN GROUNDWATER OF MAGADI TALUK, RAMANAGARA DISTRICT IN KARNATAKA Radon is a water-soluble radioactive noble gas produced from the alpha decay of Ra-226 in uranium series. Its presence in drinking water and open air increases the risk of lung and intestinal cancers in human beings. In view of this, radon concentration in groundwater and its dose due to inhalation and ingestion to the population of Magadi taluk of Ramanagara district in Karnataka state, India was studied. The groundwater samples were analyzed for radon concentration using emanometry technique. The study showed that the radon concentration in this area varied from 27.4 +/- 1.0 to 167.5 +/- 3.9 Bq/L and the effective dose ranged from 104.2 +/- 2.7 to 636.2 +/- 11.0 mu Sv/a. The study also revealed that 95% of the 37 samples studied showed higher radon concentration compared to the UNSCEAR recommendation (40 Bq/L) and all the samples showed higher than the USEPA recommendation (11.1 Bq/L). Ten samples have concentration above the maximum permissible level prescribed by WHO (100 Bq/L). The groundwater samples are found to be slightly alkaline within the permissible limit of Indian Standards.",
1753,"DETERMINATION OF SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF HEAVY METALS ANI PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN SAKIZ POND (KASTAMONU-TURKEY) The main objective of this study was to determine physicochemical parameters and heavy metal concentrations for Sakiz Pond, Kastamonu-Turkey. Thus the water quality properties were assessed, the pollution problems were revealed, the suitability levels in terms of aquatic life and drinking water were determined and the quality of water in accordance with the Surface Water Quality Management Regulation (SWQMR) criteria was classified. In total, 21 physicochemical parameters and 7 heavy metals were investigated for water quality assessment of the studied pond between March 2015 and February 2016. This study was carried out through monthly sampling during 1 year, in 3 stations at Sakiz Pond. Temperature, pH, salinity and electrical conductivity parameters were obtained from the field using a multiparameter. The analyses of nitrite, nitrate, ammoniac, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+), chloride, phosphate, sulfate, sulfite, potassium, calcium, sodium and magnesium were conducted by using EACH LANGE brand DR 6000 laboratory type spectrophotometer and the analyses of the heavy metals were conducted by using a gas chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The water quality in study area was found to be Class I according to the Surface Water Quality Management Regulation, and also this water was found as suitable in terms of drinking water quality. The results of this study will provide a data baseline for future studies on subsequent evaluations of possible future environmental contamination, and also this study will be the baseline data for future ecological studies and conservation and management of the water resources of Kastamonu-Turkey.",
1754,"Evaluation of arsenic contamination and potential risks assessment through water, soil and rice consumption This study was carried to assess the arsenic (As) contamination in water, soil, and rice. Surface-water (n=120), soil (n=102), and rice plants (n=50) samples were collected from the Sewakht (rural) and Chitral city (urban) areas, Pakistan, and analyzed for As concentration. The average concentration of As were 2 and 2 mu g/L in water, 0.67 and 0.07 mg/kg in soil, and 0.03 and 0.03 mg/kg in rice grain of rural and urban, respectively. Determined As concentration in surface-water, soil, and rice grains were used for the assessment of the potential risks. The mean hazard quotients (HQ) values through water consumption for adults and children were within the threshold limits. For water consumption, the cancerous risk (R) of adults and children were 7.4% and 3.03% in rural, while 6.06% and 1.85% in urban, respectively. Soil (7%) exhibited R for rural-children only. The mean HQ values through rice consumption were within the limit for children and adults. This study revealed that As contamination in water could result in various health problems for the local community in the future. Therefore, they need to be provided safe and clean drinking water.

1755,"RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS IN GROUNDWATERS FROM THE OSAMU UTSUMI MINE AND MORRO-DO-FERRO ANALOG STUDY SITES, POCOS-DE-CALDAS, BRAZIL Data are presented on rare-earth elements (REE) in prefiltered ( < 450 rum) near-surface and deeper groundwaters and in corresponding particulate matter (> 450 nm) from the Osamu Utsumi uranium mine and the Morro do Ferro thorium-REE-deposit. Groundwaters from both sites typically contain between 1-50 mug/l of total REE, but can reach values of up to 160 mug/l in the deepest borehole F4 (U-mine: 150-415 m). Even higher REE concentrations of up to 29 mg/l were measured in acidic, sulfate-rich near-surface waters of the same site. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns in deeper, more reducing groundwaters and in their corresponding suspended particle fractions are similar to those observed in the bedrock (phonolites), indicating that bedrock leaching and secondary mineral sorption occurred without significant fractionation between these elements, in accordance with the only small variations in the stability constants of the expected REE-sulfate complexes in these waters. Groundwaters from the unsaturated zone of both sites show a very characteristic cerium depletion (less pronounced than that observed in the corresponding suspended particulate fractions), which is most probably related to the oxidation of Ce (III) under the prevailing E(h)-conditions of these waters (600 to 800 mV), and to sorption/precipitation reactions of the much less soluble Ce(IV) species. Coarse particulate matter (> 450 nm), composed mainly of amorphous ferric hydrous oxides, has a strong capacity for sorption of REE. This is shown by its very high REE concentrations, in some boreholes > 8,000 mug/g (total REE), and by the calculated association ratios R(a) (ml/g), which are in the order of 10(5) to 10(6) . The implications of these findings for the migration behavior of REE in both environments are discussed.",
1756,"Motor alterations associated with exposure to manganese in the environment in Mexico Overexposure to manganese (Mn) causes neurotoxicity (a Parkinson-like syndrome) or psychiatric damage (""manganese madness""). Several studies have shown alterations to motor and neural behavior associated with exposure to Mn in the workplace. However, there are few studies on the effects of environmental exposure of whole populations. We studied the risk of motor alterations in people living in a mining district in Mexico. We studied 288 individual people (168 women and 120 men) from eight communities at various distances from manganese extraction or processing facilities in the district of Molango. We measured manganese concentrations in airborne particles, water, soil and crops and evaluated the possible routes of Mn exposure. We also took samples of people's blood and determined their concentrations of Mn and lead (Pb). We used ""Esquema de DiagnÃ³stico NeuropsicolÃ³gico"" Ardila and Ostrosky-SolÃ­s's neuropsychological battery to evaluate motor functions. Concentrations of Mn in drinking water and maize grain were less than detection limits at most sampling sites. Manganese extractable by DTPA in soils ranged between 6 and 280 mg kg(-1) and means were largest close to Mn extraction or processing facilities. Air Mn concentration ranged between 0.003 and 5.86 microg/m(3); the mean value was 0.42 microg/m(3) and median was 0.10 microg/m(3), the average value (geometric mean) resulted to be 0.13 microg/m(3). Mean blood manganese concentration was 10.16 microg/l, and geometric mean 9.44 microg/l, ranged between 5.0 and 31.0 mcrog/l. We found no association between concentrations of Mn in blood and motor tests. There was a statistically significant association between Mn concentrations in air and motor tests that assessed the coordination of two movements (OR 3.69; 95% CI 0.9, 15.13) and position changes in hand movements (OR 3.09; CI 95% 1.07, 8.92). An association with tests evaluating conflictive reactions (task that explores verbal regulations of movements) was also found (OR 2.30; CI 95% 1.00, 5.28). It seems from our results that people living close to the manganese mines and processing plants suffer from an incipient motor deficit, as a result of their inhaling manganese-rich dust.",
1757,"Effect of Soil Moisture on the Epigeic Arthropods Diversity in Steppe Landscape The consequences of global climate change are a decrease in precipitation as well as an increase in the length of the period with high temperatures from spring to autumn. The climate change intensified the negative consequences of land reclamation and regulation of rivers by dams in Ukraine in the 20th century. The modern landscape of the Circum-Pontic and Circum-Azov regions in Ukraine has undergone desertification, and a multiple reduction in the freshwater runoff has manifested itself in a violation of the water balance of soils and their salinization. In addition to the climate change and anthropic landscape transformations, most upland areas in southern Ukraine have been converted into farmland, systematically fertilized and treated with pesticides and herbicides. Total plowing of the territory also led to soil erosion and degradation. The global climate change and the impact of human activity have affected the diversity of the steppe fauna as well. The questions of the influence of soil humidity on the diversity of epigeic arthropods were considered on the example of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Soil moisture is one of the key factors that determines their diversity.",
1758,"Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation Interactions over Iraq Using MODIS Satellite Data and HYSPLIT Model During (2008-2017) In this work, spatial and temporal variations of aerosols parameters namely AOD, AI and AE were investigated with spatial resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees over Iraq (28.5 degrees-38.5 degrees N, 38.5 degrees- 48.25 degrees E); data have been retrieved from January 2008 to December 2017 by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were analyzed which can lead to modifications in the microphysics of clouds as well. The highest values for AOD and AI were observed in summer and spring, by contrast, minimum AOD and AI values were found in winter and autumn, while the highest values of AE were recorded in winter and autumn and the lower values were found in summer and spring. Furthermore, the relationships between AOD, AE and live cloud parameters, namely, cloud fraction (CF), water vapor (WV), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER), and precipitation (PPT) have been investigated by employing spatial correlation maps for their data values. The analysis showed a strong negative correlation between AOD and AE particularly in the western region (Rutba). AOD showed a negative relationship with COT in the whole of Iraq. AOD and CER presented a positive relation along the arid desert region extended from west northern region to the west southern region passing through the western region of Iraq. The correlation between AOD and CF showed a negative correlation (similar to-0.5). The correlation between AOD and WV was positive (similar to 0.7) especially in the stripe joint between the middle and the northern region. The relationship between AOD and PPT showed a negative correlation over whole of Iraq. The correlation results between AE and cloud parameter were opposite to that between AOD and cloud parameter except CER was the same correlation result for both. The correlations between AI and cloud parameters were also investigated. In present study, cluster analysis on 7-day isentropic air mass backward trajectories has been used for the all days of the year employing HYSPLIT model. Cluster analysis determines the air mass source regions, which were reached the different selected cities (Mosul, Baghdad, Rutba, Al-Nukhib, Nasiriyah and Basrah).",
1759,"Activated Carbon from Food Waste Activated carbons are considered to be the most successful adsorbent materials due to their high adsorption capacity for the majority of pollutants, e.g. dyes, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, phenols. They possess large surface area, and different surface functional groups, which include carboxyl, carbonyl, phenol, quinone, lactone and other groups bound to the edges of the graphite-like layers. Therefore, they are regarded as good adsorbents both in liquid and gas phases. The most widely used carbonaceous materials for the industrial production of activated carbons are coal, wood and coconut shell. These types of precursors are quite expensive and often imported, in many places; hence making it necessary, particularly for developing countries, to find a cheap and available feedstock for the preparation of activated carbon for use in industry, drinking water purification and wastewater treatment. In order to reduce the synthesis cost of activated carbons, some green final products are recently proposed, using several suitable agricultural by-products (lignocellulosics) - i.e. including olive-waste cakes, cattle-manue compost, bamboo materials, apple pulp, potato peel - as activated carbon precursors. In this chapter, special attention is given to activated carbons based on some of agricultural wastes from the Mediterranean region, which can be characterized as green.",
1760,"Geochemical behaviour of major and trace elements in dissolved and particulate phases of the Bouregreg river (Morocco) The Bouregreg river is one of the main rivers of Morocco, Its source being located in the Moroccan Central Massif and flows towards the Atlantic coast through the coastal Meseta. The Bouregreg river basin is located in the Moroccan Central Massif which consists mainly of Palaeozoic formations that were subject to the Hercynian orogeny. To evaluate the environmental status of the Bouregreg river water, sampling of the dissolved (< 0.22 mu m) and suspended (> 0.22 mu m) phases was performed at 10 sites along the Bouregreg river and its tributaries in the winter of 2005. Major (Na, Ca, K, Ti, Mn, Al and Fe), trace (As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Hf, Li, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sn, Sr, Ta, Th, U, V, W, Y, Zn and Zr) elements and rare earth elements were analysed. The dissolved and particulate phase of the Bouregreg river draining these contrasting zones show similar characteristics to those observed in other major tropical rivers such as the Congo and Amazon, and vary in composition between the different source areas. Obtained data show that the spectra of the standardized concentrations for all the determined elements in the dissolved and the suspended phase have the same form whatever the station and that the whole of the elements is strongly deficient compared to the upper continental crust. The strong depletion in the suspended phase and the associated enrichment in the dissolved phase suggest that some elements such as Rb, Ba and Sr are the most mobile elements during the weathering processes. The removal of the most mobile elements from the bedrock concentrates all remaining elements in the weathered phases of the soils, from whence it can be removed mechanically. As and Sb are strongly enriched as well in the dissolved load as in the suspended load.",
1761,"Using partial penetrating wells and curtains to lower the water level of confined aquifer of gravel To address the difficulties of penetrating and dewatering of a deep and thick confined aquifer of gravel, a dewatering approach that considers the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity of aquifer, co-work of partial penetrating curtains, and partial penetrating pumping wells was developed. Using the deep foundation pit of the southern ventilation shaft of Metro Line 1 in Hangzhou, China, as an example, a numerical simulation model based on finite difference method was established to invert the parameters and determine the co-work of partial penetrating curtains and wells. The anisotropic characteristic of the aquifer indicated that the three-dimensional flow caused by partial penetrating wells produced bigger drawdown. By co-working with the partial penetrating wells, the partial penetrating curtains changed the horizontal flow to a vertical one, lengthened the flow path, and consumed more energy to produce bigger drawdown. Three simulation schemes with different lengths, depths of well screen, and pumping rates were performed. The results indicated that a short screen for the pumping well embedded by curtains resulted in the biggest drawdown with minimum pumping rate. Based on numerical simulations, four pumping wells with 4 m-long screens embedded by curtains were installed inside the excavation zone. The water level declined to the required drawdown, which indicated that the approach is feasible and can provide solutions to problems on similar projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

1762,"Neurocysticercosis Among Zambian Children and Adolescents With Human Immunodeficiency Virus: A Geographic Information Systems Approach Background: Neurocysticercosis is the most common parasitic infection of the brain and a leading cause of epilepsy in resource-limited settings. Although neurocysticercosis and human immunodeficiency virus coinfections have commonly been reported, there are few data on how they interact. As part of an observational study of human immunodeficiency virus and cognition in Lusaka, Zambia, we identified a cluster of subjects with neurocysticercosis. We hypothesized that the neighborhood of residence may be an important factor driving clustering of neurocysticercosis and used a geographic information systems approach to investigate this association. Methods: A total of 34 subjects with human immunodeficiency virus and 13 subjects without human immunodeficiency virus (aged eight to 17 years) enrolled in the HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Zambia study, had magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed, and were evaluated for neurocysticercosis. Quantitative geographic information systems was utilized to investigate the relationship between neighborhood of residence, HIV, and neurocysticercosis. Results: Three of 34 subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (8.82%) and one of 13 controls were found to have neurocysticercosis. Geographic cluster analysis demonstrated that all subjects with neurocysticercosis were clustered in two adjacent neighborhoods (Chawama and Kanyama) with lower rates of piped water (Chawama: 22.8%, Kanyama: 26.7%) and flush toilets (Chawama: 14.0%, Kanyama: 14.0%) than the surrounding neighborhoods. Conclusion: We describe a cluster of patients with both neurocysticercosis and human immunodeficiency virus in Lusaka. Cases of neurocysticercosis clustered in neighborhoods with low rates of piped water and limited access to flush toilets. Geographic information systems may be a useful approach for studying the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus and neurocysticercosis. Larger studies are necessary to further investigate this association. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
1763,"Water Level Reconstruction and Prediction Based on Space-Borne Sensors: A Case Study in the Mekong and Yangtze River Basins Water level (WL) measurements denote surface conditions that are useful for monitoring hydrological extremes, such as droughts and floods, which both affect agricultural productivity and regional development. Due to spatially sparse in situ hydrological stations, remote sensing measurements that capture localized instantaneous responses have recently been demonstrated to be a viable alternative to WL monitoring. Despite a relatively good correlation with WL, a traditional passive remote sensing derived WL is reconstructed from nearby remotely sensed surface conditions that do not consider the remotely sensed hydrological variables of a whole river basin. This method's accuracy is also limited. Therefore, a method based on basin-averaged, remotely sensed precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and gravimetrically derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) is proposed for WL reconstruction in the Yangtze and Mekong River basins in this study. This study examines the WL reconstruction performance from these two remotely sensed hydrological variables and their corresponding drought indices (i.e., TRMM Standardized Precipitation Index (TRMM-SPI) and GRACE Drought Severity Index (GRACE-DSI)) on a monthly temporal scale. A weighting procedure is also developed to explore a further potential improvement in the WL reconstruction. We found that the reconstructed WL derived from the hydrological variables compares well to the observed WL. The derived drought indices perform even better than those of their corresponding hydrological variables. The indices' performance rate is owed to their ability to bypass the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in a standardized form and their basin-wide integrated information. In general, all performance indicators (i.e., the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Root-mean-squares error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE)) reveal that the remotely sensed hydrological variables (and their corresponding drought indices) are better alternatives compared with traditional remote sensing indices (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), despite different geographical regions. In addition, almost all results are substantially improved by the weighted averaging procedure. The most accurate WL reconstruction is derived from a weighted TRMM-SPI for the Mekong (and Yangtze River basins) and displays a PCC of 0.98 (and 0.95), a RMSE of 0.19 m (and 0.85 m), and a NSE of 0.95 (and 0.89); by comparison, the remote sensing variables showed less accurate results (PCC of 0.88 (and 0.82), RMSE of 0.41 m (and 1.48 m), and NSE of 0.78 (and 0.67)) for its inferred WL. Additionally, regardless of weighting, GRACE-DSI displays a comparable performance. An external assessment also shows similar results. This finding indicates that the combined usage of remotely sensed hydrological variables in a standardized form and the weighted averaging procedure could lead to an improvement in WL reconstructions for river basins affected by ENSO events and hydrological extremes.",
1764,"Cost effectiveness of community led total sanitation in Ethiopia and Ghana We conducted cost effectiveness analyses of four different CLTS interventions implemented in Ethiopia and Ghana. In each country, a pilot approach in which additional local actors were trained in CLTS facilitation was compared to the conventional approach. Data were collected using bottom-up costing, household surveys, and observations. We assessed variability of cost effectiveness from a societal perspective for latrine ownership and latrine use outcomes in different contexts. Cost effectiveness ranged from $34-$1897 per household ($5.85-$563 per person) gaining access to a private latrine or stopping open defecation, depending on the intervention, context, and outcome considered. For three out of four interventions, CLTS appeared more cost effective at reducing open defecation than at increasing latrine ownership, although sensitivity analysis revealed considerable variation. The pilot approaches were more cost effective at reducing open defecation than conventional approaches in Ethiopia, but not in Ghana. CLTS has been promoted as a low-cost means of improving the ownership and use of sanitation facilities. In our study, the cost of CLTS per household gaining latrine access was slightly higher than in other studies, and the cost of CLTS per household stopping OD was slightly lower than in other studies. Our results show that aggregate measures mask considerable variability in costs and outcomes, and thus the importance of considering and reporting context and uncertainty in economic analysis of sanitation interventions.",
1765,"[Estimated nutrient export loads based on improved export coefficient model in Xitiaoxi watershed] It is very important to estimate nutrient export loads from watershed, which is beneficial to water environmental management. The export coefficients for major land use types were evaluated by field surveying data, in addition the spatial distributions of precipitation and runoff were considered, to improve on export coefficient model (ECM), then integrated ECM into geographical information system to compose half-distribution model of export coefficients. Estimated nutrients export loads based on the ECM in Xitiaoxi watershed located upper of Taihu Lake area. Results show that the export load for TN and TP was 2 121.3 t and 49.3 t respectively, which provides important reference value for nonpoint source pollution management.",
1766,"Assessment of probable causes of chlorine decay in water distribution systems of Gaborone city, Botswana Gaborone city water distribution system (GCWDS) is rapidly expanding and has been faced with the major problems of high water losses due to leakage, water shortages due to drought and inadequate chlorine residuals at remote areas of the network. This study investigated the probable causes of chlorine decay, due to pipe wall conditions and distribution system water quality in the GCWDS. An experimental approach, which applied a pipe-loop network model to estimate biofilm growth and chlorine reaction rate constants, was used to analyse pipe wall chlorine decay. Also, effects of key water quality parameters on chlorine decay were analysed. The water quality parameters considered were: natural organic matter (measured by total organic carbon, TOC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC; and ultraviolet absorbance at wavelength 254, UVA-254, as surrogates), inorganic compounds (iron and manganese) and heterotrophic plate count (IIPC). Samples were collected from selected locations in the GCWDS for analysis of water quality parameters. The results of biofilm growth and chlorine reaction rate constants revealed that chlorine decay was higher in pipe walk than in the bulk of water in the GCWDS. The analysis of key water quality parameters revealed the presence of TOC, DOC and significant levels of organics (measured by UVA-254), which suggests that organic compounds contributed to chlorine decay in the GCWDS. However, low amounts of iron and manganese (< 0.3 mg/L) indicated that inorganic compounds may have had insignificant contributions to chlorine decay. The knowledge gained on chlorine decay would be useful for improving water treatment and network operating conditions so that appropriate chlorine residuals are maintained to protect the network from the risks of poor water quality that may occur due to the aforementioned problems.",
1767,"New insights into the structure of Om Ali-Thelepte basin, central Tunisia, inferred from gravity data: Hydrogeological implications This work presents new results from gravity data analyses and interpretation within the Om Ali-Thelepte (OAT) basin, central Tunisia. It focuses on the hydrogeological implication, using several qualitative and quantitative techniques such as horizontal gradient, upward continuation and Euler deconvolution on boreholes log data, seismic reflection data and electrical conductivity measurements. The structures highlighted using the filtering techniques suggest that the Miocene aquifer of OAT basin is cut by four major fault systems that trend E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE and NNE-SSW. In addition, a NW-SE gravity model established shows the geometry of the Miocene sandstone reservoir and the Upper Cretaceous limestone rocks. Moreover, the superimposition of the electrical conductivity and the structural maps indicates that the low conductivity values of sampled water from boreholes are located around main faults.

In some sampling points the uranium concentrations of drinking water, exceeded the WHO guideline level for drinking water.(1) Thus, the human effect of uranium exposure from drinking water in these areas is significant. However, soil samples were the same as in the Nature. Irrigation systems in these areas would be easy for water carried in the drains mix with groundwater. The results here suggest that the uranium passes into the groundwater through the agriculture land by the above mechanism.",
1769,"Chemical and microbiological risk assessment of urban river water quality in Vietnam The contamination and risk by nutrients (NH(4)(+), NO(2)(-), NO(3)(-) and PO(4)(3-)), COD, BOD(5), coliform and potentially toxic elements (PTEs)Â of As, Cd, Ni, Hg, Cu, Pb, Zn and Cr were investigated in urban river (Nhue River), Vietnam during 2010-2017. The extensive results demonstrated that concentrations of these contaminants showed significant spatial and temporal variations. The Nhue River was seriously polluted by NH(4)(+) (0.025-11.28Â mg/L), PO(4)(3-) (0.17-1.72Â mg/L), BOD(5) (5.8-179.6Â mg/L), COD (1.4-239.8Â mg/L) and coliform (1540-326,470Â CFU/100Â mL); moderately polluted by As (0.2-131.15Â Î¼g/L) and Hg (0.11-4.1Â Î¼g/L); and slightly polluted by NO(2)(-) (0.003-0.33Â mg/L) and Cd (2.1-18.2Â Î¼g/L). The concentrations of NH(4)(+), PO(4)(3-), COD, BOD(5) and coliform frequently exceeded both drinking water guidelines and irrigation water standards. Regarding PTEs, As, Cd and Hg concentrations were frequently higher than the regulatory limits. Human health risks of PTEs were evaluated by estimating hazard index (HI) and cancer risk through ingestion and dermal contacts for adults and children. The findings indicated that As was the most important pollutant causing both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic concerns. The non-carcinogenic risks of As were higher than 1.0 at all sites for both adults (HIÂ =Â 1.83-7.4) and children (HIÂ =Â 2.6-10.5), while As posed significant carcinogenic risks for adults (1Â Ã—Â 10(-4)-4.96â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-4)).

1770,"SHRIMP zircon U/Pb dating on ultrahigh pressure rocks from Yangkou: Implications for the timing of partial melting in the Sulu UHP metamorphic belt Fertile components in UHP rocks could undergo partial melting at both water-present or -absent conditions during deep subduction as well as early stages of rapid exhumation of continental materials. Petrographic and geochemical observations had shown that the Sulu UHP rocks experienced partial melting at UHP-HP conditions, which led to the formation of quartzo-feldspathic inclusions, granitic veins or plutons, and substantial geochemical effects. To further constrain the timing of these partial melting events, we have carried out SHRIMP zircon U/Pb dating on UHP metapelite as well as concordant K-rich granitic dike from Yangkou, Shandong Province. Zircon separates from boils samples have core-mantle-rim structure. Zircon cores from metapelite yield Pb-206/U-238 ages greater than 282Ma, which represents different crustal components incorporated into the protiolith of metapelite. The mantle and rim yield Pb-206/U-238 ages of 233 +/- 3Ma and 214 +/- 4Ma, representing the timing of UHP and amphibolite facies retrograde reactions, respectively. Zircon grains from the synkinematic peraluminous granitic dike ( A/CNK = 1. 2) yield similarly wide range Pb-206/U-238 ages (483 similar to 800Ma) from the core, implying that it might be derived from metasediments like sample SYK08-08. Except for one spot from the mantle yields Pb-206/U-238 age of 234. 6 +/- 3. 9Ma, all the other spots cluster around a concordant Pb-206/U-238 age of 220. 8 +/- 2. 9Ma. These mantle domains also contain mineral inclusions of Pl + Kfs + Qtz + Ap, typical of granitic composition. Such an association indicates that the Sulu UHP metasediments underwent partial melting at similar to 221Ma and prior to the widespread amphibolite facies retrograde metamorphism.",
1771,"Building multi-country collaboration on watershed management: lessons on linking environment and public health from the Western Balkans Community-based watershed resilience programs that bridge public health and environmental outcomes often require cross-boundary, multi-country collaboration. The CRESSIDA project, led by the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe (REC) and supported by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), forwards a resilience-focused approach for Western Balkan communities in the Drini and Drina river watersheds with the goal of safeguarding public health and the environment. The initial phases of this project give a contextualized example of how to advance resilience-driven environmental health goals in Western Balkan communities, and experience within the region has garnered several theme areas that require focus in order to promote a holistic watershed management program. In this paper, using CRESSIDA as a case study, we show (1) how watershed projects designed with resilience-driven environmental health goals can work in context, (2) provide data surrounding contextualized problems with resilience and suggest tools and strategies for the implementation of projects to address these problems, and (3) explore how cross-boundary foci are central to the success of these approaches in watersheds that comprise several countries.",
1772,"I-129 and I-127 transport in the Mississippi River The watershed processes which control I-129/I-127 ratios, I-129 and I-127 concentrations, and speciation of iodine isotopes were studied through an investigation into the variability of these parameters in the Mississippi River near New Orleans, undertaken in 1996-1998. Analyses of suspended particulate matter (SPM) revealed a greater percent association of I-127 than of I-129, resulting in lower I-129/I-127 ratios in SPM than in surrounding water. Furthermore, crossflow ultrafiltration showed that organo-iodine was the dominant form for both isotopes, with 70-85% of these isotopes found in the 0.45 mum filter-passing fraction associated with colloidal macromolecular organic matter, I-129 showed a weak correlation, I-127 no correlation, and I-129/I-127 ratios a strong inverse correlation with river flow rate. Inverse correlations between I-129/I-127 ratios and river flow rates can be best explained by rainwater and evapotranspiration dominated ratios at base flow and a lowering of the isotope ratios during higher flow due to extra inputs of I-127 from soil weathering. We postulate that different equilibration times for I-127 and I-129 as well as for bomb-produced I-129 and reprocessing-produced I-129 are responsible for these fractionation effects and the differential mobilities of these isotopes in the Mississippi River watershed.",
1773,"The impact of climate change on regional water balances in Bangladesh The probable effect of climate change on the water available for use in Bangladesh is not well known. We calculate monthly water balances for five main regions of Bangladesh to examine the likely impacts of climate change to 2050. We also examine the impact of past and potential future irrigation development. Climate change projections for rainfall in Bangladesh are uncertain, with increased rain in the wet season likely, but decreased rain also possible. Runoff is projected to vary in a manner similar to rainfall. However, assuming no change to the area of crops, all projections result in increases in irrigation water use, which leads to groundwater level declines. The impact of change (whether climate change or development) on water availability and use is greater in the Northwest region than elsewhere. For most water balance terms in most regions, irrigation development (both historic and future) is calculated to have a larger impact than climate change. Climate change is calculated to have a larger impact than irrigation development only on evapotranspiration and runoff, and possibly on groundwater levels. Model sensitivity tests suggest that model uncertainty is less than climate change uncertainty. To reverse lowered groundwater levels, Bangladesh's policy includes greater use of surface water. While we calculate groundwater levels will rise, the viability of the policy may be affected by future changes to upstream use.",
1774,"First report of Colletotrichum fructicola causing anthracnose on cherry (Prunus avium) in China Cherry (Prunus avium) has become an important economical fruit in China. In October 2020, a leaf spot disease was found on cherry in the orchard of Taizhou Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Zhejiang, China. The symptoms appeared as small, water-soaked spots on the leaves, which later became larger, dark brown, and necrotic lesions of 1 cm to 3 cm in width, 4 cm to 8 cm in length. Disease incidences of approximately 60% of the leaves were observed by sampling five locations. To isolate the causing agent, small fragments from five target symptomatic leaves were surface-sterilized with 1.0% sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 min and then rinsed three times with sterilized water. Afterwards the leaf fragments were air-dried, plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, and incubated at 25 â„ƒ in the dark for 2 days. The pure cultures were obtained by transferring hyphal plug of 2 mm in diameter onto PDA, which followed single spore isolation. The colony morphology showed light to dark gray, cottony mycelium, with the underside of the culture became brownish after 7 days. Conidia (n = 28) were hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, aseptate, broadly rounded ends, and average size around 3.84 Ã— 12.82 Î¼m (2.99 to 4.87 Ã— 10.27 to 15.68 Î¼m). Appressoria (n = 27) were mostly brown, ovoid and slightly irregular in shape, and average size around 8.04 Ã— 9.68 Î¼m (6.29 to 9.67 Ã— 9.32 to 12.06 Î¼m). Perithecia average size is 106.25 Î¼m, textura angularis, thick-walled. Asci 26.35-49.18 Ã— 5.00-12.03 Î¼m (average size 37.44 Ã— 7.80 Î¼m, n = 17), unitunicate, thin-walled, clavate or cymbiform. Ascospores 13.69-20.93 Ã— 3.86-6.69 Î¼m (average size 16.00 Ã— 5.42 Î¼m, n = 30), one-celled, hyaline, one or two large guttulate at the centre, slightly rounded ends. The morphological characteristics matched well with previous descriptions of Colletotrichum species of C. gloeosporioides species complex, including C. fructicola (Prihastuti et al. 2009; Fu et al. 2019). The identity of two representative isolates (cf2-3 and cf4-4) from different leaves was confirmed by means of multi-locus gene sequencing. To this end, genomic DNA was extracted by the Plant Direct PCR kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, China). Molecular identification was conducted by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region, partial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, partial actin (ACT) gene, partial beta-tubulin 2 gene (TUB2), and partial chitin synthase gene (CHS). The obtained sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MW581851 and MW581852 (ITS), MW590586 and MW590587 (GAPDH), MW616561 and MW616562 (ACT), MW729380 and MW729381 (TUB2), MW729378 and MW729379 (CHS). The results of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis revealed that the ITS, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2 and CHS sequences of both isolates matched with 100% identity to Colletotrichum fructicola culture collection sequences in GenBank database (JX010165, JX009998, JX009491, JX010405, and JX009866 respectively). These morphological characteristics and molecular analyses allowed the identification of the pathogen as C. fructicola. Koch's postulates were performed with healthy detached cherry leaves of cultivar namely 'HongMi' from Taizhou Academy of Agriculture Sciences. Surface-sterilized leaves were inoculated with five-day-old cultures of C. fructicola mycelial discs of 2 mm in diameter after being wounded with a needle or non-wounded. Control leaves were inoculated with discs of same size PDA agar. Treated leaves were incubated at 25 â„ƒ in the dark at high relative humidity. Anthracnose symptoms appeared within 3 days both on non-wounded and wounded inoculation approaches. Mock-inoculated controls remained asymptomatic. Biological repetitions were carried out three times. The fungus was reisolated from infected leaves and confirmed as C. fructicola following the methods described above. Until recently, it has been found that C. fructicola can infect tea, apple, pear, Pouteria campechiana in China (Fu et al. 2014; Li et al. 2013; Shi et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2020). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of C. fructicola on cherry in China.",
1775,"Why Land Here? Ports and Harbors in Southeast Tanzania in the Early Second Millennium AD The east African Swahili ports developed extensive maritime trading links around the Indian Ocean, and supported economic, political, and urban growth in the early second millennium AD. This article identifies ports of varying function and importance in SE Tanzania, and seeks to understand their development in the context of natural harbor advantage, boat technology, sailing practice, and resource needs. Field data from landing places are combined with weather patterns, historical documents, and oral traditions to provide an integrated survey of the ports and harbors that once sustained medieval commerce along this section of the Swahili coast. The emergence of Kilwa as an entrepot to become the key center is based initially upon its naturally advantageous harbor facilities, safety and flexibility of approach in days of sail, and assurance of monsoon winds. Original natural advantages gradually become self-sustaining with its economic and political growth. To the north and south of Kilwa a series of ports of call with drinking water and boat servicing supported trade to and from the pre-eminent city, although some such as Kisimani Mafia and Kwale-Kisuju developed important trade functions of their own.",

1777,"Field observation on secondary organic aerosols during Asian dust storm periods: Formation mechanism of oxalic acid and related compounds on dust surface Chemical evolution of East Asian dust during transpacific transport has been given much attention for inorganic species such as sulfate, nitrate and ammonium. However, the role of organic species during the transport has almost entirely been ignored. To understand the formation mechanism of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) on dust surfaces, this study investigated the concentrations and compositions of dicarboxylic acids, keto-carboxylic acids, alpha-dicarbonyls and inorganic ions in size-segregated aerosols (9-stages) collected in Xi'an, central China during the two dust storm episodes in the springs of 2009 and 2011 and compared with those in nondust storm periods. During the events the ambient particulate dicarboxylic acids were 932-2240 ng m(-3), which are comparable and even higher than those in nondust periods. Molecular compositions of the above SOA are similar to those in nondust periods with oxalic acid being the leading species. In the presence of the dust storms, all the above mentioned SOA species in Xi'an were predominantly enriched on the coarse particles (>2.1 mu m), and oxalic acid well correlated with NO3- (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.001) rather than SO42-. This phenomenon differs greatly from the SOA in any other nondust period that is usually characterized by an enrichment of oxalic acid in fine mode and a strong correlation of oxalic acid with SO42-. We propose a formation pathway to explain these observations, in which nitric acid and/or nitrogen oxides react with dust to produce Ca(NO3)(2) and form a liquid phase on the surface of dust aerosols via water vapor-absorption of Ca(NO3)(2), followed by a partitioning of the gas-phase water-soluble organic precursors (e.g.,glyoxal and methylglyoxal) into the aqueous-phase and a subsequent oxidation into oxalic acid. To the best of our knowledge, we found for the first time the enrichment of glyoxal and methylglyoxal on dust surface. Our data suggest an important role of nitrate in the heterogeneous formation process of SOA on the surface of dust. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1778,"Spatio-temporal pattern analysis of land use/cover change trajectories in Xihe watershed Human-induced land use/cover change has been considered to be one of the most important parts of global environmental changes. In loess hilly and gully regions, to prevent soil loss and achieve better ecological environments, soil conservation measures have been taken during the past decades. The main objective of this study is to quantify the spatio-temporal variability of land use/cover change spatial patterns and make preliminary estimation of the role of human activity in the environmental change in Xihe watershed, Gansu Province, China. To achieve this objective, the methodology was developed in two different aspects, that is, (1) analysis of change patterns by binary image of change trajectories overlaid with different natural geographic factors, in which Relative Change Intensity (RCI) metric was established and used to make comparisons, and (2) analysis based on pattern metrics of main trajectories in the study area. Multi-source and multi-temporal Remote Sensing (RS) images (including Landsat ETM+ (30 June 2001), SPOT imagery (21 November 2003 and 5 May 2008) and CBERS02 CCD (5 June 2006)) were used due to the constraints of the availability of remotely sensed data. First, they were used to extract land use/cover types of each time node by object-oriented classification method. Classification results were then utilized in the trajectory analysis of land use/cover changes through the given four time nodes. Trajectories at every pixel were acquired to trace the history of land use/cover change for every location in the study area. Landscape metrics of trajectories were then analyzed to detect the change characteristics in time and space through the given time series. Analysis showed that most land use/cover changes were caused by human activities, most of which, under the direction of local government, had mainly led to virtuous change on the ecological environments. While, on the contrary, about one quarter of human-induced changes were vicious ones. Analysis through overlaying binary image of change trajectories with natural factors can efficiently show the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of land use/cover change patterns. It is found that in the study area RCI of land use/cover changes is related to the distance to the river line. And there is a certain correlation between RCI and slope grades. However, no obvious correlation exists between RCI and aspect grades. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1779,"Application of a vegetative cover on phosphogypsum stacks The treatment of phosphates for the production of phosphoric acid and fertilisers at Navodari, Romania, has resulted in the production of over 3,000,000 m(3) of phosphogypsum, which have been disposed of in three stacks over an. area of 40 ha. An environmental characterisation study followed by a risk assessment analysis performed on a source-pathway-target basis has shown that phosphogypsum is characterised by residual acidity, elevated concentrations of sulphates, heavy metals and radionuclides and due to the lack of a vegetative cover aerial transportation of fine particles as well as solubilisation and migration of heavy and radioactive elements occurs contaminating surrounding soils, surface and ground waters. Therefore the application of a remediation scheme is considered necessary in order to prevent further contamination of the ecosystem in the area. The establishment of a vegetative cover on phosphogypsum stacks is considered as a viable option for the prevention of future environmental impacts. In this paper, the experimental work conducted in order to study the establishment of a vegetative cover on phosphogypsum stacks is presented and discussed. The major part of this work is focused on the study of glasshouse pot experiments testing a number of herbaceous species and bushes which show tolerance and a potential for growth in such environments. Modification of substrates, in order to increase soil pH, add nutrients in. the system and in general to provide the optimum growth characteristics for the species planted, was performed by mixing phosphogypsum tailings with several additives such as dolomite, kaolin, sewage sludge and clean soil in various modifications. Preliminary experimental data show that several perennial species and bushes tested show an excellent growth potential and can be used for the establishment of an in situ vegetative cover.

In Brazil, water quality is monitored only through physicochemical and microbiological parameters, and considering the biomarkers' importance in complementing the analysis, the present study was aimed at evaluating the environmental quality of the Estancia Velha stream also through cytogenotoxic criteria, at the stream source (site 1), as well as upstream (site 2) and downstream (site 3) of the demographically most dense area. The results for dissolved oxygen, color, total phosphorus, silver, and thermotolerant coliforms classified the Estancia Velha stream as class 4 in general; that is, the water is suitable only for navigation and to landscape harmony. Overall, the water was classified as poor by Water Quality Index (WQI) and as hypereutrophic by Trophic State Index (TSI). The main genotoxic alterations (micronuclei and nuclear buds) were observed in site 2, in which were obtained the highest levels of aluminum, silver, iron, and manganese. Despite this, most of the effluents released from the region are not treated prior to being discharged into the stream, suggesting the requirement for effluent treatment to ensure the quality of the water source available.",
1782,"Agronomic and economical characterizations of a two-harvest regime for oat forage in cold regions of Northern China The natural grasslands in northern China have been seriously degraded due mainly to overgrazing and climate change in recent decades, leading to shortage of forage supply to animal husbandry. To maximize forage production, we developed a two-harvest regime of oat forage by sowing in spring in an alpine region of Hulun Buir, northern China, using two oat early maturation species. The agronomic characteristics and forage quality of the two-harvest regime were evaluated across three constructive years from 2017 to 2019. Compared to the traditional one-harvest regime, the production, resource use efficiency, and economic benefits were compared and quantified for both oat species across the 3 years. Dry weight forage by the two-harvest regime was increased by 17.5-18.5%, while crude protein was increased by 25.1-30.0%. Growing days by the two-harvest regime was increased by 36.7% on average, nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency was enhanced by 25.1-30.0%, while water use efficiency was not significantly changed. The two-harvest regime also increased the net profit by 28.0%. Taken together, our results reveal that the two-harvest regime of forage production in the cold region of northern China is a promising practice with high forage yield, nutritional value, and nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency as well as economic profit.",
1783,"A Comparative Study on a Hydraulic and Water-Quality Analysis Method for Determining Rechlorination Injection Points for a Water-Supply Network Water supply facilities are vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods. To establish a sustainable solution that resists accidents and disasters, a distributed system is required. To supply high-quality tap water using the existing water-supply network, rechlorination facilities must be installed to secure residual chlorine at the pipe end. In this study, a process is developed to determine the injection points and dosages of rechlorination using the latest pressure-driven analysis. The method was compared to the results of demand driven analysis methods. The proposed model was applied to P City in Korea to draw results. A detailed evaluation was performed to study how water pressure head and demand-based hydraulic and water quality analysis results impact the injection points and dosages of rechlorination. Thus, the existing demand-based model shows significant spatial deviations in the pressure head in the presence of water pressure drops, which subsequently lead to over-estimation of chlorine injection dosages for maintaining the concentration of residual chlorine. However, the proposed model involves a numerically validated theory and draws more reasonable results for hydraulic, water quality, and rechlorination dosages. The proposed model can be used as a decision-making tool based on hydraulic analysis for the supply of water of a stable quality.",

After the pasteurization process for storing (150Ltrs of milk) in low tem- perature till its distribution, adsorption refrigeration is proposed here as it is run by solar/ waste heat or biogas (easily available from farm waste). During milk heating and storing at low temperature, materials used for containers and piping have chosen stainless steel (SS316), so that materials should not react with milk. For pasteurization of milk, one parabolic collector has been designed and developed. The result shows that at 5LPM flow rate, milk can be easily heated at 75 degrees C for 30 min. For storing 150ltrs of milk at 15-20 degrees C for 10-12 hrs, a solar power (flat plate collectors 8 m2) adsorption refrigeration has been designed and discussed. For adsorption refrigeration, selection of adsorption pair is very important. After reviewing different literatures, here activated carbon and methanol have chosen and justified. The experimental result shows that for 400LPH hot water supplied at 90 degrees C (desorber bed temperature at 80 degrees C), 35 degrees C condenser temperature and evaporator temperature 5 degrees C system's specific cooling power varies between 5.7 kW/kg to 5.4 kW/kg (variation due to uncertainty analysis) which is sufficient for storing 150ltrs of milk.

1785,"Biochar increased water holding capacity but accelerated organic carbon leaching from a sloping farmland soil in China A hydrologically contained field study, to assess biochar (produced from mixed crop straws) influence upon soil hydraulic properties and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching, was conducted on a loamy soil (entisol). The soil, noted for its low plant-available water and low soil organic matter, is the most important arable soil type in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River catchment, China. Pore size distribution characterization (by N2 adsorption, mercury intrusion, and water retention) showed that the biochar had a tri-modal pore size distribution. This included pores with diameters in the range of 0.1-10Â Î¼m that can retain plant-available water. Comparison of soil water retention curves between the control (0) and the biochar plots (16Â tÂ ha(-1) on dry weight basis) demonstrated biochar amendment to increase soil water holding capacity. However, significant increases in DOC concentration of soil pore water in both the plough layer and the undisturbed subsoil layer were observed in the biochar-amended plots. An increased loss of DOC relative to the control was observed upon rainfall events. Measurements of excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence indicated the DOC increment originated primarily from the organic carbon pool in the soil that became more soluble following biochar incorporation.",
1786,"Synthesis of Chitosan/Maleate-Alumoxane nanocomposite membranes for adsorption of anionic dye Chitosan/Mal-A nanocomposite membranes were synthesized and used for adsorption of Reactive Yellow 84 (RY 84) from aqueous solution. The membranes were prepared by solution-casting method with 2 wt% Chitosan (Cs) and various ratios of Mal-A (0.3-0.9 wt%). FTIR and SEM analyses were used to characterize the Cs-based membrane. The results showed that a dense-thin-face layer associated with an open-structure layer was formed in the composite membrane containing 0.5 wt% Mal-A. Membrane performance was investigated as dye removal and permeate flux. The significant effects of the operating variables including pH, initial concentration of dye, and Cs/Mal-A dose, were evaluated on RY removal efficiency using response surface methodology (RSM). The results obtained from the experimental data were presented with the quadratic regression model. The adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherm were well described by the pseudo-second order and the Langmuir model, respectively. Adding Mal-A nanoparticles to the Cs matrix (0.5wt%) improved liquid permeability by 21% compared with the Cs membrane, while dye removal efficiency for both membranes remained approximately 100% at acidic pH and under a trans-membrane pressure of 3 bar. The protonation of the amine groups in CS/Mal-A results in a positive charge on the membrane surface which causes a complete removal of the anionic dye. The permeability improvement of similar to 57.2% for the composite membrane was achieved at a pressure difference of 5 bar, which corresponded to an efficiency reduction of 10%.",
1787,"Identification of the hydrogeochemical processes and assessment of groundwater quality using classic integrated geochemical methods in the Southeastern part of Ordos basin, China Insufficient understanding of the hydrogeochemistry of aquifers makes it necessary to conduct a preliminary water quality assessment in the southern region of Ordos Basin, an arid area in the world. In this paper, the major ions of groundwater have been studied aiming at evaluating the hydrogeochemical processes that probably affect the groundwater quality using 150 samples collected in 2015. The two prevalent hydrochemical facies, HCO(3)MgÂ·NaÂ·Ca and HCO(3)MgÂ·CaÂ·Na type water, have been identified based on the hydrochemical analysis from Piper trilinear diagram. Compositional relations have been used to assess the origin of solutes and confirm the predominant hydrogeochemical processes responsible for the various ions in the groundwater. The results show that the ions are derived from leaching effect, evaporation and condensation, cation exchange, mixing effect and human activities. Finally groundwater quality was assessed with single factor and set pair methods, the results indicate that groundwater quality in the study region is generally poor in terms of standard of national groundwater quality. The results obtained in this study will be useful to understand the groundwater quality status for effective management and utilization of the groundwater resource.",
1788,"How Water, Carbon, and Energy Drive Critical Zone Evolution: The Jemez-Santa Catalina Critical Zone Observatory The structure of the critical zone (CZ) is a result of tectonic, lithogenic, and climatic forcings that shape the landscape across geologic time scales. The CZ structure can be probed to measure contemporary rates of regolith production and hillslope evolution, and its fluids and solids can be sampled to determine how structure affects CZ function as a living filter for hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding how variability in climate and lithology influence CZ structure and function across both short (e. g., hydrologic event) and long (e. g., landscape evolution) time scales. We are addressing this issue using a theoretical framework that quantifies system inputs in terms of environmental energy and mass transfer (EEMT, MJ m(-2) yr(-1)) in the recently established Jemez River Basin (JRB)-Santa Catalina Mountains (SCM) Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). We postulate that C and water fluxes, as embodied in EEMT, drive CZ evolution and that quantifying system inputs in this way leads to predictions of nonlinear and threshold effects in CZ structure formation. We are testing this hypothesis in the JRB-SCM CZO, which comprises a pair of observatories-in northern New Mexico within the Rio Grande basin (JRB) and in southern Arizona within the Colorado River basin (SCM). The JRB-SCM CZO spans gradients in climate, lithology, and biota representative of much variation found in the larger U. S Southwest. Our approach includes in situ monitoring of zero-order basins nested within larger CZO watersheds and measurement-modeling iterations. The initial data collected at the ecosystem, pedon, and catchment scales indicates a strong role of coupled C and water flux in regulating chemical denudation of catchments in the JRB site.",
1789,"Potential for domestic biogas as household energy supply in South Africa Biogas is a clean and renewable form of energy accessible to low-income households through anaerobic digestion of readily available organic waste. The objectives of this desktop study were to investigate the feasibility of biogas use for substitution of presently used solid fuels in rural and periurban households, the subsequent health co-benefits, and the constraints to adoption of domestic biogas technology in South Africa. The energy demand of low-income South African households for cooking with fuelwood was found to be 27 MJ/day and the total energy demand 68 MJ/day. This is equivalent to 2 500 L/day/household of biogas for cooking and 6 250 L/day/household of biogas for complete substitution of conventional domestic fuels. Complete substitution of fuelwood used for cooking and household fuelwood use with biogas can result in the avoidance of 43% and 85.4% respectively of total disability adjusted life-years lost (702 790) and mortalities (22 365) from indoor smoke as a consequence of solid fuel use. Approximately 625 000 households in South Africa can potentially benefit from bio-digester fed with cattle and pig waste, on the basis of livestock numbers. It is infeasible to operate a domestic bio-digester fed solely with human waste, chicken waste and food waste because of insufficient feedstock. Non-sewered households with access to on-and off-site water supply generate sufficient greywater for feeding a domestic bio-digester for cooking purposes. This is, therefore, recommended over the use of drinking water.",
1790,"SIMULATION OF FLOW AND TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN UNDERGROUND COAL MINES WITH POROUS FLUID DYNAMICS Flow and temperature distribution in underground coal mines leading to significant attention is not just because miners require suitable environment for labor works but more importantly the task to prevent thermal hazard from coal oxidation. If heat generated by low-temperature oxidation and geothermal source is not adequately dissipated, it results in net temperature increase in coal mass and may ignite combustion of burnable gases and even explosion. The extremely prone region for thermal hazard is coal mine gobs, which are in fact porous media composed by uncollected coal and collapsed rock fragments after mining. Air leakage from the tunnel-like working face into gobs on one hand dilutes the combustible gases but on the other hand also accelerates oxidation with continuous supply of oxygen. It is therefore very critical to understand flow and temperature distribution in coal mine gobs so it can assist to optimize ventilation to prevent thermal hazard. However, the inaccessible nature and possible collapse in gobs makes in situ measurement of thermal conditions nearly infeasible, so numerical modeling remains a very attractive option. Based on the volumetric average method of thermo-fluid theories in porous media, this investigation develops a new two-dimensional model for flow and temperature distribution in both mining faces (similar to tunnels) and gobs, by applying a vorticity-stream function approach. Since gob flows are mixed types with laminar, turbulent, and transient flows, the Brinkman-Forchheimer-exteiided Darcy model is incorporated into the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations to approximate the contribution of viscous forces. Temperature distribution in gobs is highly dependent on coal oxidation and however temperature determines coal oxidation rate, so governing equations of energy and oxygen content are coupled and solved simultaneously. The numerical model was first tested for a natural convection flow in a two-dimensional enclosure with boundary conditions well prescribed in lab and then applied to simulate a typical U-type gob in China. The model is found being capable to provide flow, oxygen and temperature distribution in good agreement with measurement data. The simulation results reveal that an asymmetric airflow distribution is formed in them gob and high temperature gradients are mainly concentrated to the regions right behind the working face. The most risky location for thermal hazard is on the mid-line of the gob away from the working face with tens of meters. Such spot should be drawn full attention for possible spontaneous combustion to assure mine safety.",
1791,"Arsenic-contaminated groundwater and its potential health risk: A case study in Long An and Tien Giang provinces of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam The occurrence of arsenic (As) in groundwater (drilled well water) that were used for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene and its risks to human health in Long An and Tien Giang provinces (Mekong delta, Vietnam) were evaluated in this study. The average As concentrations were 15.92 +/- 11.4 mu g/L (n = 24, Long An) and 4.95 +/- 4.7 mu g/L (n = 24, Tien Giang). The average concentrations of As in Long An had not reached the WHO and QCVN 01: 2009/BYT healthy drinking water standard (10 mu g/L). When used as a source of water for drinking and daily activities, arsenic-contaminated groundwater may have a direct impact on human health. The risk assessment from groundwater established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) was conducted. The risk assessment showed that the average cancer risk (CR) values were 8.68 x 10(-4)(adults) and 2.39 x 10(-3)(children) for Long An, and 2.70 x 10(-4)(adults) and 7.43 x 10(-4)(children) for Tien Giang. These results were significantly higher than the CR (1 x 10(-4)) proposed by the USEPA. The adverse health effect was therefore specifically warned by the use of arsenic-contaminated groundwater. This research offers valuable knowledge for efficient water management approaches to guarantee local communities' health protection.",
1792,"Interannual Variation in Carbon Sequestration Depends Mainly on the Carbon Uptake Period in Two Croplands on the North China Plain Interannual variation in plant phenology can lead to major modifications in the interannual variation of net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome production (NBP) as a result of recent climate change in croplands. Continuous measurements of carbon flux using the eddy covariance technique were conducted in two winter wheat and summer maize double-cropped croplands during 2003-2012 in Yucheng and during 2007-2012 in Luancheng on the North China Plain. Our results showed that the difference between the NEP and the NBP, i.e., the crop economic yield, was conservative even though the NEP and the NBP for both sites exhibited marked fluctuations during the years of observation. A significant and positive relationship was found between the annual carbon uptake period (CUP) and the NEP as well as the NBP. The NEP and the NBP would increase by 14.8 +/- 5.2 and 14.7 +/- 6.6 g C m(-2) 22 yr(-1), respectively, if one CUP-day was extended. A positive relationship also existed between the CUP and the NEP as well as the NBP for winter wheat and summer maize, respectively. The annual air temperature, through its negative effect on the start date of the CUP, determined the length of the CUP. The spring temperature was the main indirect factor controlling the annual carbon sequestration when a one-season crop (winter wheat) was considered. Thus, global warming can be expected to extend the length of the CUP and thus increase carbon sequestration in croplands.",
1793,"Rock magnetic study of basic intrusions and massive sulphides in the Hercynian central Jebilets Massif (Occidental-Meseta), Morocco This paper describes a multidisciplinary study approach (petrography and rock magnetism) conducted on samples collected from the study area to characterise the magnetic mineralogy and to determine if the magnetisation of both lithologies were induced or retain a remnant component. Petrophysical, mineralogical and geochemical analyses confirm bimodal aspects, particularly in basic rocks; the two magnetic modes depend essentially on the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the samples. The ultramafic rocks comprise a highly altered primary mineralogy with chromite and magnetite as magnetic phases. The second type is of mafic composition with a less altered primary mineralogy and essentially magnetite and/or (hemo-ilmenite) as a carrier of magnetic mineralisation. Sulphides are characterised by high concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb. The mineralogy is composed mainly of pyrrhotite (85% to 90%), sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and, occasionally, stannite. Monocline pyrrhotite seems to be the magnetic carrier of magnetisation in both Draa Sfar and Koudiat A < cha. However, we suspect a different amount of hexagonal pyrrhotite as the cause of different magnetic behaviour. Paleomagnetic and thermomagnetic analyses reveal different. The calculated characteristic direction of natural remnant magnetisation for sulphides was used to model the magnetic anomaly of Draa Sfar. The proposed model match the geological features concluded from geological mapping and boreholes. Results from this work can be very useful for any modelling processes of magnetic anomalies suspected due to a sulphide mineralisation in an area with poor outcrops and no presence of boreholes information or of any geological or geochemical data.",

1795,"Salinity reduction in groundwater by floodwater spreading Shortage of fresh water is the main limiting factor in the development of the Gareh Bygone Plain (GBP), 200 ion to the SE of Shiraz, Iran. Floodwater spreading for artificial recharge of groundwater (ARG) in the GBP has substantially increased the volume and noticeably reduced the salt content of the reserves. Over pumping during the drought of 1992-93 resulted in an alarming salinization of groundwater, while the ARG of 1993-94 reversed the trend. This, along with a concentric increase in the electrical conductivity (EC) of well water is an indication that ARG enhances water quality as it simultaneously increased its volume in the aquifer. The EC ranges from 1.261 dsm(-1) in the center of GBP-ARG systems to 11.640 dsm(-1), about 5 km from it.",
1796,"Drinking water treatment for a rural karst region in Indonesia An interdisciplinary German-Indonesian joint research project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) focused on the development and exemplary implementation of adapted technologies to improve the water supply situation in a model karst region in southern Java. The project involving 19 sub-projects covers exploration of water resources, water extraction, distribution as well as water quality assurance, and waste water treatment. For the water quality assurance, an appropriate and sustainable drinking water treatment concept was developed and exemplarily implemented. Monitoring results showed that the main quality issue was the contamination with hygienically relevant bacteria. Based on the gained results, a water treatment concept was developed consisting of a central sand filtration prior to the distribution network, a semi-central hygienization where large water volumes are needed to remove bacteria deriving from water distribution and a final point-of-use water treatment. This paper focuses on the development of a central sand filtration plant and some first analysis for the development of a recipe for the local production of ceramic filters for household water treatment. The first results show that arsenic and manganese are leaching from the filters made of local raw material. Though discarding the first, filtrates should be sufficient to reduce arsenic and manganese concentration effectively. Moreover, hydraulic conductivities of filter pots made of 40 % pore-forming agents are presented and discussed.",
1797,"Arsenic exposure to dairy cows in Bangladesh Food-chain contamination by arsenic (As) is a newly uncovered disaster. Effects of As-contaminated drinking water and paddy straw on the excretion of As through milk, urine, and dung of dairy cows (n = 240) were studied in As-prone areas of Bangladesh. Mean (Â±SEM) total As (inorganic plus organic) concentration in drinking water, paddy straw [dry weight dw)], cow's urine (specific gravity adjusted to 1.035), dung (dw), and milk (wet weight) were 89.6 Â± 6.5 Î¼g/l, 1,114.4 Â± 57.3 Î¼g/kg, 123.6 Â± 7.6 Î¼g/l, 1,693.0 Â± 65.1 Î¼g/kg, and 26.2 Â± 2.8 Î¼g/l, respectively. Significantly (p < 0.01) greater As was in Boro straw (1,386.9 Â± 71.8 Î¼g/kg) than Aus (702.4 Â± 67.1 Î¼g/kg) and Aman (431.7 Â± 28.8 Î¼g/kg) straw and in straw irrigated with shallow (1,697.3 Â± 81.9 Î¼g/kg) than deep well water (583.6 Â± 62.7 Î¼g/kg) and surface water (511.8 Â± 30.0 Î¼g/kg). Significant (p < 0.01) positive correlations were found between As contents of cow's urine and drinking water (r = 0.92) as well as cow dung and straw (r = 0.82). Concentrations of As in cow urine, dung, and milk were increased with the relative increment of As in drinking water and/or straw. These results provide evidence that dairy cows excrete ingested As mainly through urine and dung; thus, As biotransformation through milk remains low. This low concentration of As in milk may be of concern when humans are exposed to multiple sources of As simultaneously. Moreover, As in cow dung could be an environmental issue in Bangladesh.",
1798,"Community Level Planning for Arsenic Contaminated Drinking Water in Bangladesh In Bangladesh, arsenic contaminated drinking water has become a serious problem. Since the revelation of arsenic contamination, various water supply options have been installed to supply drinking water. However, some of them have already been abandoned. These options are not acceptable for local residents without consideration of their social environments and support after introduction. Purpose of this chapter aims to plan acceptable processes to install water supply options for the disaster of arsenic contaminated drinking water considering local social environment in Bangladesh.",
1799,"Effects of Landscape Pattern Change on Water Yield and Nonpoint Source Pollution in the Hun-Taizi River Watershed, China Understanding the influence of landscape pattern changes on water yield (WYLD) and nutrient yield is a key topic for water resource management and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution reduction. The annual WYLD and NPS pollution were estimated in 2004 and 2015 with the calibrated and validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the Hun-Taizi River watershed. The impact of land use and landscape pattern changes on the annual WYLD and NPS loading changes were analyzed with a boosted regression tree (BRT) and redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that WYLD had a positive correlation with dry farmland and built-up area; however, a negative correlation with paddy field and water area, with the relative contribution of 42.03%, 23.79%, 17.06%, and 13.55%, respectively. The change in nutrient yield was positively correlated with changes in dry farmland, built-up area, and water area but negatively with forestland, according to the BRT model. Landscape patterns had an important influence on WYLD and NPS pollution. A large unfragmented forestland may improve water quality, while a large concentrated dry farmland results in water quality deterioration due to NPS pollution. Water quality is more likely degraded when land uses are complex and scattered with many small patches in a forestland dominated watershed.",
1800,"Determination of monoaromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) in surface waters from a Brazilian subtropical hydrographic basin This study examined surface water samples for the presence of the monoaromatic hydrocarbons benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene. Water samples were collected from the sub-basin of the Tegas River and the Marrecas Stream microbasin located in the metropolitan region of the municipality of Caxias do Sul (Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil). For all sampling points evaluated, only toluene was detected, with concentrations values in the range of 1.70-18.44 Î¼g L(-1). In general, the relatively high toluene concentration for the samples collected were above the limit of 2 Î¼g L(-1) established by the Brazilian government for Class I rivers for the protection of aquatic life. However, they were well below the established limit of 170 Î¼g L(-1) in water used for human consumption.",
1801,"Water quality management and sustainability: the experience of Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) - Tanzania Human health and development are threatened in many parts. of the world either from lack of water or poor water quality. Human development has partially contributed to water quality deterioration. In Tanzania, for instance, rapid population growth that caused expansion of agricultural activities, livestock keeping, deforestation, biomass burning and human settlement have exerted pressures within the Lake Victoria Basin. These developments have led to land degradation and increased levels of pollution mainly from non-point sources. The Governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda initiated the program of Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project, (LVEMP), in 1994 to rehabilitate the Lake Ecosystem through restoration and conservation of biodiversity in the lake as well as within the catchment. This paper presents the five years (1997-2002) experience of LVEMP in Tanzania on the issues of water quality; focusing on water pollution, water quality monitoring and LVEMP strategies to accomplish water quality management in the Lake Zone (Kagera, Mara and Mwanza regions). The findings show that non-point source pollution from agricultural practices; as well as unplanned urban settlements contribute more to siltation and eutrophication of the of Lake Victoria than that from point source pollution. Recommendations for water quality management and sustainability are presented. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",
1802,"Paths to convergence of interests in depollution of the Guandu River in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In January 2020, the population of Greater Metropolitan Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, suffered deterioration in the quality of the public water supply, caused by the presence of geosmin, which compromised the water treatment process at the Guandu Water Treatment Plant, the only water source in the region. The phenomenon results from lack of investment in sewage infrastructure in the Guandu River Basin, which previously affected only the predominantly low-income population. The article aims to identify different social actors' roles and actions, using the Systemic Integration methodology, to allow convergence of their interests for prioritizing and achieving depollution of the Guandu River. Two distinct groups were identified: those who need to collaborate to achieve success with the initiative, consisting of planning, operations, and inspection agencies, and actors capable of politically leveraging and enabling the initiative, namely influential social, political, economic, and media sectors. In conclusion, the water supply crisis may recur seasonally if nothing is done and may thus be the element capable of leading to a convergence of interests among influential sectors for investment in sewage infrastructure to reverse the river basin's degradation, a requirement to solve the water crisis in Rio de Janeiro.",

Increase in land without shrub and permanent uncultivated (fallow) land, and reduction in coverages of the agricultural land and forest over the last four decades reflected the intensities of water scarcity caused from global warming as well as the agriculture related anthropogenic activities. Enhanced aridity led to 136-fold surge (ca. 2.5-340 km(2)) in abandonment of cultivated areas covering almost half of the basin. Absence of cropland in 2010 CE reflected the severe drought of early 21st Century but augmentation in usages of groundwater reestablished the agriculture a decade later in ca.15.7 km(2). Over the last four decades, the subsurface fire from combustion of peat covered ca.17.4 km(2) mostly at expenses of lands with and without shrub and agriculture land. Our temporal and spatial land use/land cover assessments might be helpful for private and government agencies to evaluate the short-term impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities in order to mitigate their effects in this water scarce region.",
1804,"Influence of chemical structure of dyes, of pH and of inorganic salts on their photocatalytic degradation by TiO2 comparison of the efficiency of powder and supported TiO2 Anionic (Alizarin S (AS), azo-Methyl Red (MR), Congo Red (CR), Orange G (OG)) and cationic (Methylene Blue (MB)) dyes were degraded, either individually or in mixtures, by using UV-irradiated TiO2) in suspension or supported on glass and on paper. The influence of the chemical structure of different dyes as well as that of pH and of the presence of inorganic salts on the photocatalytic properties of TiO2, has been discussed. The role of adsorption is suggested, indicating that the reaction occurs at the TiO2 surface and not in the solution. S and N hetero-atoms are respectively mineralized into SO42-, NO3- and NH4+, except azo-groups which mainly formed N-2 which represents an ideal case for a decontamination reaction. The fate of nitrogen strongly depends on its initial oxidation degree. High photocatalytic activities have been found for TiO2 coated on glass by the sol-gel method. Its efficiency was intermediate between those of PC-500 and P-25 powders. The efficiency of PC-500 TiO2 sample, fixed on paper by using a binder, is slightly less important than that of the powder. The presence of a silica-binder with an acidic pzc is suggested to be at the origin of the decrease in efficiency. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
1805,"International standards for services activities relating to drinking water supply systems and wastewater systems: implications for developing countries In developing countries, the PPP (Public-Private-Partnerships) programs have been unsatisfied during the last decade. This study analyzed one of the main causes is low quality of the system. That is, no matter what supports developing countries may get through PPP, reforming water systems can be hardly successful without appropriate system quality. With this background, this study introduces service standards of ISO/TC 224 as an option to improve system quality of developing countries. To analyze its effects, system dynamic modeling was conducted. The results indicated that service standards, working with the PPP programs, can benefit all the stakeholders involved in the water systems in developing countries. Also this indicates further that this approach with service standards deserves more detailed study for improving the ailing water systems in developing countries.",
1806,"The role of arsenic-bearing rocks in groundwater pollution at Zimapan Valley, Mexico Interaction of groundwater with As-bearing rocks has been proposed as one of three main sources of arsenic at Zimapan valley, Mexico. The complexity of the geology and hydrogeology of the valley make it difficult to identify the natural causes of arsenic poisoning. Samples from the different rock outcrops and water from wells tapping various rock formations were analyzed. The rocks from mineralized areas contained higher concentrations of arsenic with respect to the same formations in non-mineralized areas. The arsenic minerals arsenopyrite, scorodite, and tennantite were identified in some rock samples. Higher temperature and lower Eh values were found for those wells containing more arsenic. The physicochemical characteristics of these naturally polluted well waters could be produced by arsenopyrite oxidation. The geochemical model PHREEQCI was used to perform the inverse modeling of two wells located along the same fault. Arsenopyrite oxidation and scorodite dissolution appear to be the geochemical processes producing the natural pollution according to the model. The release and transport of arsenic mainly occur through fractures within the cretaceous limestones where the most productive wells are drilled. The presence of arsenic should be expected also in other formations near mineralized zones in the Zimapan Valley. Field determinations of Eh and T could be used to detect potentially polluted wells.",
1807,"Eutrophication Processes in Arid Climates Eutrophication is the process by which a water body becomes increasingly rich in aquatic plant life such as algae and aquatic macrophytes (water weeds). Eutrophication is characterized by the presence of sufficient plankton, algae, and water weeds, which cause water quality impairments for domestic water supply such as tastes and odors, shortened filter runs, THM precursor's formation. Lakes are often classified according to their trophy or degree of enrichment with nutrients and organic matter. They are classified by their trophic state with the main classes of oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and dystrophic. The main cause of eutrophication is the large input of nutrients to a water body and the main effect is the imbalance in the food web that results in high levels of phytoplankton microalgae, with a silicon skeleton (diatom) biomass in stratified water bodies which can lead to algal blooms. King Abdullah Canal is the main surface water source of potable and agricultural water supply in Jordan. Two main problems seem to face the use of KAC for domestic and agricultural purposes. These problems are eutrophication and formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons during water treatment. Both problems develop as direct or indirect results of anthropogenic activities.",
1808,"Emergency response and medical rescue in the worst hit Mianyang areas after the Wenchuan earthquake The 12 May 2008 earthquake caused damage to 88% of the health systems in the worst hit areas of Mianyang with 326 casualties and the direct economic loss of RMB 3124 billion. Within 30 minutes of the earthquake, the Mianyang headquarters for earthquake disaster relief and the Mianyang public health headquarters for medical rescue and treatment were organized. Five medical teams were sent to Beichuang County, the worst hit Mianyang area, four hours after the earthquake. A total of 22,947 wounded and sick people were delivered to local hospitals after simple triage and rapid treatment through three stations. By 30 June, the Mianyang medical organization had received 379,600 people and admitted 21,628 inpatients. These 2772 severely wounded (including 146 with limbs amputated and 846 who died in hospital). Since 17 May, 3381 wounded had been transferred to 14 provincial and city-level hospitals across China. On 20 June, the Mianyang Rehabilitation Center for wounded and sick people was established and received 156 rehabilitation inpatients. Together with the medical team for psychological intervention, they provided psychological support for over 70,000 people. Within two hours of the earthquake, the Mianyang Organization for Health and Epidemic Control and Prevention launched the emergency response plan for major natural disasters. The organization sent emergency teams for disease prevention and control and completed disinfection and burial of corpses and disposal of carcasses, monitoring of water quality and epidemics, disinfection of environmental ruins, epidemic control in resettled areas, precautions against secondary disasters caused by the earthquake, and large-scale health education. The emergency command system for medical rescue and disease control and prevention in the Mianyang areas integrated resources, carried out unified command, and responded rapidly. Furthermore, the headquarters of medical relief co-ordinated and united the governmental and nongovernmental organizations, achieving good performance for both medical relief and epidemic control. This experience of earthquake medical relief will benefit post-disaster reconstruction, as well as the establishment of national and regional emergency response systems.",
1809,"Groundwater Arsenic-Attributable Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Mortality Risks in India Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been recognized as the most serious non-carcinogenic detrimental health outcome arising from chronic exposure to arsenic. Drinking arsenic contaminated groundwaters is a critical and common exposure pathway for arsenic, notably in India and other countries in the circum-Himalayan region. Notwithstanding this, there has hitherto been a dearth of data on the likely impacts of this exposure on CVD in India. In this study, CVD mortality risks arising from drinking groundwater with high arsenic (>10 mu g/L) in India and its constituent states, territories, and districts were quantified using the population-attributable fraction (PAF) approach. Using a novel pseudo-contouring approach, we estimate that between 58 and 64 million people are exposed to arsenic exceeding 10 mu g/L in groundwater-derived drinking water in India. On an all-India basis, we estimate that 0.3-0.6% of CVD mortality is attributable to exposure to high arsenic groundwaters, corresponding to annual avoidable premature CVD-related deaths attributable to chronic exposure to groundwater arsenic in India of between around 6500 and 13,000. Based on the reported reduction in life of 12 to 28 years per death due to heart disease, we calculate value of statistical life (VSL) based annual costs to India of arsenic-attributable CVD mortality of between USD 750 million and USD 3400 million.",
1810,"Oxidized, magnetite-series, rapakivi-type granites of Carajas, Brazil: Implications for classification and petrogenesis of A-type granites The varying geochemical and petrogenetic nature of A-type granites is a controversial issue. The oxidized, magnetite-series A-type granites, defined by Anderson and Bender [Anderson, J.L., Bender, E.E., 1989. Nature and origin of Proterozoic A-type granitic magmatism in the southwestern United States of America. Lithos 23, 19-52.], are the most problematic as they do not strictly follow the original definition of A-type granites, and approach calc-alkalineand I-type granites in some aspects. The oxidized Jamon suite A-type granites of the Carajas province of the Amazonian craton are compared with the magnetite-series granites of Laurentia, and other representative A-type granites, including Finnish rapakivi and Lachlan Fold Belt A-type granites, as well as with calc-alkaline, I-type orogenic granites. The geochemistry and petrogenesis of different groups of A-types granites are discussed with an emphasis on oxidized A-type granites in order to define their geochemical signatures and to clarify the processes involved in their petrogenesis. Oxidized A-type granites are clearly distinguished from calc-alkaline Cordilleran granites not only regarding trace element composition, as previously demonstrated, but also in their major element geochemistry. Oxidized A-type granites have high whole-rock FeOt(FeO(t)t + MgO), TiO2/MgO, and k(2)O/Na2O and low Al2O3 and CaO compared to calc-alkaline granites. The contrast of Al2O3 contents in these two granite groups is remarkable. The CaO/(FeOt + MgO + TiO2) vs. CaO + Al2O3 and CaO/(FeOt + MgO + TiO2) vs. Al2O3 diagrams are proposed to distinguish A-type and calc-alkaline granites. Whole-rock FeOt(FeOt+MgO) and the FeOt(FeOt+MgO) vs. Al2O3 and FeOt/(FeOt+MgO) vs. Al2O3/(K2ONa2O) diagrams are suggested for discrimination of oxidized and reduced A-type granites. Experimental data indicate that, besides pressure, the nature of A-type granites is dependent of fO(2) conditions and the water content of magma sources. Oxidized A-type magmas are considered to be derived from melts with appreciable water contents (>= 4 wt.%), originating from lower crustal quartz-feldspathic igneous sources under oxidizing conditions, and which had clinopyroxene as an important residual phase. Reduced A-type granites may be derived from quartz-feldspathic igneous sources with a metasedimentary component or, alternatively, from differentiated tholeiitic sources. The imprint of the different magma sources is largely responsible for the geochemical and petrological contrasts between distinct A-type granite groups. Assunting conditions near the NNO buffer as a minimum for oxidized granites, magnetite-bearing granites formed near FMQ buffer conditions are not stricto sensu oxidized granites and a correspondence between oxidized and reduced A-type granites and, respectively, mangetite-series and itmenite-seties granites is not always observed.

1811,"Landfill site requirements on the rock environment: A case study The objectives of the study are to improve the standard of waste disposal and to provide guidelines for an environmentally acceptable waste disposal strategy in the biggest city of the eastern Black Sea region (NE Turkey). The requirements for waste disposal by landfill were investigated in three important stages: site selection (SS), engineering geological investigation (EGI) and finally site evaluation (SE). Because one of the serious and increasing potential problems in the growing urban regions is the shortage of land for waste disposal, the candidate sites for an appropriate landfill area in the major city of the region were determined by using the integration of spatial and multi-criteria decision analysis based methodology. Due to the fact that the main issue in this investigation is description of engineering suitability of the rock masses exposed at the proposed landfill site, the rock properties to be required for landfill construction and design were identified as a priority, and finally drainage and filtration materials, leachate collector system, covering and gas venting system were proposed. For these purposes, the borehole applications, in-situ and laboratory tests, scan-line and seismic surveys were conducted to characterize the engineering properties of the rock masses exposed at the proposed landfill site, and the Lugeon tests were applied to determine bedrock permeability. The methodology defined in the study proves to be an appropriate method for site selection, design and construction process in sustainable solid waste management program for other growing urban regions in the country.

1812,"Treatment of cold rolling mill (CRM) effluent of steel industry The study establishes the performance of standalone ozonation and electrocoagulation processes for the treatment of Cold Rolling Mill (CRM) effluent consisting of phenol, COD, BOD, iron, and oil content from the Tata Steel Industry, India. The operational variables of both the standalone processes, viz. current density (electrocoagulation), ozone generation rate (ozonation), and treatment time, were addressed to analyse its effect on the removal efficiency of each process separately. Optimum experimental conditions of 200 A m(-2) (current density), 1.12 mg s(-1) (ozone generation rate), and 30 min (treatment time) were adequate in lowering the amount of pollutant content below its respective discharge limits. However, it was observed that, standalone electrocoagulation process proved to be more efficient compared to ozonation, both in terms of economy and pollutant reduction efficiency for the targeted effluent. Also, the cost of ozonation process was found to be about six times than that of electrocoagulation. The kinetic study conducted showed that pseudo-first-order reaction fitted best with the highest R-2 of 0.99 for phenol, COD, BOD, iron, and 0.98 for oil. Moreover, mass transfer analysis for ozonation indicates an increase in the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (Kla) with an increase in the ozone generation rate. The efficiencies and operating costs for both the standalone processes were found to be satisfactory compared to that of other methods reported in the literature.",
1813,"Ecological intensification of cropping systems enhances soil functions, mitigates soil erosion, and promotes crop resilience to dry spells in the Brazilian Cerrado Water scarcity threatens global food security and agricultural systems are challenged to achieve high yields while optimizing water usage. Water deficit can be accentuated by soil physical degradation, which also triggers water losses through runoff and consequently soil erosion. Although soil health in cropping systems within the Brazilian Cerrado biome have been surveyed throughout the years, information about soil erosion impacts and its mitigation are still not well understood; especially concerning the role of cropping system diversification and its effects on crop yield. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether ecological intensification of cropping systems -inclusion of a consorted perennial grass and crop rotation- could promote soil coverage and consequently decrease water erosion and soil, water, and nutrient losses. This work studied the effects of crop rotation and consorted Brachiaria, along with different levels of investment in fertilization on soil physical quality and on soil, water, and nutrient losses, and crop yields. Results proved that soybean monoculture (SS) is a system of low sustainability even under no-till in the Brazilian Cerrado conditions. It exhibited high susceptibility to soil, water, and nutrient losses, causing low crop yields. Our results showed that water losses in SS cropping system were approximately 10% of the total annual rainfall, and total K losses would require an additional 35% of K application. Conversely, ecological intensification of cropping systems resulted in enhanced soil environmental and agronomic functions, increased grain yield, and promoted soil and water conservation: high soil cover rate, and low soil, water and nutrient losses. Ecological intensification proved to be an adequate practice to boost crop resilience to water deficit in the Brazilian Cerrado.

1814,"Health-risk assessment related to the fluoride, nitrate, and nitrite in the drinking water in the Sanandaj, Kurdistan County, Iran The concentration of fluoride and nitrate in groundwater is usually higher than that of surface water. The main objective of this study was to estimate the health-risk assessment associated with fluoride, nitrate, and nitrite in drinking water in Sanandaj and its villages. The number of samples in the Sanandaj and its rural was 106. The average concentration of fluoride in urban and rural drinking water was 0.22 mg/l and 0.27 mg/l, respectively. Fluoride concentration was also close to urban and rural drinking water. The concentration of nitrate in urban and rural drinking water was in the range between 0.28-27.77 mg/l and 1.28-80 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of nitrate reported in rural samples was higher than that of urban samples. The maximum concentration of nitrate reported in this study was 80 mg/l. The mean CDI for nitrate in the men, women, and children was 0.4258, 0.5110, and 1.1454, respectively. The findings of this study indicated that all three groups studied were exposed to nitrate contact hazards (HQ > 1). Therefore, the HQ in each of the three groups was higher than 1, which should be carefully monitored and necessary measures should be performed.",
1815,"MIGRATION OF IRON, ALUMINIUM, CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM AND SILICON FROM CERAMIC MATERIALS INTO FOOD SIMULANT Ceramics are widely used as kitchen ware. Pottery in contact with food can be a source of various compounds from clay and glazing. The potential migration of toxic lead and cadmium from ceramic is well-known and is evaluated by the specific maximum migration levels (acceptable limits being set by the Food Contact Materials Regulation (EC) 1935/2004). Besides lead and cadmium other elements have been detected in glazed ceramic ware that could migrate during food processing. Migration experiments were performed on 10 commercially available glazed and unglazed stewing potteries (produced in Latvia and China). The migration of iron, aluminium, calcium, magnesium and silicon from the ceramics was carried out in 4% (v/v) acetic acid water solution (24, 48 and 72 h at 20 degrees C; 30, 60 and 90 min at 180 degrees C). The concentrations of elements which had migrated into the test solutions were measured by absorption spectrometry (Fe, Al and Si) and titration (summary Ca and Mg). The migration of iron, aluminium, calcium, magnesium and silicon was observed in all tested ceramics samples. Overall, the migration of studied elements was higher in unglazed stewing potteries and increased with temperature. Migration was decreased in repeatedly used ware.",
1816,"Study on Processing Desulfurization Waste Water of Power Plant Using Polymeric Flocculant The power plant desulfurization wastewater is studied in a city of North China. The optimal conditions for preparing polymeric polysilicate aluminium ferric sulphate (PSAFS) was explored by L-9(3(4)) Results of Orthogonal Experiment, and the effect of dosage, pH value, the settling time and sedimentation time on PSAFS for disposal was investigated as well. It was shown that the performance of PSAFS was the best, while the concentration of SiO2 was 2.5%, the value of pH was 5.5, and the molar ratio of Al/Fe/Si was 1:1:1, aging time about 4 h. Under the conditions of PSAFS dosage 6.7 g/l and wastewater pH 10, settling time of 20 min, the suspended solids, COD, sulfide, fluoride and Cl- in the desulfurization wastewater had a good removal effect. Comparing with the polyaluminium chloride (PAC) for the treatment of the desulfurization waste water, PSAFS has the advantages such as less dosage, the higher efficiency, shorter settling time and co-treatment many pollutants.",
1817,"Geochemical modeling and multivariate statistical evaluation of trace elements in arsenic contaminated groundwater systems of Viterbo Area, (Central Italy) Contamination of groundwater by naturally occurring arsenic has recently become a disturbing environmental problem in Viterbo area, Central Italy. Arsenic concentrations in most of the public supply networks exceed the maximum allowable limit of 10 mu g/l (WHO) for drinking water. The primary purpose of this paper is to obtain a better understanding of the factors contributing to the high levels of As in water supply networks. This study focuses on (a) the determination of basic hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater, (b) the identification of the major sources and processes controlling the As contamination in public supply networks, (c) to find out possible relationships among the As and other trace elements through principal component analysis (PCA). Groundwater samples from public water supply wells and springs were collected and analysed for physico-chemical parameters and trace elements. Springs and well water samples are predominantly of the Na-HCO3, Na-Ca-HCO3 and Ca-HCO3 types and the highest arsenic concentrations were observed in Na-HCO3 type water. Eh-pH diagrams reveal that H(2)AsO(4)(2-)and HAsO42-, As(V) arsenate, are the dominating As species highlighting slightly to moderately oxidizing conditions. Geochemical modeling indicates that arsenic-bearing phases were undersaturated in the groundwater, however most of the samples were saturated with respect to Fe (i.e. magnetite, hematite and goethite) and Al (diaspore and boehmite) oxide and hydroxide minerals. Concentrations of As, Li, B, Co, Sr, Mo, U and Se are highly correlated (r > 0.7) with each other, however in some groundwater samples As show also good correlations (r > 0.5) with Fe and Mn elements reflecting the relationships among the trace elements result from different geochemical processes. Evaluation of the principal component (PCA) analysis and geochemical modeling suggest that the occurrence of As and other trace element concentrations in groundwater are probably derived from (i) weathering and/or dissolution of volcanic source aquifer materials and (ii) adsorption/desorption processes on the Fe and Al oxide and hydroxide minerals.",
1818,"Identification of artificial groundwater recharging zone using a GIS-based fuzzy logic approach: a case study in a coal mine area of the Damodar Valley, India The West Bokaro coalfield is a richest coal-mining belt in the Damodar Valley, India. The extensive mining of the area has resulted in disruption of the groundwater availability in terms of both quantity and quality. This has led to a drinking water crisis, especially during the pre-monsoon period in the West Bokaro coalfield area. The characterization of the hydrogeological system and the artificial recharging of the aquifers might help to better manage the problem of the groundwater-level depletion. For this purpose, seven important hydrogeological factors (water depth, slope, drainage, soil, infiltration, lithology, and landuse) have been considered to define the most suitable locations for artificial groundwater recharging in the mining area. Different thematic maps were prepared from existing maps and data sets, remote-sensing images, and field investigations for identification of the most suitable locations for artificial recharge. Thematic layers for these parameters were prepared, classified, weighted, and integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) environment by means of fuzzy logic. The results of the study indicate that about 29 and 31% of the area are very suitable and suitable for recharging purposes in the West Bokaro coalfield. However, the rest of the area is moderate to unsuitable for recharging due to the ongoing mining and related activities in the study area. The groundwater recharging map of the study area was validated with measured electrical conductivity (EC) values in the groundwater, and it indicated that validation can be accepted for the identification of groundwater recharging sites. These findings are providing useful information for the proper planning and sustainable management of the groundwater resources in the study area.",
1819,"Bayesian spatial design of optimal deep tube well locations in Matlab, Bangladesh We introduce a method for statistically identifying the optimal locations of deep tube wells (DTWs) to be installed in Matlab, Bangladesh. DTW installations serve to mitigate exposure to naturally occurring arsenic found at groundwater depths less than 200m, a serious environmental health threat for the population of Bangladesh. We introduce an objective function, which incorporates both arsenic level and nearest-town population size, to identify optimal locations for DTW placement. Assuming complete knowledge of the arsenic surface, we then demonstrate how minimizing the objective function over a domain favors DTWs placed in areas with high arsenic values and close to largely populated regions. Given only a partial realization of the arsenic surface over a domain, we use a Bayesian spatial statistical model to predict the full arsenic surface and estimate the optimal DTW locations. The uncertainty associated with these estimated locations is correctly characterized as well. The new method is applied to a dataset from a village in Matlab, and the estimated optimal locations are analyzed along with their respective 95% credible regions.

1820,"Effect of kaolinite as a key factor controlling the petrophysical properties of the Nubia sandstone in central Eastern Desert, Egypt This paper presents the results of a comprehensive petrographical and petrophysical investigation for the Late Cretaceous Nubia sandstone from Wadi Kareem in central Eastern Desert to measure their fluid flow properties and to investigate the effect of kaolinite on their petrophysical characteristics. From the petrographical analyses, scanning electron microscope 'SEM' and the X-ray diffraction 'XRD' analysis, it is shown that the studied sandstone samples are quite homogeneous in mineralogy and can be distinguished into four sedimentary microfacies: quartz arenite as a clean sandstone as well as three kaolinitic microfacies; namely they are kaolinitic quartz arenite, kaolinitic subarkose, and calcareous to kaolinitc quartz arenite. The main recognized diagenetic processes that prevailed during the post depositional history of the Nubia sandstone are; compaction, cementation, alteration and dissolution of feldspar into kaolinite. The petrophysical potentiality of the studied sandstones was studied using the helium pycnometer, gas permeability and mercury injection confining pressure 'MICP' techniques. The investigated sandstones can be classified into three petrophysical fades with varying reservoir performances. The petrophysical behaviour of these fades is dependent mostly on their kaolinite content and its impact on porosity, permeability, irreducible water saturation, R35 (pore aperture corresponding to mercury saturation of 35% pore volume), R50 (median pore-throat radius), and MHR (the mean hydraulic radius). Therefore, the studied petrophysical facies are comparable to the distinguished petrographical facies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1821,"Arsenic and other toxic elemental contamination of groundwater, surface: Water and soil in Bangladesh and its possible effects on human health The problems of contamination caused by arsenic (As) and other toxic metals in groundwater, surface water and soils in the Bengal basin of Bangladesh have been studied. Altogether 10 groundwater, seven surface water and 31 soil samples were collected from arsenic-affected areas and analysed chemically. The geologic and anthropogenic sources of As and other toxic metals are discussed in this paper. The chemical results show that the mean As concentrations in groundwater in the Char Ruppur (0.253 mg As L-1), Rajarampur (1.955 mg As L-1) and Shamta areas (0.996 mg As L-1) greatly exceed the WHO recommended value, which is 0.01 mg As L-1. The concentrations of As in groundwater are very high compared to those in surface water and in surface soil in the three (As-affected) areas studied. This indicates that the source of As in groundwater could be bedrock. The relatively high concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Ph and Zn in surface water, compared to world typical value, are due to the solubility of metal ions, organometalic complexes, coprecipitation or co-existance with the colloidal clay fraction. In the soil, the elevated concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ph and Zn are due to their strong affinity to organic matter, hydrous oxides of Fe and Mn, and clay minerals.",
1822,"Monitoring the Activated Sludge Activities Affected by Industrial Toxins via an Early-Warning System Based on the Relative Oxygen Uptake Rate (ROUR) Index Shock load from industrial wastewater is known to harm the microbial activities of the activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and disturb their performance. This study developed a system monitoring the activated sludge activities based on the relative oxygen uptake rate (ROUR) and explored the influential factors with wastewater and the activated sludge samples collected from a typical WWTP in the Taihu Lake of southern Jiangsu province, China. The ROUR was affected by the concentration of toxic substances, mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and pH. Higher toxin contents significantly decreased the ROUR and the EC50 value of Zn2+, Ni2+, Cr(VI), Cu2+, and Cd2+ was 13.40, 15.54, 97.56, 12.01, and 14.65 mg/L, respectively. The ROUR declined with the increasing HRT and MLSS above 2000 mg/L had buffering capacities for the impacts of toxic substances to some extent. The ROUR remained stable within a broad range pH (6-10), covering most of the operational pH in WWTPs and behaving as an appropriate indicator for monitoring the shock load. A toxicity model assessing and predicting the ROUR was developed and fitted well with experimental data. Coupling the ROUR monitoring system and toxicity model, an online early-warning system was assembled and successfully used for predicting the toxicity of different potential toxic metals. This study provides a new universal toxicity model and an online early-warning system for monitoring the shock load from industrial wastewater, which is useful for improving the performance of WWTPs.",
1823,"Disequilibrium of uranium mineralization - a case study of Devri area, Surajpur district, Chhattisgarh, India Disequilibrium in the uranium series is a vital parameter to ascertain the state of equilibrium between uranium group (parent uranium) and its daughters, i.e. radium group of elements. The U-238 isotope of uranium is the parent of 14 daughter isotopes forming the uranium series. The first five isotopes of U-238 series, i.e. U-238, Th-234, Pa-234, U-234 and Th-230 form uranium group and the sixth to last isotopes of U-238 series, i.e. Ra-226, Rn-222, Po-218, Pb-214, Bi-214, Po-214, Pb-210, Bi-210, Po-210 and Pb-206 form radium group. Isotopes in the uranium and radium group usually remain in equilibrium within the group, but disequilibrium commonly exists between the two groups. In an open system, the mobility of radium is significant due to radon gas produced as a daughter element in the radium series. Anomalies with excess radium are commonly found around springs and seepages, whereas uranium anomalies are usually found under reducing environments. A study was carried out in Devri area, Surajpur district, Chhattisgarh, India, to decipher the state of disequilibrium in the area by analysing the drill core samples (n = 4470) from 43 boreholes. This study has revealed a strong disequilibrium (65%) in favour of the parent uranium. This disequilibrium is due to cycles of dissolution and deposition of parent uranium; aided by the movement of groundwater and diverse geochemical behaviour of different radionuclides. In addition, loss of radon from the system might have also contributed to the disequilibrium in favour of the parent uranium. Linear regression coefficient between U3O8 (parent uranium) and RaEq.(U3O8) was calculated to be 0.82. Strong disequilibrium in favour of the parent uranium will enhance the uranium ore reserve in Devri area.",
1824,"Dynamic Behaviour of the Water-Food-Energy Nexus: Focus on Crop Production and Consumption Water, energy, and food are interrelated and critical resources for human well-being and environmental goals. Single-sector national strategies that focus on individual sectors of the nexus without considering their interconnections may lead to acute unanticipated consequences. In the present study, the system dynamic model platform was used to create a new approach to analysis of dynamic behaviour, focusing on joint water-energy-food interactions stemming from crop production and consumption at the national level under different scenarios and alternatives. The developed system determines: (i) water and energy footprints of crop production and consumption; (ii) virtual water and energy import and export; (iii) the national water and energy saving balance due to trade of agricultural commodities; and (iv) a water-food-energy nexus index.

1825,"Hierarchically structured Mg-Al mixed metal oxides templated from pine sawdust: fabrication, Congo red adsorption and antibacterial properties Biomorphic Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) templated from pine sawdust as precursors, hierarchically structured Mg-Al mixed metal oxides (MMOs) with well-developed porosity were prepared through biological template method and hydrothermal process. As-synthesized composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption measurements. Adsorption conditions including different Congo red concentration, contact time, pH and temperature were investigated. Antibacterial ability and mechanism against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed. MMOs exhibited higher adsorption and stronger antibacterial ability as compared with biomorphic LDHs. The concept provides new insight into design and preparation efficient adsorption and antibacterial materials.",
1826,"Estimation of groundwater recharge and its relation to land degradation: case study of a semi-arid river basin in Iran Groundwater extraction is one of the most important criteria of land degradation especially land subsidence in arid and semi-arid areas. Understanding the relationship between water extraction and recharge of groundwater can lead to better watershed management. For the estimation of groundwater recharge in Razan-Ghahavand watershed in Central Iran the Soil and Water Assessment Tools was used. Model calibration was done by using SUFI-2 based on monthly river discharge and annual crop yield, where crop yield was used to better estimate the evapotranspiration term, which consequently increased our knowledge on estimating aquifer recharge. The calibration results were satisfactory: The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency ranged from 0.53 to 0.63 for calibration and from 0.42 to 0.72 for validation. The results showed that, although the groundwater level was decreasing about 1 m per year, the groundwater recharge did not change significantly leading to a net withdrawal causing land subsidence over time.",
1827,"Water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan as green scale inhibitor in oil wells A water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan (CMC) was prepared in water/isopropanol (2/8) medium, at 10 degrees C, and characterized by UV-vis, FT-IR and NMR techniques. Its performance as an environmentally friendly scale inhibitor in oil wells was evaluated under the physicochemical conditions of oil wells in northeast of Brazil, by using SEM, visual compatibility and dynamic tube blocking test. The synthesis conditions led to a degree of carboxymethylation of 0.45 and water-solubility in all pH range studied (1-11). CMC acted as a scale inhibitor of CaCO3 under synthetic brine medium, presenting a minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) of 170 ppm (1000 psi, T = 70 degrees C). SEM images showed that CaCO3 crystals were deformed by CMC, which was attributed to effective interactions of CMC through its carboxylate ions and lone pair of electrons on OH and NH2 groups with calcium ions, preventing scale deposition.",
1828,"A sensitive method for simultaneous determination of 12 classes of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in groundwater by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) comprise a large group of chemicals with diverse physicochemical properties, which make their simultaneous determination a challenging task. A trace analytical method based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) was developed for simultaneous determination of 54 PFASs belonging to 12 classes in groundwater, including 24 perfluorocarbons and 30 precursors. This method provided good linearity of calibration standards (R(2)Â >Â 0.99), excellent method limits of quantification (MLOQs) (0.5-250Â pg/L), satisfactory matrix spiking recoveries (63%-148%), high precision (intra-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) 1.4-11.4%, inter-day RSDs 1.6-12.9%, and inter-week RSDs 2.1-12.7%), and short runtime (13Â min), suitable for high throughput studies. The newly established method was successfully applied to detect PFASs in the groundwater samples collected from Hebei Province, China. Twenty PFASs were detected with the total concentration of 0.3-32.9Â ng/L, indicating the contamination level similar to that in drinking water. The dominant PFASs were perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). In addition, 6:2 fluorotelomer phosphate diester (6:2 diPAP) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) were found as the major precursors. The total PFAS concentrations were lower than the cumulative permissible limit of 70Â ng/L for PFOS and PFOA recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for drinking water in 2016. In a nutshell, this study provided a fast and sensitive method based on HRMS for the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of PFASs, present at trace levels in groundwater samples.",
1829,"Validation and Modification of the Van Genuchten Model for Eroded Black Soil in Northeastern China The soil water characteristic curve is highly related to soil physical characteristics, which may be affected by the soil erosion degree. To explore the applicability of the soil moisture characteristic curve model in northeastern China, two erosion degrees, (1) lightly and (2) severely eroded black soil sampled from 15 sites, were collected. The soil water contents at eight soil water suctions were measured and the parameters of the Van Genuchten (VG) model were estimated. Then, two input sets-SSCBD (sand, silt and clay percentages and bulk density) and SSCBD theta(33)theta(1500) (SSCBD, and water contents at 33 and 1500 kPa suction) based on the Rosetta model were compared for the VG model prediction. The results showed that the parameters in the VG model had significant difference under the two eroded soils of the saturated water content (theta s), but the opposite was true for the residual water content (theta r), the scale parameter (alpha) and the shape parameter (n). In addition, the theta s and theta r had no significant differences but the opposite was true for the alpha and n under the two input sets. The simulated soil water content values of the VG model parameters derived from the Rosetta model underestimated the measured ones, except the water contents at 0 kPa. Therefore the relationships between m and n were modified for accuracy. The validation results showed that the VG model performed well when the sand content was less than 80% for the input set of SSCBD. Using the input set of SSCBD theta(33)theta(1500) can lead to higher simulation accuracy and wider applicability compared with SSCBD under black soil.",
1830,"Multi-element determination of heavy metals in the Han River of Korea using liquid-liquid extraction flame atomic absorption spectrometry A method of multi-element determination of hazardous heavy metals such as Cd, Cu and Pb in the water of the Han River is described in this paper. The liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) methods using N,N'-diethyldithiocarbamate-methylisobutylketone (DDTC-MIBK) and ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate-methylisobutylketone (APDC-MIBK) were compared by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). For quantitative analysis, DDTC-MIBK extraction was adopted due to its good recoveries (average 93.0% for 3 elements), detection limits (3.4-18.6 ng/l), repeatability (C.V. 1.13-4.57%) and accuracy (average 97.5%). The multi-element determination was available because no interference effect was observed on 3 kinds of metal coexisting in an aqueous matrix. The heavy metal concentrations in the aqueous samples collected from 12 separate points of the Han River averaged 4.204 ppb for Cd, 8.563 ppb for Cu and 2.462 ppb for Pb, respectively. Cd existed almost in suspended particles in water, Cu existed half in suspended particles and half in dissolved form and Pb was almost completely found in particles and only 7% in dissolved form.",
1831,"Does our limited analysis of the dimensions of poverty limit the way we seek solutions? Introduction Poverty is rarely about one thing - it is about having no money, no voice, no infrastructure and no opportunities. Voices of the Poor (World Bank 2000). Poverty and other forms of social disadvantage are multidimensional in their manifestations, multifactoral in their causes, and complex in the pathways through which they operate on health and well-being. However, there is a danger that the high level of interest in the public health community in the statistical relationship between unequal income distribution and health may lead to an oversimplification of both the nature of poverty and the action required to address health inequality. Also, a preoccupation with describing associations and developing models for explaining causal pathways leaves public health workers open to criticism of developing a research industry that has few tangible benefits for those whose health is most vulnerable. This paper raises issues that need to be considered as complex notions of poverty and social disadvantage are transferred from (often complex) sociological to (often relatively simple) public health frameworks. For instance: â€¢ Are measures of income and income distribution simply proxies for a more complex and systemic web of disadvantage? â€¢ Is poverty better understood as a set of issues affecting an individual, family network or community rather than as a single entity in itself? â€¢ Does the current emphasis on relative poverty blind us to the absolute paucity of resources and life chances experienced by some Australians? â€¢ Is our limited analysis of the dimensions of poverty preventing a more sophisticated approach to solutions? â€¢ And most importantly, if, as some argue, the prime cause of health inequalities in developed countries is the very unequal income distribution, and the remedies for this lie so clearly outside the mandate of the health system, are health workers released from any responsibility to act? Additionally, we reflect on the limitations of the income inequality argument that are emerging in the literature, and examine the ways in which an analysis that is based on simple, strong statistical associations between income inequality and health may be limiting effective action to reduce health inequalities. It is not our purpose to throw the baby out with the bath water. We do not dispute the observed relationship between income inequality and health but seek to reflect on the limitations of this approach in understanding the origins of health inequality and in taking action to redress these inequalities.

1832,"Effects of chemical impregnation agents on the characterisation of porosity and surface area of activated carbon prepared from sago palm bark Unprocessed sago palm bark (SPB) is a material that has been newly utilised for preparations of activated carbons (AC), using physicochemical activation techniques comprising dual carbonisation and activation phases. Activations have been conducted utilising three agents: sulphuric acid (H2SO4), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and zinc chloride (Z(n)Cl(2)). Characterisations of the porosities of AC preparations were performed using N-2 adsorption-desorption to ascertain BET and micropore surface areas as well as micropore volumes and pore-size distributions. Existing groups on the AC surfaces were resolved using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTlR) analyses. The morphologies of the activated carbons were assessed via scanning-electron microscopic methods (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic techniques (EDX). The maximal surface areas (1639.34 m(2)/g), pore volume (0.649 cm(3)/g), micropore volume (0.335 cm(3)/g), and micropore surface area (1,148.58 m(2)/g) of the prepared AC using sago palm bark were discovered at activation temperatures of 700 degrees C and with chemical impregnation ratios of 1.51/ zinc chloride to precursors. In the instance of KOH and H2SO4 utilisation, the surface areas of the AC preparations corresponded to 970.38 m(2)/g and 630.73 m(2)/g with pore volume of 0.458 and 0.196 cm(3)/g, respectively.",
1833,"Improving water quality index prediction in Perak River basin Malaysia through a combination of multiple neural networks This paper proposes a method for the real-time prediction of water quality index (WQI) by excluding the biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand, which are not measured in real time, from the model inputs. In this study, feedforward artificial neural networks are used to model the WQI in Perak River basin Malaysia due to its capability in modelling nonlinear systems. The results show that the developed single feedforward neural network model can predict WQI very well with the coefficient of determination R2 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.9090 and 0.1740 on the unseen validation data, respectively. In addition to that, the aggregation of multiple neural networks in predicting the WQI further improves the prediction performance on the unseen validation data. Forward selection and backward elimination selective combination methods are used to combine multiple neural networks and both methods lead to 6 and 5 networks being combined with R2 and MSE of 0.9340, 0.9270 and 0.1156, 0.1256, respectively. It is clearly shown that combining multiple neural networks does improve the performance for WQI prediction.",
1834,"Cryptosporidiosis in developing countries Globally, Cryptosporidium infection continues to be a significant health problem where it is recognized as an important cause of diarrhoea in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent people. In developing countries persistent diarrhoea is the leading cause of death in children younger than five years of age, where it accounts for 30 to 50 percent of those deaths. Encouragingly an increasing number of investigations in developing countries employ molecular tools, significantly improving the quality of epidemiological information. This improved Cryptosporidium monitoring, with appropriate molecular methods, in surface water, livestock, wildlife and humans, will increase current knowledge of infection and transmission patterns, and ultimately help to control Cryptosporidium via improved risk assessments in the future.",
1835,"Green microwave-assisted synthesis of hierarchical NiO architectures displaying a fast and high adsorption behavior for Congo red Well dispersed NiO architectures with in-built nanostructure were successfully achieved via a green microwave-assisted aqueous chemical reaction followed by a calcination process. The as-prepared products were characterized by XRD, FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. The results indicated that the three-dimensional (3D) flower-like microspheres with 400-600 nm in diameter are assembled by the pure cubic NiO nanosheets with the thickness of about 10 nm. It should be noted that the interconnecting ultrathin nanosheets have intercrystal mesoporosity and the in homogeneous multimodal mesopores are ranging from 2.3 to 30.4 nm. A formation mechanism for NiO architectures was simply proposed. In addition, for dye removal in water, the as-obtained NiO as adsorbent exhibited a fast and high adsorption behavior for Congo red (CR), suggesting a promising application in water treatment.

1836,"Physicochemical characterization of three natural clays used as adsorbent for the humic acid removal from aqueous solution Adsorption behaviours of humic acid on three natural clays from Ivory Coast were studied. In order to investigate the adsorption mechanism, characterization of clays and the humic acid- complex was conducted by using various analytical methods (attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area analysis (BET) and chemical composition). As a result, adsorption process showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of humic acid was achieved at pH = 3 and was found to be to 115 mg/g obtained for the best sample. For all clays, the adsorption was found to be strongly dependent on pH and well fitted by the Langmuir model. In addition, it was shown that the adsorption capacity was linked to the kaolinite content of each sample. The results showed that humic acid adsorption onto clay was made via electrostatic interactions, ligand exchange and hydrophobic interactions. This study showed that clays are valuable adsorbents for the removal of humic acid.",
1837,"Assessment of groundwater quality in Bahariya Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt Groundwater quality and the overall rate of abstraction from the Nubian sandstone aquifer system in the Bahariya Oasis was assessed to determine whether the resource was of a suitable quality for its current use and that that the current usage is sustainable. The hydrochemical analysis of 84 representative groundwater wells was carried out to determine the main hydrochemical characters, genesis and evaluation of the groundwater quality for different uses. The physical and chemical characteristics were measured for the groundwater according to standard methods, such as temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, major anions and cations, and heavy metals such as iron, manganese and zinc. The average values of the EC, TDS, pH, major cations and anions did not exceed the recommended limits for drinking water set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Most of the three aquifer zones contain freshwater with an average TDS content of 286 mg/l. Manganese concentrations exceed the recommended WHO drinking water limit.",
1838,"Fuzzy Classification for Shoreline Change Monitoring in a Part of the Northern Coastal Area of Java, Indonesia This study presents an unsupervised fuzzy c-means classification (FCM) to observe the shoreline positions. We combined crisp and fuzzy methods for change detection. We addressed two perspectives of uncertainty: (1) uncertainty that is inherent to shoreline positions as observed from remote sensing images due to its continuous variation over time; and (2) the uncertainty of the change results propagating from object extraction and implementation of shoreline change detection method. Unsupervised FCM achieved the highest kappa (kappa) value when threshold (t) was set at 0.5. The highest kappa values were 0.96 for the 1994 image. For images in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the kappa values were 0.95. Further, images in 2003, 2002 and 2000 obtained 0.93, 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. Gradual and abrupt changes were observed, as well as a measure of change uncertainty for the observed objects at the pixel level. These could be associated with inundations from 1994 to 2015 at the northern coastal area of Java, Indonesia. The largest coastal inundations in terms of area occurred between 1994 and 2000, when 739 ha changed from non-water and shoreline to water and in 2003-2013 for 200 ha. Changes from water and shoreline to non-water occurred between 2000 and 2002 (186 ha) and in 2013-2014 (65 ha). Urban development in flood-prone areas resulted in an increase of flood hazards including inundation and erosion leading to the changes of shoreline position. The proposed methods provided an effective way to present shoreline as a line and as a margin with fuzzy boundary and its associated change uncertainty. Shoreline mapping and monitoring is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of coastal inundation including its trend.",
1839,"Studies on Bioflocculant Production by Arthrobacter sp Raats, a Freshwater Bacteria Isolated from Tyume River, South Africa A bioflocculant-producing bacteria was isolated from Tyume River in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa and identified by 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence to have 91% similarity to Arthrobacter sp. 5J12A, and the nucleotide sequence was deposited in GenBank as Arthrobacter sp. Raats (accession number HQ875723). The bacteria produced an extracellular bioflocculant when grown aerobically in a production medium containing glucose as sole carbon source and had an initial pH of 7.0. Influences of carbon, nitrogen and metal ions sources, as well as initial pH on flocculating activity were investigated. The bacteria optimally produced the bioflocullant when lactose and urea were used as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen respectively with flocculating activities of 75.4% and 83.4% respectively. Also, the bacteria produced the bioflocculant optimally when initial pH of the medium was 7.0 (flocculating activity 84%), and when Mg2+ was used as cation (flocculating activity 77%). Composition analyses indicated the bioflocculant to be principally a glycoprotein made up of about 56% protein and 25% total carbohydrate.",
1840,"Evolving human dimensions and the need for continuous health assessment of Indian rivers River health assessment (RHA) protocols are the tools used globally that emphasize upon factors which contribute for ecological fitness of the river such as catchment health, floodplain health, channel health, flow health, quality health and biotic health indicators. Human intervention by constructions of dams, excess water abstraction, channel diversion and several other factors contribute to the depletion of diverse flora and fauna of a river. For the societal well being, it appears that RHA programmes associated with a culturally sensitive river such as River Ganga in India need a move beyond top-down technocratic approach towards one that creates inclusive spaces for collaboration and public participation. Moreover, there appears a need for continuous RHA of the river to bridge the gap between science and the sacred. Based on available literature we propose a community-based comprehensive RHA model which anchors on the premise that people's relationship with the river and human values are central to any effort towards restoration and sustainable river health management in India.",
1841,"An improved method to determine accurate porosity of low-rank coals by nuclear magnetic resonance For existing experimental methods, drying the sample to eliminate the effects of water in the pores is usually the first step to accurately measure the porosity of the coal reservoir. However, drying coal with relatively low rank easily leads to changes in the pore structure. In this study, we propose an improved NMR method to eliminate the signal of water in the connected pores by dipole-dipole interaction and spin-exchange interaction between the Mn2+ and the hydrogen proton. Thereby providing a simple and easy-to-use method for distinguishing connected pores and isolated pores in coal reservoirs. When the water-saturated sample is submerged in the MnCl2 solution, the movement of Mn2+ is mainly due to the diffusion. At a certain temperature, reservoir porosity, water saturation, and pore tortuosity-connectivity are the most important factors affecting the diffusion rate of Mn2+ in coal reservoirs. Due to the extremely high porosity, and well-connected, low-tortuosity pore structure of low-rank coal, Mn2+ can rapidly diffuse in its pore network. The accurate connected porosity and isolated porosity were calculated by this method. In general, during coalification processes, the originally well-connected pores were compacted and deformed, coupled with the matrix shrinkage, resulting in an increase in isolated porosity.",
1842,"Hydrochemistry of arsenic-enriched aquifer from rural West Bengal, India: A study of the arsenic exposure and mitigation option The present study aims to understand the hydrochemistry vis-a-vis As-exposure from drinking groundwater in rural Bengal. The characteristic feature of the groundwaters are low Eh (range, -151 to -37 mV; mean, -68 mV) and nitrate (range, 0.01-1.7 mg/l; mean, 0.14 mg/l) followed by high alkalinity (range, 100-630 mg/l; mean, 301 mg/l), Fe (range, 0.99-38 mg/l; mean, 8.1 mg/l), phosphate (range, 0.01-15 mg/l; mean, 0.54 mg/l), hardness (range, 46-600 mg/l; mean, 245 mg/l) and sulphate (range, 0.19-88 mg/l; mean, 7.2 mg/l), indicating reducing nature of the aquifer. The land use pattern (sanitation, surface water bodies, sanitation coupled with surface water bodies and agricultural lands) demonstrates local enrichment factor for As/Fe in groundwater. Among these, sanitation is the most prevailing where groundwater is generally enriched with As (mean, 269 mu g/l) and Fe (mean, 9.8 mg/l). Questionnaire survey highlights that similar to 70% of the villagers in the study area do not have proper sanitation. This demonstrating the local unsewered sanitation (organic waste, anthropogenic in origin) could also cause As toxicity in rural Bengal. In the agricultural lands, higher mean values of alkalinity, phosphate, sulphate, hardness and electrical conductivity was observed, and could be linked with the excessive use of fertilizers for agricultural production. Bio-markers study indicates that the accumulation of As in hair and nail is related with the construction of exposure scenario with time dimension. The strength and weakness of the on-going West Bengal and Bangladesh drinking water supply scenario and achievability towards alternative options are also evaluated.",
1843,"Prevalence of veterinary antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli in the surface water of a livestock production region in northern China This study investigated the occurrence of 12 veterinary antibiotics (VAs) and the susceptibility of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a rural water system that was affected by livestock production in northern China. Each of the surveyed sites was determined with at least eight antibiotics with maximum concentration of up to 450 ng L(-1). The use of VAs in livestock farming probably was a primary source of antibiotics in the rivers. Increasing total antibiotics were measured from up- to mid- and downstream in the two tributaries. Eighty-eight percent of the 218 E. coli isolates that were derived from the study area exhibited, in total, 48 resistance profiles against the eight examined drugs. Significant correlations were found among the resistance rates of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, chloromycetin and ampicillin as well as between tetracycline and chlortetracycline, suggesting a possible cross-selection for resistance among these drugs. The E. coli resistance frequency also increased from up- to midstream in the three rivers. E. coli isolates from different water systems showed varying drug numbers of resistance. No clear relationship was observed in the antibiotic resistance frequency with corresponding antibiotic concentration, indicating that the antibiotic resistance for E. coli in the aquatic environment might be affected by factors besides antibiotics. High numbers of resistant E. coli were also isolated from the conserved reservoir. These results suggest that rural surface water may become a large pool of VAs and resistant bacteria. This study contributes to current information on VAs and resistant bacteria contamination in aquatic environments particularly in areas under intensive agriculture. Moreover, this study indicates an urgent need to monitor the use of VAs in animal production, and to control the release of animal-originated antibiotics into the environment.",
1844,"Hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics of surface water and groundwater in the Qinghai Lake catchment (China) Qinghai Lake plays an important role in the study of climate change in the western China and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift processes and environmental effects. This study focused on the hydrogeochemistry of different waters (river, lake, groundwater, and precipitation) around and within Qinghai Lake. We analyzed major chemical elements and stable isotopes to examine water-rock interactions and the hydrogeochemical evolution of lake. The geochemical characteristics of river, groundwater, and precipitation have direct effects on the chemical composition of lake. The hydrochemical type of the river was HCO3-Ca center dot Na or HCO3-Na center dot Ca; groundwater was HCO3-Na center dot Ca, Cl center dot HCO3-Na center dot Ca, or HCO3-Ca center dot Na; and lake was Cl-Na, which was different from Erhai (Cl center dot HCO3-Na). The different geological settings and amount of river and groundwater input between the Buha and Shaliu subcatchments led to fluctuation in the major chemical ions present in the Buha River. The supply to river and groundwater is different in the various areas and manifests as overlap in the ion concentrations in river and groundwater. The relationship of major ions showed that sulfate reduction, ion exchange, carbonate and silicate rock weathering, dissolution, and evaporation occurred in the evolution of the groundwater, river, and lake in the Qinghai Lake catchment. The evolution of Qinghai Lake may be towards poor calcium and potassium enrichment as well as the removal of carbonate and increasing chloride. The salinity of Qinghai Lake is likely to become much higher if the amount of river and groundwater input decreases or the climate continues to dry in the future.",
1845,"Determination of glyphosate, AMPA and glufosinate in dairy farm water from Argentina using a simplified UHPLC-MS/MS method Argentina, together with the USA and Brazil, produces approximately 80% of the total worldwide glyphosate loadings. The development of a simplified ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method (UHPLC-MS/MS) for the determination of glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and glufosinate in water is described, including studies of several alternatives of 9-fluorenylmethylchloroformate (FMOC-Cl) derivatization and pretreatment steps. The proposed method includes acidification and neutralization of a low sample volume (3â€¯mL), 2â€¯hours derivatization step, cleanup with dichloromethane, followed by reverse phase UHPLC-MS/MS determination of the analytes. Figures of merit were satisfactory in terms of linearity, selectivity, accuracy and intermediate precision (%REC 70-105% with RSDâ€¯<â€¯15%). Limits of quantification (LOQ) were suitable for monitoring purposes (0.6, 0.2, 0.1â€¯Î¼g/L for glyphosate, AMPA and glufosinate respectively). The validated methodology was applied for the analysis of livestock wells waters from 40 dairy farms located in the central region of Argentina. Glyphosate and AMPA were quantified in 15% and 53% of the analyzed samples with concentrations ranging from 0.6-11.3â€¯Î¼g/L and 0.2-6.5â€¯Î¼g/L respectively. Greater concentrations of glyphosate were also verified in waters from open-reservoir tanks, which are directly exposed to the farm environment. In these cases glyphosate and AMPA occurrence increased, being quantified in the 33% and 61% of the samples with values ranging 0.6-21.2â€¯Î¼g/L and 0.2-4.2â€¯Î¼g/L respectively. Also in this case glufosinate was found in 52% samples at <LOQ levels and was quantified in one sample at 0.1â€¯Î¼g/L. This new information constitutes an important contribution to authorities and scientists for further research, control and risk analysis purposes.",
1846,"A Novel Method for Borehole Blockage Removal and Experimental Study on a Hydraulic Self-Propelled Nozzle in Underground Coal Mines When coal bed methane (CBM) drainage boreholes cross fractured, soft, or water-swelling strata, they collapse and block frequently. Borehole blockages result in a rapid decrease in CBM extraction ability, which leads to a reduction in CBM output and threatens coal mine safety production. To solve these problems, a novel method that uses a self-propelled water-jet nozzle to dredge blocked boreholes in coal seams has been proposed on the basis of the existing technology. Based on a theoretical analysis of the reason for borehole caving and the theory of blockage removal, we optimized the nozzle inlet pressure and selected an appropriate high-pressure resin pipe. A field experiment on the blockage removal of blocked CBM drainage boreholes using the proposed method was run in the Fengchun coal mine, Qijiang, Chongqing, southwest China. In this field trial, the time spent to unblock a borehole varied between 18.52 and 34.98 min, which is much shorter than using a drilling rig. After blockage removal, the average pure volume of the methane drainage of a single borehole was increased from 0.03 L/min to similar to 1.91-7.30 L/min, and the methane drainage concentration of a single borehole increased from 5% to similar to 44%-85%. The extraction effect increased significantly.",
1847,"FERULOYLATED ARABINOXYLANS RECOVERED FROM LOW-VALUE MAIZE BY-PRODUCTS Maize bran and nejayote (a maize processing waste water) generated from tortilla-making industries in Mexico were investigated as source of water soluble feruloylated arabinoxylans. The tortilla industry is important in Mexico since half of the total volume of consumed food is maize. Therefore, maize residues are potential source of these added-value biomolecules as hydrocolloids for the food industry, considering the volume they represent. Both by-products were treated for these polysaccharides extraction. Because of their different nature, the polymers extracted from each byproduct showed different composition, physico-chemical and functional properties. Feruloylated arabinoxylans from maize bran (FAXMB) presented an arabinoxylan content of 74% (why), a ferulic acid content of 0.34 mu g/mg FAXMB, an arabinose to xylose ratio (A/X) of 0.85, an intrinsic viscosity [eta] of 208 mL/g and a molecular weight (Mw) of 190 kDa. Gels were obtained from this FAXMB by laccase covalent cross-linking of ferulic acid leading to the formation of diferulic (di-FA) and triferulic (tri-FA) acid. Gels elasticity increased from 9 to 14 Pa as the FAXMB concentration changed from 2.5 to 3.5 % (w/v), while the di-FA and tri-FA contents remained constant (0.030 and 0.015 mu g/mg FAXMB, respectively). On the other hand, feruloylated arabinoxylans extracted from nejayote (FAXN) showed a ferulic acid content of 0.23 mu g/mg, an A/X ratio of 0.65, an [eta] of 183 mL/g and a Mw of 60 kDa. Gels were obtained from 4% (w/v) FAXN solution, while no gelation was observed at lower concentrations. Gels elasticity increased from 2 to 4 Pa, as the FAXN concentration increased from 4 to 8 % (w/v), while no change in the di-FA and tri-FA contents was registered (0.020 and 0.010 mu g/mg FAXN, respectively). The entrapment of insulin or beta-lactoglobulin at 0.1% (w/v) in gels at 3.5 % (w/v) in FAXMB was investigated as well. Insulin and beta-lacto-globulin did not modify either the gel elasticity or the cross-links content. Protein release rate from gels was dependent upon their molecular weight. The apparent diffusion coefficient was 0.95 x 10(-7) and 0.74 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s for insulin (5 kDa) and beta-lactoglobulin (18 kDa), respectively. The results suggest that FAXMB gels can be potential candidates for the controlled release of proteins. Furthermore, recovery of these gums from low-value maize by-products could represent a commercial advantage in comparison to other gums commonly used.",
1848,"Groundwater Pollution and Human Health Risks in an Industrialized Region of Southern India: Impacts of the COVID-19 Lockdown and the Monsoon Seasonal Cycles Samples of groundwater were collected during a post-monsoon period (January) and a pre-monsoon period (May) in 2020 from 30 locations in the rapidly developing industrial and residential area of the Coimbatore region in southern India. These sampling periods coincided with times before and during the lockdown in industrial activity and reduced agricultural activity that occurred in the region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of reduced anthropogenic activity on groundwater quality. Approximately 17% of the wells affected by high fluoride concentrations in the post-monsoon period returned to levels suitable for human consumption in samples collected in the pre-monsoon period. This was probably due to ion exchange processes, infiltration of rainwater during the seasonal monsoon that diluted concentrations of ions including geogenic fluoride, as well as a reduction in anthropogenic inputs during the lockdown. The total hazard index for fluoride in the post-monsoon samples calculated for children, adult women, and adult men indicated that 73%, 60%, and 50% of the groundwater samples, respectively, had fluoride levels higher than the permissible limit. In this study, nitrate pollution declined by 33.4% by the pre-monsoon period relative to the post-monsoon period. The chemical facies of groundwater reverted from the Na-HCO(3)-Cl and Na-Cl to the Ca-HCO(3) type in pre-monsoon samples. Various geogenic indicators like molar ratios, inter-ionic relations along with graphical tools demonstrated that plagioclase mineral weathering, carbonate dissolution, reverse ion exchange, and anthropogenic inputs are influencing the groundwater chemistry of this region. These findings were further supported by the saturation index assessed for the post- and pre-monsoon samples. COVID-19 lockdown considerably reduced groundwater pollution by Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), NO(3Â¯), and F(-) ions due to shutdown of industries and reduced agricultural activities. Further groundwater quality improvement during lockdown period there is evidence that the COVID-19 lockdown by increased HCO(3Â¯) ion concentration. Overall results illustrate the positive benefits to groundwater quality that could occur as a result of measures to control anthropogenic inputs of pollutants.",
1849,"Hydrogeochemical processes identification and groundwater pollution causes analysis in the northern Ordos Cretaceous Basin, China It is necessary to identify the hydrogeochemical processes and analyze the causes of groundwater pollution due to the lack of knowledge about the groundwater chemical characteristics and the endemic diseases caused by groundwater pollution in the northern Ordos Cretaceous Basin. In this paper, groundwater chemical facies were obtained using the piper trilinear diagram based on the analysis of 190 samples. The hydrogeochemical processes were identified using ionic ratio coefficient, such as leaching, evaporation and condensation. The causes and sources of groundwater pollution were analyzed by correspondence analysis, and the spatial distribution and enrichment reasons of fluoride ion were analyzed considering the endemic fluorosis emphatically. The results show that leaching, evaporation and condensation, mixing, and anthropogenic activities all had significant impact on hydrogeochemical processes in the study area. However, cation exchange and adsorption effects were strong in the S2 and S3 groundwater flow systems, but weak in S1. Groundwater is mainly polluted by Mn and CODMn in the study area. The landfill leachate, domestic sewage, and other organic pollutants, excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture, and pyrite oxidation from long-term and large-scale exploitation of coal are the sources of groundwater pollution. The S1 has the highest degree of groundwater pollution, followed by S2 and S3. High concentration of fluoride ion is mainly distributed in the north and west of study area. Evaporation and condensation and groundwater chemistry component are the most important causes of fluoride ion enrichment. The results obtained in this study will be useful for understanding the groundwater quality for effective management and utilization of groundwater resources and assurance of drinking water safety.",
1850,"Advanced Predication of Geological anomalous Body Ahead of Laneway Using Seismic Tomography Technique Advanced predication of geological anomalous body (GAB) of laneway can provide scientific references for mine safety production. It refers to reveal the position, shape and size of GAB in advance. Seismic tomography technology (STT) can realize the prediction of GAB using tunnel surface waves. Tunnel Reflection Tomography (TRT) 6000 system, which is on the basis of STT, has the advantages of convenience and high reliability. In this paper, TRT6000 is introduced to forecast the GAB ahead of laneway in underground metal mine. The operation steps, data processing and notes about TRT6000 are detailed. The research results show that there are two water flowing fractures, separately located at around 50meters and 85meters ahead of laneway. And the prediction results match the actual situation well. Therefore, the seismic tomography technology improves the mine safety management, and the TRT6000 provides a new method for predicting GAB in advance. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1851,"Speciation of organic and inorganic selenium in selenium-enriched rice by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after cloud point extraction A new method was developed for the determination of organic and inorganic selenium in selenium-enriched rice by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry detection after cloud point extraction. Effective separation of organic and inorganic selenium in selenium-enriched rice was achieved by sequentially extracting with water and cyclohexane. Under the optimised conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.08 mu g L-1, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 2.1% (c = 10.0 mu g L-1, n = 11), and the enrichment factor for selenium was 82. Recoveries of inorganic selenium in the selenium-enriched rice samples were between 90.3% and 106.0%. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of organic and inorganic selenium as well as total selenium in selenium-enriched rice. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

1852,"Origin and Geochemistry of Mine Water and its Impact on the Groundwater and Surface Running Water in Post-mining Environments: Zlatna Gold Mining Area (Romania) In application at the Zlatna gold mining area (Apuseni Mountains, Romania), the correlation of water isotopes and geochemical data were successfully used to assess the genetic relationships between surface running water, groundwater and mine water, as well as to evaluate the mining effects on the surrounding environment after the cessation of mining operations. The majority of mine water sources display pH values between 4 and 5, i.e. acid mine water. The mine water characterized by slightly higher pH values (6) interacts with ophiolitic rocks which have high pH buffering capacity. The neutral mine water (pH 7) does not come into direct contact with reactive minerals, either because it is discharged from an exploration adit or because of the complete leaching of pyrite and other sulphides in old abandoned mining works. The later also shows low levels of heavy metals concentrations. Calcium is the dominant cation in mine water and in the majority of surface running water and groundwater sources, indicating the same mechanisms of mineralization. All mine water sources are SO42- type and show very high SO42- concentrations (6539 mg/l mean value). Surface and groundwater sources are classified either as SO42- or as HCO3- type water. Linear correlation between delta D and delta O-18 values indicates that all water sources belong to the meteoric cycle. Low delta D and delta O-18 values of mine water (delta D < -70 parts per thousand; delta O-18 < -10 parts per thousand) suggest snow melt and high-altitude precipitations as the main source of recharge. The mine water is less affected by the seasonal variation of temperature. In most cases, the variations in isotopic composition are within narrow limits (less than 1 parts per thousand for both delta D and delta O-18), and this result suggests well-mixed underground systems. Elevated concentration of sulphates, Zn and Fe in mine waters are the main issues of concern. For the study area, no relevant contamination of springs or phreatic water by mine water was revealed. On the contrary, surface running water is contaminated by mine water, and the negative effects of acid mine drainage occur mainly in the summer months when the flow of the surface running water decreases.",
1853,"Surfactant-promoted enhancement in bioremediation of hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium by naturally occurring wall algae The discharge of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] has resulted in significant pollution because of the presence of Cr(VI) oxyanions. They are highly water-soluble, cell-permeable and transportable in water sources. To eliminate the toxic effects, various chemical and biological methods have been developed. Bioremediation can be used as an effective tool over conventional chemical processes for the removal of toxic hexavalent chromium species. Blue-green algae-mediated bioremediation is gaining more interest due to its availability and efficiency. In this method, [Cr(VI)] is reduced to relatively less toxic [Cr(III)] as a consequence of oxidation of organic components present in the water extract of wall algae. The percent removal of Cr(VI) is increased by the addition of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the neutral surfactant Triton-X-100 (TX-100). It was found that the percent removal efficiency of unanalyzed, TX-100 and SDS catalyzed (3 x 10(-2) M) systems are approximately 47, 54 and 80 %, respectively, in 8 days. The efficiency of these systems increases with the increase in the equivalent amount of added surfactant (3 x 10(-1) M). The reaction proceeds to almost completion (96 %) with the increase in the added surfactant (3 x 10(-1) M). The optimum pH of the reaction was found to be 2 and the temperature 40 A degrees C. The amount of Cr(III) formed was measured by the fluorescence technique with a known dye selective to Cr(III), and the presence of soluble Cr(VI) in the mixture was estimated by a diphenylcarbazide kit. This method was further used to determine the removal efficiency of the SDS-catalyzed system in collected [Cr(VI)]-contaminated water sources, i.e. a pond beside the Sukinda valley in Cuttack, India, and pond water from the local area, sea water from Cuttack and Digha, W.B., India, as well as from the tanning industry. All the observations were recorded using UV-Vis, fluorescence and FTIR spectrophotometry.",
1854,"Solar Heating and Cooling in hot and humid climates - sol.e.h.(2) Project Introduction Energy saving in buildings is important to modern urbanization and especially challenging under the hot and humid climatic conditions of Guangdong (P. R. China). Minimized energy demand for heating (domestic hot water), ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in buildings is a major premise for the implementation of solar HVAC systems. The nearly zero energy building concept and solar HVAC complement each other well and are under investigations in the Austrian-Chinese research project sol.e.h.(2). The implementation of an optimized building (Passive House) and solar cooling supported HVAC lead to a joint integral solution far beyond state of the art. Innovative applications of solar cooling components and new building integration methods for this very specific climate in Guangdong region are the core of this project. The joint integral system will further be developed under appropriate innovative business models. This paper introduces the current status of buildings and solar cooling in China and presents the project idea and its methodology used to develop a solar driven nearly zero energy building in the course of sol.e.h.(2) project.",
1855,"High capacity mechanical water - Vapor compression vacuum ice machines for district cooling and heating The theoretical advantages of the refrigeration cycle using the vacuum ice cooling process based on a water vapor refrigerant cycle are well know and have already been demonstrated in various small scale applications. The advantages include: low energy consumption, reduced capital investment in heat exchangers and coolant piping systems, and lower overall operating and maintenance costs. However, the commercial development of large scale water vapor refrigerant systems for the production of pumpable ice slurries have heretofore been hampered by the limitations of the available compressor technology and by problems associated with the transportability of ice slurries. These factors led to the development and installation of a 3 MW(ref) vacuum ice machine in South Africa - the first of its kind - for application in the cooling of deep level gold mines. The process developed uses direct contact heat transfer in evaporation and condensation with water vapor as the sole refrigerant. The system employs a unique two stage centrifugal compressor system designed and developed specifically for large flow rates and high compression ratios. The vacuum compressor technology is an extension of existing technology based on the results of thirty years of development evolution in commercial seawater desalination systems. The present paper describes the technical characteristics of the machine recently developed for the above application and the equipment used to produce and transport concentrated ice slurries. The commercial use of the water vapor compression cycle for cooling or heating systems and for various potential industrial applications are described as well.",
1856,"Geological characteristics of strata in Chongqing, China, and mitigation of the environmental impacts of tunneling-induced geo-hazards This study investigated the geological characteristics of strata in Chongqing and the tunneling-induced geo-hazards therein. The urban area of Chongqing contains six syncline-anticline pairs and is bounded by the Huayingshan basement fault to the west and by the Changshou-Zunyi basement fault to the east. The bedrock, containing sandstone and mudstone of the Upper Shaximiao formation resulting from Middle Triassic strata, is occasionally outcropped. During urbanization, many valleys in Chongqing require to be backfilled to create more flat ground. Thus, the extent and thickness of the loose backfill layer varied from place to place. While tunneling in Chongqing, the following geological characteristics may cause geo-hazards: (1) backfill with a loose structure, poor gradation, high permeability, and large void ratio, (2) highly, or moderately weathered mudstone and sandstone that can easily become softened once subjected to groundwater seepage, and (3) syncline folding containing perched water or confined fissure water. The potential geo-hazards include groundwater ingress, ground surface settlement, and strata collapse. While tunneling within backfill synclines, sandstone synclines, or weak fractured rock, significant amount of groundwater may be encountered, thus leading to a high risk of groundwater ingress. Ground surface settlement can be triggered due to the disturbances of tunnel construction to the backfill or consolidation effect after groundwater ingress. Strata collapse can be caused by the blasting-induced disturbances to poor surrounding geology or by inadequate overburden thickness or by an increase in the effective stress resulting from groundwater loss caused by leakage. To mitigate the environmental impacts of the tunneling-induced geo-hazards, a series of countermeasures; that is, advance geological drilling, advance ground improvement including full-face grouting, and grouting of the surrounding geologic media, and advance pipe umbrella use, are proposed in this paper. The results from a case study indicate that the proposed countermeasures can greatly decrease the ground surface settlement and amount of groundwater ingress during tunneling in Chongqing verifying the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasures.",
1857,"Numerical Simulation of Counter-Flush System on Borehole Mining for Offshore Tin Mining PT. Timah Tbk., a local company in Indonesia, is developing a Borehole Mining (BHM) device for offshore tin mining to eliminate stripping overburden process. The mining process is done by drilling and spraying rocks using pressurized fluids to destroy rocks and produce a slurry which will then be distributed to the surface through the pipe. This BHM device has been tested and the result of field testing indicates that the device is not perform properly to deliver the slurry to the surface. This paper presents a numerical simulation to find out the factors causing the failure of the equipment being developed. Numerical analysis is done by making a numerical model of the BHM system. The result of the simulation shows that the design of the counter-flush system has not been properly designed and there is also an indication of insufficient pressure and/or debit of the main pump.",
1858,"Three-phase non-isothermal flow behavior of CO2-brine leakage from wellbores CO2 leakage from the subsurface is one of the major concerns in relation to CO2 sequestration in geological formations. In this study we propose a transient, three-phase non-isothermal flow model to describe the relevant CO2-water (brine) leakage process through a wellbore. The model is formulated on the basis of the T2WELL program by incorporating the ECO2M equation of state and a three-phase drift-flux model. Three case studies are presented for verification, validation, and application of the proposed CO2-leakage model. In case-1, an analytical solution is.derived as a limiting case of the present model, and it allows one to obtain an analytical insight into the flow profile when the leakage scenario is a two-phase steady one without phase transition. Comparison of this analytical solution with the relevant numerical solution shows that both are fully consistent. In case-2, we compare our numerical model with a classic Darcy-law-based CO2-leakage model, demonstrating that the latter one would generate significant deviations because of excluding the inertia effect. In case-3, we use the present model to simulate the potential CO2-leakage profile in the Ordos CO2-sequestration site (China), and demonstrate that very sophisticated flow scenarios could be created, in which three-phase co-existence regime could be present, and highly oscillating flow profile would occur. The temperature of the leaking fluid with high-concentration of CO2 may also drop dramatically because of the Joule-Thomson effect, even leading to formation of ice phase at the wellhead. Our model may be useful for evaluating the potential of CO2 leakage from wellbores, and for assessing the safety issues related to CO2 geological storage.",
1859,"Chemical and biological properties of honey from Thai stingless bee (Tetragonula leaviceps) Honey from stingless bees (Tetragonula laeviceps) was collected from Chantaburi and Trat provinces in Thailand where bees are kept for commercial honey production. The honey was studied for its physiochemical, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. For physiochemical analysis, compared to Apis mellifera honey, the honey samples collected from stingless bees were significantly greater in total moisture amount (26.98 +/- 0.23 g/100g), ash content (0.26 +/- 0.04 g/100g), pH (3.62 +/- 0.01), total acidity (81.37 +/- 0.55 meq/kg), electrical conductivity (0.62 +/- 0.00 mS/cm), and HMF (1.08 +/- 0.13 ppm), but no diastase activity could be detected. The sum of fructose and glucose was lower than 65% g/100g standards of A. mellifera honey, but sucrose was much higher. An agar well diffusion method was used to determine antimicrobial activities of the honey against fourteen species of bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes) and two species of yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The honey was found to inhibit the growth of thirteen species of bacteria except P. acnes and the two species of yeasts. The broth micro dilution method was used to assess the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of stingless bee honey. The scavenging activity of honey samples was determined by 2, 2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). It was found that the IC50 in the honey samples from Chantaburi and Trat province were 0.07 +/- 0.01 and 0.04 +/- 0.00 mg/ml, respectively.",
1860,"Petrology and sulfur and chlorine emissions of the 1963 eruption of Gunung Agung, Bali, Indonesia The 1963 eruption of Gunung Agung produced 0.95 km(3) dense rock equivalent (DRE) of olivine+/-hornblende-bearing, weakly phyric, basaltic andesite tephra and lava. Evidence for magma mixing in the eruptive products includes whole-rock compatible and incompatible trace element trends, reverse and complex compositional zoning of mineral phases, disequilibrium mineral assemblages, sieve-textured plagioclase phenocrysts, and augite rims on reversely zoned orthopyroxene. Basalt magma mixed with pre-existing andesite magma shortly before eruption to yield basaltic andesite with a temperature of 1040-1100 degrees C at an assumed pressure of 2 kb, fO(2)>NNO, and an average melt volatile content (H2O+/-CO2) of 4.3 wt.%. Magma-mixing end members may have provided some of the S and Cl emitted in the eruption. Glass inclusions in phenocrysts contain an average of 650 ppm S and 3130 ppm Cl as compared with 70 ppm and 2220 ppm, respectively, in the matrix glass. Maximum S and Cl contents of glass inclusions approach 1800 and 5000 ppm, respectively. Application of the petrologic method to products of the 1963 eruption for estimating volatile release yields of 2.5x10(12) g (Mt) of SO2 and 3.4 Mt of Cl released from the 0.65 km(3) of juvenile tephra which contributed to stratospheric injection of H2SO4 aerosols on 17 March and 16 May, when eruption column heights exceeded 20 km above sea level. An independent estimate of SO2 release from atmospheric aerosol loading (11-12Mt) suggests that approximately 7Mt of SO2 was injected into the stratosphere. The difference between the two estimates can be most readily accounted for by the partitioning of S, as well as some Cl, from the magma into a water-rich vapor phase which was released upon eruption. For other recent high-S-release eruptions of more evolved and oxidized magmas (El Chichon, Pinatubo), the petrologic method gives values two orders of magnitude less than independent estimates of SO2 emissions. Results from this study of the Agung 1963 magma and its volatile emissions, and from related studies on eruptions of more mafic magmas, suggest that SO2 emissions from eruptions of higher-S-solubility magma may be more reliably estimated by the petrologic method than may those from more-evolved magma eruptions.",
1861,"Toxic risk assessment and environmental contamination of heavy metals around abandoned metal mine sites in Korea In order to investigate the levels of heavy metal contamination and to assess the risk of the adverse health effects on human exposure to toxic heavy metals influenced by past mining activities, environmental geochemical surveys were undertaken around abandoned metal mine sites (Okdong Cu-Pb-Zn, Dokok Au-Ag-Cu and Hwacheon Au-Ag-Pb-Zn mines). High concentrations of heavy metals were found in tailings from the Okdong (72 As mg/kg, 53.6 Cd mg/kg, 910 Cu mg/kg, 1,590 Pb mg/kg, 5,720 Zn mg/kg), the Dokok (254 As mg/kg, 98.2 Cd mg/kg, 2,550 Cu mg/kg, 4,200 Pb mg/kg, 18,020 Zn mg/kg) and the Hwacheon (72 As mg/kg, 12.4 Cd mg/kg, 580 Pb mg/kg, 1,300 Zn mg/kg) mines. Elevated levels of As, Cd, Pb and Zn were also found in agricultural soils from these mine areas. Human risk effects are classified into a cancer effect and a toxic (noncancer) effect. The hazard index representing a toxic risk for As was higher value than 1.0 in the Okdong and the Hwacheon mine sites, as was that for Cd in the Okdong and Dokok mine sites. Therefore, toxic risks for As and Cd exist via exposure (ingestion) to the contaminated soil, groundwater and rice grains in these mine areas. The cancer risk for As by the consumption of groundwater used as drinking water from the Okdong and the Hwacheon mine areas was 7E-4 and 1E-4, respectively. These risk levels exceed the acceptable risk (1 in 100,000) for regulatory purposes.",
1862,"Biogas Compression and Storage System for Cooking Applications in Rural Households A project is undertaken by the College of Engineering Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India to design and develop a biogas production, purification, compression and storage system suitable for the use as a cooking gas in rural households.

1864,"Micromorph brachiopods from the late Asbian (Mississippian, Visean) from northwest Ireland (Gleniff, County Sligo) A diverse assemblage of minute brachiopods is reported from the Visean (late Asbian) Meenymore Formation exposed in the Gleniff outlier, County Sligo, northwest Ireland. The assemblage includes 14 micromorph species and juveniles of larger species, in which spire-hearers (Athyridida. Spiriferida and Spiriferinida) are the most diverse. Most of the species are left in open nomenclature as only few specimens show internal features. However, a new species of the uncommon orthotetide Drahanorhynchus (D. gleniffensis sp. nov.), previously known from the Mississippian of the Czech Republic, Spain and Germany, is described. In addition, the lectotype of the athyridide Hustedia nudtiplicata ((IC Koninck, 1887), from the Tournaisian of Tournai (Belgium) is selected and illustrated photographically for the first time. The brachiopods from Gleniff are associated with other small-sized benthic organisms particularly echinoderms and molluscs (gastropods, rostroconchs). The environmental factors, which lead to the small size, are not clearly understood although they probably included a combination of biological (e.g. food supply) and physicochemical (e.g. water oxygenation) parameters. Salinity is probably not implicated because brachiopods and echinoderms are generally stenohaline.",
1865,"Community-based control of Aedes aegypti by adoption of eco-health methods in Chennai City, India Background: Dengue is highly endemic in Chennai city, South India, in spite of continuous vector control efforts. This intervention study was aimed at establishing the efficacy as well as the favouring and limiting factors relating to a community-based environmental intervention package to control the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was designed to measure the outcome of a new vector control package and process analysis; different data collection tools were used to determine the performance. Ten randomly selected intervention clusters (neighbourhoods with 100 houses each) were paired with ten control clusters on the basis of ecological/entomological indices and sociological parameters collected during baseline studies. In the intervention clusters, Aedes control was carried out using a community-based environmental management approach like provision of water container covers through community actors, clean-up campaigns, and dissemination of dengue information through schoolchildren. The main outcome measure was reduction in pupal indices (pupae per person index), used as a proxy measure of adult vectors, in the intervention clusters compared to the control clusters. Results: At baseline, almost half the respondents did not know that dengue is serious but preventable, or that it is transmitted by mosquitoes. The stakeholder analysis showed that dengue vector control is carried out by vertically structured programmes of national, state, and local administrative bodies through fogging and larval control with temephos, without any involvement of community-based organizations, and that vector control efforts were conducted in an isolated and irregular way. The most productive container types for Aedes pupae were cement tanks, drums, and discarded containers. All ten intervention clusters with a total of 1000 houses and 4639 inhabitants received the intervention while the ten control clusters with a total of 1000 houses and 4439 inhabitants received only the routine government services and some of the information education and communication project materials. The follow-up studies showed that there was a substantial increase in dengue understanding in the intervention group with only minor knowledge changes in the control group. Community involvement and the partnership among stakeholders (particularly women's self-help groups) worked well. After 10 months of intervention, the pupae per person index was significantly reduced to 0.004 pupae per person from 1.075 (P=0.020) in the intervention clusters compared to control clusters. There were also significant reductions in the Stegomyia indices: the house index was reduced to 4.2%, the container index to 1.05%, and the Breteau index to 4.3 from the baseline values of 19.6, 8.91, and 30.8 in the intervention arm. Conclusion: A community-based approach together with other stakeholders that promoted interventions to prevent dengue vector breeding led to a substantial reduction in dengue vector density.",
1866,"Application of multi-criteria decision making methods in slope stability analysis of open pit mines Rock slope instabilities are a major hazard for human activities often causing economic losses, property damages and maintenance costs, as well as injuries or fatalities. For slope stability analysis of open pit mines, series of studies must be carried out in order to identify the criteria which should take into consideration. In this research geotechnical parameters; Geological Strength Index (GSI), Rock Quality Designation (RQD), Cohesion (C), angle of internal friction (phi), uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and Rock mass deformation modulus (E (m) ) which are obtained from data measured within geotechnical boreholes and pore pressure (U) are considered as the criteria to evaluate stability of pit No.1 of the Gole Gohar iron mine, located in Kerman province, south east of Iran. Since human judgments and preferences are often vague and complex and decision makers cannot estimate their preferences with an exact scale, we can only give linguistic assessments instead of exact ones. So fuzzy set theory introduced into Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) is put forward to solve such uncertain problems. In this paper, FAHP method is used to determine the weights of the criteria by decision makers and then classification of the stability of blocks are determined by TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method by the shortest distance to positive ideal solution (PIS) and the longest distance to negative ideal solution (NIS).",
1867,"Dethiosulfovibrio peptidovorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a new anaerobic, slightly halophilic, thiosulfate-reducing bacterium from corroding offshore oil wells A strictly anaerobic thiosulfate-reducing bacterium was isolated from a corroding offshore oil well in Congo and was designated strain SEBR 4207T. Pure culture of the strain induced a very active pitting corrosion of mild steel, with penetration rates of up to 4 mm per year. This constitutes the first experimental evidence of the involvement of thiosulfate reduction in microbial corrosion of steel. Strain SEBR 4207T cells were vibrios (3 to 5 by 1 microns), stained gram negative, and possessed lateral flagella. Spores were not detected. Optimum growth occurred in the presence of 3% NaCl at pH 7.0 and 42 degrees C. Strain SEBR 4207T utilized peptides and amino acids, but not sugars or fatty acids. It fermented serine, histidine, and Casamino Acids, whereas arginine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, valine, methionine, and asparagine were only used in the presence of thiosulfate. Peptides were fermented to acetate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, 2-methylbutyrate, H2, and CO2. The addition of either thiosulfate or sulfur but not sulfate increased peptide utilization, growth rate, and biomass; during growth, H2S was produced and a concomitant decrease in H2 was observed. The addition of either thiosulfate or sulfur also reversed H2 inhibition. 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicates that strain SEBR 4207T is distantly related to members of the genus Thermoanaerobacter (83% similarity). Because the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics cannot be assigned to any described genus, strain SEBR 4207T is designated as a new species of a new genus, Dethiosulfovibrio peptidovorans gen. nov., sp. nov. Strain SEBR 4207T has been deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und zellkulturen GmbH (= DSM 11002).",
1868,"Middle Stone Age starch acquisition in the Niassa Rift, Mozambique The quest for direct lines of evidence for Paleolithic plant consumption during the African Middle Stone Age has led scientists to study residues and use-wear on flaked stone tools. Past work has established lithic function through multiple lines of evidence and the spatial breakdown of use-wear and microscopic traces on tool surfaces. This paper focuses on the quantitative analysis of starch assemblages and the botanical identification of grains from flake and core tools to learn about human ecology of carbohydrate use around the Niassa woodlands, in the Mozambican Rift. The processing of starchy plant parts is deduced from the Occurrence of starch assemblages that presumably got attached to stone tool surfaces by actions associated with extractive or culinary activities. Specifically., we investigate starch grains from stone tools recently excavated in northern Mozambique at the site of Mikuyu; which presumably spans the middle to late Pleistocene and represents similar sites found along the Malawi/Niassa corridor that links East, Southern, and Central Africa. Starch was extracted and processed with a diverse tool kit consisting of scrapers, cores, points, flakes, and other kinds of tools. The microbotanical data suggests consumption of seeds, legumes, caryopses, piths. underground storage organs, nuts, and mesocarps from more than a dozen Families. Our data Suggest a great antiquity for starch use in Africa as well as an expanded diet and intensification. (C) 2008 University of Washington. All rights reserved.",
1869,"PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL TREATMENTS FOR THE CONTROL OF Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis IN CASSAVA SEEDS Cassava seeds of the landrace TME1 collected from Nigeria were vacuum-infiltrated with Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam) marker strain GSPB 2511 (10(8) cells/ml). The inoculated seeds were subjected to different temperatures of water and air as well as alcohol treatment. Thermal treatment with water at 50 degrees C to 60 degrees C for 30 min resulted in 100% mortality of the pathogen without affecting the germination rate compared to untreated seeds. Thermal treatment by hot air at 65 degrees C for 4 days reduced the bacterial population without affecting the germination rate of treated seeds. Furthermore, soaking infected seeds in 70% ethanol, Xam was re-isolated leading to the conclusion that alcohol treatment may not be 100% effective to control the pathogen in seeds. Seed treatments by hot water or by air are the recommendable means to control Xam in cassava seeds.",
1870,"Removal effects of Myriophyllum aquaticum on combined pollutants of nutrients and heavy metals in simulated swine wastewater in summer Swine wastewater (SW) treatment by Myriophyllum aquaticum is an important biotechnology for its resource utilization. However, some knowledge gaps remain in compound-pollutant removal in SW, especially in practical applications. To clarify the responses of M. aquaticum to the compound pollutants as well as the related operational parameters in SW treatment, three initial doses (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5Â kg per pond in 150Â L simulated SW) of M. aquaticum and a control (no plant; CK) were allocated to 12 ponds under a plastic roof in Nanjing city of Eastern China during 75 days in the summer of 2019. Results showed that M. aquaticum could be used as a pioneer plant to efficiently remove compounded pollutants of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and especially for heavy metals in simulated SW. Compared with CK, M. aquaticum assisted in improving the total N, NH(4)(+)-N, NO(3)(-)-N, NO(2)(-)-N, and dissolved organic N by 30.1%, 100%, 100%, 97.6%, 20.2%, 39.8% whereas Cu, Zn, and Cd by 50.4%, 36.4% and 47.9% on average during the 75-day experiment in summer, respectively. Moreover, concentrations of Cu and Cd at day 75 were in the ranges of 1.92-2.82 and 0.64-1.47Â gÂ kg(-1) DW, respectively, exceeding the corresponding limits of the heavy-metal hyperaccumulator. For the operational parameters, the optimized initial dose was 1.0Â kg per pond with M. aquaticum harvested after 45 summer days, respectively. Given that M. aquaticum has been widely used as animal feed in recent years and limit values for Cu and Zn in animal feed are not set in China, the toxicities of Cu and Zn should be assessed and the guideline of their limit values needs to be established for safe feed production. Interestingly, NH(4)(+)-N could dominate the removal of heavy metals especially Cd in the simulated SW, however, related mechanisms are needed for further study.",
1871,"Quantification of free and conjugated abscisic acid in five genotypes of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under water stress conditions The goal of the present study was to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying drought stress adaptations in barley plants. For this purpose we evaluated changes in endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and its glucose ester conjugate (ABAGE), as well as changes in proline content, water relations and growth parameters of five barley genotypes with different drought resistance characteristics. Different responses among the five genotypes studied (Ardahoui, Pakistan, Rihane, Manel ad Roho) led to changes in their pattern of growth and development under drought conditions. Water stress induced a reduction in relative water content, as well as an increase in proline content and endogenous ABA concentrations in all tested genotypes. The lack of water led to a 2-fold increase in proline content for var. Rihane and to a 5-fold increase in endogenous ABA for cv. Ardhaoui. Also, increases in endogenous ABAGE in all genotypes except for cv. Ardhaoui were observed. Our results show that changes in ABA and ABAGE correlated with variations in proline content and growth parameters of these genotypes which present different mechanisms to cope with water stress. We also suggest that new regulatory mechanisms implying ABA mobilization can be of great importance in adaptation of barley to drought. (C) 2010 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1872,"Treatment of Saline Water Using Electrocoagulation with Combined Electrical Connection of Electrodes Saline water treatment has become increasingly important for drinking water supplies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the electrocoagulation (EC) process with combined aluminum electrodes in removing various types of salt from water samples collected at Sawa Lake, Al-Muthanna, Iraq. The targeted types of salt include total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride salt (Cl-), bromine (Br-), and sulphate (SO42-). A bench scale consisting of combined EC configurations with static electrodes was employed under combined electrical connections. The effect of the six variables factors, such as applied current density (I), reaction time (RT), pH, temperature (T), stirring speed (M-rpm) and inter electrode distance (IED) were observed to achieve a higher removal of TDS, Cl-, Br- and SO42-. Initial results showed the following optimum operating conditions: I = 2 mA/cm(2), RT = 80 min, pH = 8, T = 25 degrees C, IED = 1 cm and M-rpm = 500. The maximum removal efficiency of TDS, Cl-, Br- and SO42- were 91%, 93%, 92% and 90%, respectively. It can be concluded that the EC method applied in the present study was effective to removing salts from lake water.",
1873,"[Mechanism of Algal Community Dynamics Driven by the Seasonal Water Bacterial Community in a Stratified Drinking Water Reservoir] Phytoplankton and bacteria are crucial components of aquatic food webs, playing critical roles in the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems. However, there are few studies on how the algal and bacterial communities interact and respond to changing environmental conditions in the water reservoirs. Thus, the ecological interaction relationship between the temporal succession of the phytoplankton community and the bacterial community was investigated using 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing and a co-occurrence network in the Lijiahe Reservoir. The results showed that Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta were also dominant taxa in the phytoplankton community. In August, Cyanobacteria replaced Bacillariophyta as the second-most dominant taxa, with an average relative abundance of 30.13%. DNA sequencing showed that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated throughout the year. Proteobacteria reached a maximum relative abundance of 71.68% in July. Acidobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus, which were rare taxa, reached maximum relative abundances of 10.20% and 5.56%, respectively. The co-occurrence network showed that the association between algae and bacteria was mainly positive, indicating that the interaction between them may be dominated by mutualism. As a keystone taxa, Methylotenera was significantly and positively related to Chlorella. Scenedesmus was also a keystone taxa and was significantly and negatively correlated with various bacteria, such as Methylobacter, Solitalea, and Rhodoferax. An RDA analysis showed that the succession of algal and bacterial communities was significantly regulated by water temperature, pH, and conductivity, and the environmental factors explained 93.1% and 90% of the variation in the algal community and bacterial community, respectively. The results will provide a scientific basis for exploring the micro-ecological driving mechanism of the interaction between algae and bacteria in deep drinking water reservoir ecosystems.",
1874,"Risk factors for high blood lead levels among the general population in Taiwan Purpose. Environmental and occupational lead pollution is a common problem in both developing and industrialized countries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk factors for high blood lead levels among the general population in Taiwan. Methods. After multi-stage sampling, we randomly selected 2803 subjects (1471 males and 1332 females) for this study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the risk of high blood lead. To control for differences in age and gender, all analyses were with age- adjusted and gender-stratified. Results. Among males, the mean age is 46 years (15 to 85 years), mean and median blood lead levels is 7.3 and 6.3 mu g/dl, respectively. Among females, the mean age is 43 years (15 to 84 years), mean and median blood lead level is 5.7 and 4.8 mu g/dl, respectively. Among males, the history of herbal drug use, drinking water from well or spring sources, and occupational lead exposure are significantly different between relatively high and normal blood lead level subjects. The history of occupational lead exposure, history of herbal drug use, and well or spring sources of drinking water are the major risk factors for high blood lead with odds patio of 4.62 (95% CI: 2.82-7.55), 3.09 (95% CI: 1.6-5.97), 2.06 (95% CI: 1.13-3.76), and 2.37 (95% CI: 1.39-4.04), respectively. Among females, these characteristics remain important except the sources of drinking water. The history of herbal drug use and occupational lead exposure become the major risk factors for high blood lead with odds ratio of 2.94 (95% CI: 1.26-6.88) and 7.72 (95% CI: 3.51-16.99), respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, we find that the risk factors for high blood lead in both genders include a history of herbal drug use and occupational lead exposure. Among males, the drinking water sources and factories in the neighboring areas are also significant factors for high blood lead. Conclusions. For the goal of reducing prevalence of high blood lead by the year 2000, the improvement and monitoring of the working environment, the careful attention to herbal drug use and the lead-free drinking water sources should be executed as thoroughly as possible to reduce the probability of lead pollution.",
1875,"Neoproterozoic Rosetta Gabbro from northernmost Arabian-Nubian Shield, south Jordan: Geochemistry and petrogenesis An Ediacaran mafic intrusion of south Jordan is a distinctive appinitic igneous rock with a possibly unique texture, characterized by spherical clots up to 40 mm in diameter composed of amphibole cores from which plagioclase euhedra radiate; we call it the Rosetta Gabbro. It is exposed as a small (ca. 750 m(2)) outcrop in the Neoproterozoic basement of south Jordan. A second outcrop of otherwise similar gabbro is located about 400 m to the north of the Rosetta Gabbro, but it lacks the distinctive texture. The Rosetta Gabbro could represent a magma pipe. It intrudes the Aqaba Complex (similar to 600 Ma) granitoids and metasediments of the Janub Metamorphic Complex (633-617 Ma). The gabbro is an 01- to QZ tholeiite with the following chemical characteristics: SiO2 = 46.2-47.8 wt.%; Al2O3 = 16.4-17.7 wt.%, TiO2 = 1.70-2.82 wt.%, Na2O = 1.27-2.83 wt.%. K2O = 0.82-1.63 wt.%; Mg# 58-63; Sigma REE = 70-117 ppm; La/Yb similar to 6 to 8; and Eu/Eu* = 1.05-1.2. The investigated gabbro has the geochemical features of a continental flood tholeiitic basalt emplaced in a within-plate tectonic setting. Two varieties of amphiboles are found: 1) large, 3-5 mm, brown ferri-titanian-tschermakite K0.09Na0.28) (Na020Ca1.80) (Mn0.04Fe1.13+Mg2.34Fe0.902+Ti029Al0.22)(Al-1.Si-85(6.15))O-22(OH)(1.95) of the calcic amphibole group which is riddled with opaques; and 2) acicular yellowish-light green ferrian-magnesiohomblende (K0.04Na0.153)(Ca1.755Na0245) (Fe(0.66)(3+)Mn(0.01)Fe(1.01)(2+)mg(3.03)Ti(0.06)Al(0.22))(Al1.03Si6.97)O-22(OH)1.95. Scattered flakes of phlogopite also occur. Tabular radiating plagioclase (An(64-79)) are complexly twinned, with broad lamellae that show no zoning. Laser-ablation ICP-MS analyses of amphibole and plagioclase reveal considerable variation in trace element abundance, in spite of more subtle major element variations except for TiO2 in amphibole. The REE in the amphibole shows an order of magnitude variation with a concave-downward pattern and a positive Eu anomaly Eu/Eu* = 0.6-2, though far less pronounced compared to the Eu/Eu* = 5-45 of plagioclase. The 3D dandelion-like texture of the rosettas is broadly similar to ""Chrysanthemum Stone"", which is a diagenetic growth in sedimentary rock, but we can find no description of similar textures in igneous rocks. The formation of the rosettas is thought to reflect loss of magmatic water resulting in supersaturation of plagioclase, which grew rapidly around amphibole and may havelloated in the magma. This implies magmatic evolution in shallow (10 to 12 km deep) crust where temperatures were nevertheless in the range of ca. 750 to 900 degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
1876,"Tensions between Formal and Informal Water Providers: Receptivity toward Mechanised Boreholes in the Sunyani West District, Ghana Sustainable Development Goal 6 seeks universal access to safe water. This is ambitious, especially for developing countries, and meeting it will require reliance on informal water suppliers alongside traditional formal suppliers. We adopt a case study approach to explore water production in Ghana's Sunyani West District. We observe that privately managed mechanised boreholes have become a major source of water in the district, in terms of the number of people they serve and the fact that they are successful in serving them. However, water users and formal water providers have different perceptions of these boreholes. This tension between formal and informal providers needs to be resolved and one possible way is through formalisation of the informal services. We propose a hybrid model for water governance by the District Authority and argue that this governance arrangement will formalise the operations of the informal mechanised boreholes and reflect the intimate co-production of water between the formal suppliers and the emerging informal providers in the district.",
1877,"Arsenic and Other Geogenic Contaminants in Groundwater - A Global Challenge Groundwater is a much safer and more dependable source of drinking water than surface water. However, natural (geogenic) hazardous elements can contaminate groundwater and lead to severe health problems in consumers. Arsenic concentrations exceeding the WHO drinking water guideline of 10 mu g/L globally affect over 220 million people and can cause arsenicosis (skin lesions and cancers). Fluoride, while preventing caries at low concentrations, has detrimental effects when above the WHO drinking water guideline of 1.5 mg/L and puts several hundred million people at risk of dental and skeletal fluorosis. In this article, we report on the geochemistry and occurrence of arsenic and fluoride in groundwater and on the development of global and regional risk maps that help alert governments and water providers to take appropriate mitigation measures for the provision of safe drinking water. We then summarize research on the removal of arsenic and fluoride from drinking water, focusing on adapted technologies for water treatment. Finally, we discuss the applicability of various measures in a larger context and future challenges in reaching the goal of access to safe drinking water for all.",
1878,"Assessment of drinking water contamination in food stalls of Jashore Municipality, Bangladesh This study aimed to determine the quality of drinking water supplied in different types of food stalls in Jashore Municipality, Bangladesh. A total of 35 water samples were collected from different tea stalls, street side fast food stalls, normal restaurants and well-furnished restaurants. The water quality was evaluated by determining the distinct physical, chemical and biological parameters. The results revealed that the water used in the food stalls and restaurants for drinking purpose was in desired quality in terms of turbidity, electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), phosphate (PO43-), chloride (Cl-), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) concentrations. The values were within the permissible limit proposed by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and the World Health Organization. Concentrations of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) found in several samples were higher than the World Health Organization standard. Iron (Fe) concentrations were higher than the permissible limit of the World Health Organization. Only 46% exceeded the permissible limit of Bangladesh Bureau Statistics. The threatening result was that the samples were contaminated by fecal coliform, indicating that the people of Jashore Municipality may have a greater chance of being affected by pathogenic bacteria. The drinking water provided in the street side fast food stalls was biologically contaminated. The findings demonstrate that the drinking water used in food stalls and restaurants of Jashore Municipality did not meet up the potable drinking water quality standards and therefore was detrimental to public health.",
1879,"Forecast and optimal allocation of production, living and ecology water consumption in Zhangye, China The water crisis is one of three crises that are persecuting the world. China is among the countries that face severe water shortages. Water scarcity and water pollution have seriously affected China's sustainable development in terms of the economy and society. Water resources per capita of China is only one quarter of the wdrld's average. In addition, about 70 percent of China's rivers, lakes, and reservoirs are affected by pollution. Due to limited water resources, a crucial issue for the sustainable development of the watershed is how to resolve the 'human/nature competition for water and how to achieve the coordinated development of the economy, society and ecology. On the basis of defining water consumption for production, living,and ecology (WPLE), this paper proposes a""framework for forecasting and optimally allocating WPLE. Using Zhangye, in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin as the case study area, we forecasted and optimally allocated WPLE under three development scenarios, i.e. the conventional development scenario (CDS), the economy-priority development scenario (EPDS) and the environmentally sustainable development scenario (ESDS). In 2010, the proportions of WPLE in Zhangye were 87.73%, 2.74% and 9.53%, respectively. In 2020, the proportions of WPLE will be 74.80%, 4.50% and 20.70% under the CDS, 76.16%, 5.27% and 18.57% under the EPDS, and 74.99%, 4.51% and 20.50% under the ESDS. In the future, the proportion of production water consumption of Zhangye will drastically decrease, while the proportion of ecological water consumption will significantly increase. The main contradiction of the co-evolution of WPLE of Zhangye is the competitiveness of production and living water consumption with ecological water consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1880,"Radiance-based retrieval bias mitigation for the MOPITT instrument: the version 8 product The MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere) satellite instrument has been making nearly continuous observations of atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) since 2000. Satellite observations of CO are routinely used to analyze emissions from fossil fuels and biomass burning, as well as the atmospheric transport of those emissions. Recent enhancements to the MOPITT retrieval algorithm have resulted in the release of the version 8 (V8) product. V8 products benefit from updated spectroscopic data for water vapor and nitrogen used to develop the operational radiative transfer model and exploit a new method for minimizing retrieval biases through parameterized radiance bias correction. In situ datasets used for algorithm development and validation include the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations) datasets used for earlier MOPITT validation work in addition to measurements from the ACRIDICON-CHUVA (Aerosol, Cloud, Precipitation, and Radiation Interactions and Dynamics of Convective Cloud Systems - Cloud processes of the main precipitation systems in Brazil: A contribution to cloud resolving modeling and to the GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement)), KORUS-AQ (The Korea-United States Air Quality Study), and ATom (The Atmospheric Tomography Mission) programs. Validation results illustrate clear improvements with respect to long-term bias drift and geographically variable retrieval bias. For example, whereas bias drift for the V7 thermal-infrared (TIR)-only product exceeded 0.5 % yr(-1) for levels in the upper troposphere (e.g., at 300 hPa), bias drift for the V8 TIR-only product is found to be less than 0.1 % yr(-1) at all levels. Also, whereas upper-tropospheric (300 hPa) retrieval bias in the V7 TIR-only product exceeded 10 % in the tropics, corresponding V8 biases are less than 5 % (in terms of absolute value) at all latitudes and do not exhibit a clear latitudinal dependence.",
1881,"Observational Study on Stratiform Cloud Structure and its Condition of Artificial Rain-increasing Based on Observations of TRMM Satellite, Surface radar and Aircraft The stratiform cloud is the prevailing precipitating system and the most important seeding subject in North China during spring and autumn. The acquisition of complex integrative information on the complicated multi-scale structures through planned observation and retrieval is the key to the analysis of cloud structure and seeking of the suitable seeding portions. Using TRMM-aboard TMI and PR soundings, ground-based radar as well as planned aircraft cloud physical measurements, an observational study is made of meso and micro scale structures of the stratiform clouds related to a cold front - lower-level trough in northern Henan and a warm inverted trough - cyclone in southern Henan appearing on April 11, 1999 over central China, arriving at the following conclusions: 1) The steady rainfall field is homogeneous in structure, on the whole, leading to precipitation at <1 mm/h and embedded in the uniform structure are strong rain belts, 5-10 km wide and nearly 50 km long. In southern Henan, the rainfall field is heterogeneous, generally with precipitation between 1 to 10 mm/h and more than one (>10 mm/h) rain mass embedded inside. 2) The 3D structure stratiform rainfall field contains discontinuous rain towers similar to those in the case of convective precipitation except its connected cloud base and its top undulating to varying degree. 3) Hydrometeors are distributed unevenly in the cold front cloud, and precipitation water is between surface to 5.5 km level. Cloud ice mainly above 5 km level, and the big-value zones of cloud water in the mid to upper cloud, part being 2 km above the 00C layer where supercooled water is observed. These masses of cloud water suspended in the cloud suggest that the natural conversion from cloud water to precipitation water is incomplete but they serve as the principal water source for seeding. 4) During the different stages of the cold front, the large-valued cloud water content is observed, both at 2500 and 4800 m level. In the early stage water content is plentiful at the lower level and in the later stage supercooled water becomes rich in the upper level, whose position drops to some extent as the cloud further develops. The suitable micro-physical conditions (concentration of cloud particles and cloud water content) are distributed considerably unevenly, which requires real-time monitoring for seeding to achieve expected catalysis effect.",
1882,"Determination of the Microbial and Chemical Loads in Rivers from the Quito Capital Province of Ecuador (Pichincha)-A Preliminary Analysis of Microbial and Chemical Quality of the Main Rivers Contamination of natural water sources is one of the main health problems worldwide, which could be caused by chemicals, metals, or microbial agents. This study aimed to analyze the quality of 18 rivers located in Quito, the capital province of Pichincha, Ecuador, through physico-chemical and microbial parameters. TheE. coliand total coliforms assessments were performed by a counting procedure in growth media. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was realized to detect several microbial genera, as well asCandida albicans, two parasites (CryptosporidiumandGiardiaspp.) andE. colipathotypes: enterohemorrhagicE. coli(EHEC), enteroaggregativeE. coli(EAEC), enteroinvasiveE. coli(EIEC) and enteropathogenicE. coli(EPEC). Additionally, physico-chemical parameters and major and trace metals were analyzed in each surface water sample. Our results demonstrated that most of the rivers analyzed do not comply with the microbial, physico-chemical, and metal requirements established by the Ecuadorian legislation. In terms of microbial pollution, the most polluted rivers were Monjas, Machangara, Pisque, and Pita Rivers. Furthermore, three out of four analyzedE. colipathotypes (EIEC, EHEC, and EAEC) were detected in certain rivers, specifically: Monjas River showed the presence of EIEC and EHEC; in the Machangara River, EAEC and EIEC were detected; and finally, EIEC was present in the Guayllabamba River. Several physico-chemical parameters, such as pH, CODtotal, and TSS values, were higher than the Ecuadorian guidelines in 11, 28, and 28% of the rivers, respectively. Regarding heavy metals, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Mn surpassed the established values in 94, 89, 61, 22, 22, and 17% of the rivers, respectively. Machangara River was the only one that registered higher Cr concentrations than the national guidelines. The values of Al and Fe were above the recommended values in 83 and 72% of the rivers. Overall, based on the physical-chemical and microbiological parameters the most contaminated rivers were Machangara and Monjas. This study revealed severe contaminations in Ecuadorean Rivers; further studies should evaluate the sources of contamination and their impact on public health.",
1883,"The risk of arsenic induced skin lesions in Bangladeshi men and women is affected by arsenic metabolism and the age at first exposure It is known that a high fraction of methylarsonate (MA) in urine is a risk modifying factor for several arsenic induced health effects, including skin lesions, and that men are more susceptible for developing skin lesions than women. Thus, we aimed at elucidating the interaction between gender and arsenic metabolism for the risk of developing skin lesions. This study is part of a population-based case-referent study concerning the risk for skin lesions in relation to arsenic exposure via drinking water carried out in Matlab, a rural area 53km south-east of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We randomly selected 526 from 1579 referents and all 504 cases for analysis of arsenic metabolites in urine using HPLC coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-HG-ICPMS). The present study confirm previous studies, with the risk for skin lesions being almost three times higher in the highest tertile of %MA (adjusted OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.9-4.2, p < 0.001) compared to the lowest tertile. The present study is the first to show that the well documented higher risk for men to develop arsenic-related skin lesions compared to women is mainly explained by the less efficient methylation of arsenic, as defined by a higher fraction of MA and lower fraction of DMA in the urine, among men. Our previously documented lower risk for skin lesions in individuals exposed since infancy, or before, was found to be independent of the observed arsenic methylation efficiency. Thus, it can be speculated that this is due to a programming effect of arsenic in utero. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
1884,"[Research on the sensitivity of geochemical of underground river in Chongqing Xueyu Cave] Quoted geochemical susceptivity index and isosensitive line on geochemical susceptivity, analyzed the data of underground rivers of Xueyu Cave in Chongqing from September 2010 to August 2011, we found that the chemical composition of the underground river was controlled by the bedrock, due to the composition of high concentration of Ca2+ and low concentration of Mg2+. Owing to the effects of the monsoon, water chemistry was different between drought season and rainy season: the value of [Mg2+]/[Ca2+] was 0.018-0.051 in the rainy season, but in dry season the value was 0.038-0.064. The value of [HCO3(-)]/[SO4(2-)] was 4.86-36.62 in the rainy season, and 6.23-46.67 in the dry season. The seasonal change of Karstification made Ca2+ and HCO3(-) become the most sensitive ion. As a result of the special hydrogeological structure in Karat area, rain, surface water and groundwater transformed rapidly, which caused the underground river was sensitive to agricultural activities, especially for Cl- and NO3(-), and their sensitive indices were 0.286 and 0.022 respectively. The influence of tourism activities on the underground river was less than the management. The management work of ecological system should be strengthen in the recharge area, thus the largest economic and environmental benefits in the Karst area could be achieved.",
1885,"Socio-economic profile and profitability of faecal sludge emptying companies Given the rapid demographic growth, developing countries are increasingly facing difficulties in meeting the sanitation needs of their populations. Various strategies, such as on-site sanitation, have therefore been developed to improve and facilitate access of urban dwellers to effective liquid waste management mechanisms. These sanitation facilities used by about one-third of the world population are increasingly seen as the alternative towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However, this type of sanitation generates huge quantities of faecal sludge to be extracted and treated or conveyed to appropriate disposal sites. These important tasks are carried out by private operators whose organisational and operational structures are not always well understood. Due to their important link to on-site sanitation, the profile and profitability of these companies need to be defined to keep on-site sanitation costs under control. The case study conducted in the city of Dakar, Senegal - a typical example of a large city in developing countries - reveals that companies involved in domestic faecal sludge emptying can evolve both within a formal and informal framework. In most cases (68%), as these companies only own one vacuum tanker, they can hardly make a profit if their services merely offer domestic faecal sludge emptying. Investments in other market opportunities, such as cleaning of sewerage networks or industrial emptying, have allowed these companies to reach a rate of return upwards of 20% with the use of one or several trucks. This diversification could lead to a 32% drop in emptying fees and to a 19% rate of return, which can be improved by optimising the emptying equipment and enhancing the organisational structure of the faecal sludge management system.

1886,"Structural control of uranium mineralization at the Dominique-Peter deposit, Saskatchewan, Canada The Dominique-Peter deposit is part of a cluster of unconformity-related uranium deposits that have been exploited since 1980 at the Cluff Lake mine in northern Saskatchewan. It is located on the south side of the 18-km basement core of the 39-km diameter circular Carswell structure. The metamorphic basement cylinder has risen at least 1,200 m through the Mesoproterozoic sandstones. Underground structural study at Dominique-Peter resulted in a revision of the understanding of the succession of tectonic events controlling mineralization emplacement and deformation. The main premineralization ductile deformation, D-1 and D-2 produced a flat-lying gneissosity and subsequent development of foliation-conformable mylonites, and exhibits ! some contrasts with the eastern Athabasca Trans-Hudsonian tectonics. East-west to northwest-southeast general extension (ca. 1.3 Ga) resulted in the formation of a set of 015 degrees to 050 degrees listric normal faults. The latter controlled the opening of quartz then uraninite veins and induced a general tilting of fault blocks to the east. Mechanisms of mineralization emplacement are described in detail. Foliation reactivation in mylonite and aluminous gneiss is favorable to vein opening. The postmineralization formation of the Carswell circular structure (ca. 480 Ma) displays a centrifugal deformation with asymmetry axis located in the center of the basement dome. A suite of pseudotachylyte veins, breccias, and shatter cones accompanies this deformation. Overall, geometry of the Carswell dome and surrounding rings as well as the nature of associated breccias presents strong similarities with those of other impact-related structures.",
1887,"Hydraulic conductivity across bedding planes: A critical control on conjunctive-use management in Albuquerque, New Mexico Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA, lies above, and has produced its entire water supply from, a valley-fill aquifer more than 1,000 m thick and hydraulically connected with the Rio Grande. Water-management decisions have assumed the aquifer to be a continuous body of permeable material, recharged freely by the river; its ability to supply water was thought limited only by availability of water in the river. Water-level hydrographs now show the aquifer to be a sequence of semi-confined zones; pumping has led to head differences of more than 16 m between producing zones and the water table, in about 35 years. Model studies show recharge occurs at lower rates than expected, and is strongly dependent on irrigation. Supply from ground water alone is now known not to be sustainable, partly because of potential subsidence problems; this compels major change in urban planning, and water-rights administration in the Rio Grande Basin.",
1888,"Epidemiologic Impacts in Acute Infectious Disease Associated with Catastrophic Climate Events Related to Global Warming in the Northeast of Mexico Rising global temperatures and seawater temperatures have led to an increase in extreme weather patterns leading to droughts and floods. These natural phenomena, in turn, affect the supply of drinking water in some communities, which causes an increase in the prevalence of diseases related to the supply of drinking water. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the effects of global warming on human health in the population of Monterrey, Mexico after Hurricane Alex. We interpolated data using statistical downscaling of climate projection data for 2050 and 2080 and correlated it with disease occurrence. We found a remarkable rise in the incidence of transmissible infectious disease symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms predominated and were associated with drinking of contaminated water like tap water or water from communal mobile water tanks, probably because of the contamination of clean water, the disruption of water sanitation, and the inability to maintain home hygiene practices.",
1889,"SIMULATION OF FLOOD RISK AREA IN KELANTAN WATERSHED, MALAYSIA USING NUMERICAL MODEL Flood events have recently increased and caused extensive damages to the agricultural area and infrastructures, despite enormous efforts to decrease this hazard. Modeling of runoff can be a suitable approach to determine the effective factors in flooding, and to explore reasonable solution and thus to be able reduce hazard on watersheds. The current work attempted to derive basin and sub-basins, stream network, aspect, slop and all relevant physiographic parameters of Kelantan watershed in order to estimate depth of runoff using DEM data, satellite images and field study. In addition, the maximum rainfall intensity of all the meteorological stations were extracted and the interpolation of the values obtained, led to derive a contour map as rainfall intensity for the watershed. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) model was employed to calculate the surface flows, and to derive the flood hydrograph for all the sub-basins at the return periods of 5,10,25,50,100, considering to the Curve Number (CN) is a function of land use, soil, and primary moisture content. HEC-HMs model was calibrated for the study area using observed storm rainfall and recorded floods at the number of hydrometric stations. A good agreement was obtained between simulated and observed data with a correlation of 82%. Calibrated model was used to simulate depth of runoff in different return period that led to derive flood risk maps for Kelantan watershed. Results obtained revealed that flooding could be moderated and managed within a number of the sub - basins through implementing a technical scheme, depending on characteristic of the sub-basin, and its effect on the flood peak.",
1890,"Perceptions of Ayurvedic medicine by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh Bangladesh is now facing the public health problems of deficiency of iron and iodine, especially for women. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh has implemented strong countermeasures to enhance the health condition of the nation. On the other hand, based on the concept of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, complementary and alternative medicine should be used more vigorously to enhance public health in the world. The usage of complementary and alternative medicine such as ayurvedic medicine (AM) should be increased in Bangladesh. Therefore we conducted the study on perceptions of AM by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh in order to promote and enhance the effective usage of AM, including herbal medicines as medical resources, from December 2010 to January 2011. This study showed younger citizens (61.1%) did not get more benefit from AM than elder citizens (48.0%). On the other hand, younger citizens (76.8%) did not get more harm from AM than elder citizens (70.1%). We think that in terms of effectiveness of AM, the younger generation in Dhaka seems to be more skeptical to AM than the elder generation in Dhaka, even though the younger generation are more satisfied with AM than the elder generation. With viewpoint of enhancement of usage of AM in Dhaka, we think that scientifically sound information on AM should be collected rigorously and brought to the citizens vigorously to remove the skeptical feeling of AM from younger citizen in Dhaka. In terms of the effective utilization of limited medical resources, AM should be used appropriately in Bangladesh, Asia and the world.",
1891,"Piping process: Genesis and network characterization through a pedological and geophysical approach Piping is a soil erosion process initiated by concentrated subsurface water flow, which can develop in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes and causes various environmental impacts. The piping process acts as a relief modifier, leading to soil subsidence on a short time scale. This paper aims to provide a more comprehensive characterization of the piping process in a tropical forested area of Brazil. First, we sought to understand and examine the subsurface environment of the soil, using field description and soil sampling for chemical and physical analyses (pH, CEC, bulk density, total porosity, flocculation degree). Based on this information, we performed geophysical tests using Direct Current resistivity method (DC resistivity), with six lines of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), to map the pipes and check the connection between subsurface tunnels. Data on the basic properties of the soil aided our interpretation of the geophysical results and the genesis of the piping process. The soil of the study area presented horizons in which textural variations accompanied changes in total porosity, bulk density and flocculation degree. The DC resistivity method efficiently detected the pipes (resistive zones of values > 4000 O.m and high contrast with adjacent zones) and revealed the connection and continuity of the pipe network. While various factors may contribute to the subsurface erosive process in the study area, the decisive factor triggering the process seems to be the presence of a permeable layer that lies just above the impermeable layer, which may stop water infiltration and facilitate the lateral water movement.",
1892,"Influence of initial aperture variability on conduit development in hypogene settings The development of gypsum maze caves in hypogene settings is examined by process-based numerical modelling using a coupled continuum-pipe flow model. The model scenarios are largely based on field observations compiled from the gypsum karst terrain of the Western Ukraine. This area hosts the world's largest maze caves in gypsum and provides a well documented example of hypogene speleogenesis under artesian conditions. Building on previous studies that revealed the basic speleogenetic mechanisms in this type of setting, this work aims to examine the influence of the variability of the initial apertures on dissolutional growth of fissures and the evolving cave systems. To this end, the initial apertures were spatially uncorrelated and lognormally distributed and the influence of the coefficient of variation of the aperture data (sigma/mu) was investigated in several scenarios on the basis of a set of four realisations. It is found that a small degree of heterogeneity leads to cave patterns similar to those obtained with uniform initial apertures. However, with increasing heterogeneity the karstification process decelerates and a significant amount of variability between the different realisations follows. In an ensemble average sense, the aperture variability is determining the temporal development of the cave patterns and generally decelerates the karstification process, but appears to be of minor relevance regarding the general structure and geometric properties of the evolving cave patterns.",
1893,"Quality assessment of springs for drinking water in the Himalaya of South Kashmir, India The present study describes the water quality scenario of some freshwater springs of South Kashmir during the two-year period (2013-2015) because of rising pollution risks endangering water resources globally. The accessibility to quality drinking water has become a challenge and is receiving renewed attention. A total of 96 samples from twelve springs were collected and analyzed for major drinking water quality parameters. Piper trilinear and Durov diagram depicted dominance of Ca-Mg-HCO(3) hydrochemical facies and simple dissolution and mixing process. Water quality was falling in very good to excellent class and well within the desirable limits of WHO thereby indicating huge potential for meeting rising drinking water demand. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the generation of three components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) with higher eigenvalues of 3 or more (3-6) explaining 40, 21, and 17% of the overall variance in water quality data sets, respectively. The components obtained from PCA indicate that the parameters responsible for variations are mainly related to discharge, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (natural), nutrients (agriculture), and cation and anions (lithology). The results suggest that the hydrochemistry of springs is jointly controlled by lithology and anthropogenic inputs.",
1894,"Advanced oxidation removal of hypophosphite by O(3)/H(2)O(2) combined with sequential Fe(II) catalytic process Elimination of hypophosphite (HP) was studied as an example of nickel plating effluents treatment by O(3)/H(2)O(2) and sequential Fe(II) catalytic oxidation process. Performance assessment performed with artificial HP solution by varying initial pH and employing various oxidation processes clearly showed that the O(3)/H(2)O(2)â”€Fe(II) two-step oxidation process possessed the highest removal efficiency when operating under the same conditions. The effects of O(3) dosing, H(2)O(2) concentration, Fe(II) addition and Fe(II) feeding time on the removal efficiency of HP were further evaluated in terms of apparent kinetic rate constant. Under improved conditions (initial HP concentration of 50Â mgÂ L(-1), 75Â mgÂ L(-1) O(3), 1Â mLÂ L(-1) H(2)O(2), 150Â mgÂ L(-1) Fe(II) and pH 7.0), standard discharge (<0.5Â mgÂ L(-1) in China) could be achieved, and the Fe(II) feeding time was found to be the limiting factor for the evolution of apparent kinetic rate constant in the second stage. Characterization studies showed that neutralization process after oxidation treatment favored the improvement of phosphorus removal due to the formation of more metal hydroxides. Moreover, as a comparison with lab-scale Fenton approach, the O(3)/H(2)O(2)â”€Fe(II) oxidation process had more competitive advantages with respect to applicable pH range, removal efficiency, sludge production as well as economic costs.",
1895,"A survey of uranium levels in urine and hair of people living in a coal mining area in Yili, Xinjiang, China Recent reports have drawn attention to the uranium contamination arising from coal mining activities in the Yili region of Xinjiang, China due to the mixed distribution of uranium and coal mines, and some of the coal mines being associated with a high uranium content. In this study, we have collected water samples, solid samples such as soil, mud, coal, and coal ash, and hair and urine samples from local populations in order to evaluate the uranium level in this environment and its implications for humans in this high uranium coal mining area. Our results showed that uranium concentrations were 8.71-10.91â€¯Î¼gâ€¯L(-1) in underground water, whereas lower levels of uranium occurred in river water. Among the solid samples, coal ash contained fairly high concentrations of uranium (33.1â€¯Î¼gâ€¯g(-1)) due to enrichment from coal burning. In addition, uranium levels in the other solid samples were around 2.8â€¯Î¼gâ€¯g(-1) (the Earth's average background value). Uranium concentrations in hair and urine samples were 22.2-634.5â€¯ngâ€¯g(-1) (mean: 156.2â€¯ngâ€¯g(-1)) and 8.44-761.6â€¯ngâ€¯L(-1) (mean: 202.6â€¯ngâ€¯L(-1)), respectively, which are significantly higher than reference values reported for unexposed subjects in other areas. Therefore, these results indicate that people living in this coal mining area have been subjected to uranium exposure for long periods of time.",
1896,"Fluid-rock interactions during UHP metamorphism: A review of the Dabie-Sulu orogen, east-central China Comprehensive review on the characteristics of petrology, oxygen isotope, fluid inclusion and nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) for many Dabie-Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks including drill-hole core samples reveals that fluid has played important and multiple roles during complicated fluid-rock interactions attending the subduction and exhumation of supracrustal rocks. We have identified several distinct stages of fluid-rock interactions as follows: (1) The Neoproterozoic supercrustal protoliths of UHP rocks experienced variable degrees of hydration through interactions with cold meteoric water with extremely low oxygen isotope compositions during Neoproterozoic Snow-ball Earth time. (2) A series of dehydration reactions took place during Triassic subduction of the Yangtze plate beneath the Sino-Korean plate; the released fluid entered mainly into volatile-bearing high-pressure (HP) and UHP minerals, such as phengite, zoisite-epidote, talc, lawsonite and magnesite, as well as into UHF NAMs, such as garnet, omphacite and rutile. (3) Silicate-rich supercritical fluid (hydrous melt) existed during the UHP metamorphism at mantle depths >100 km which mobilized many normally fluid-immobile elements and caused unusual element fractionation. (4) The fluid exsolved from the NAMs during the early exhumation of the Dabie-Sulu terrane was the main source for HP hydrate retrogression and generation of HP veins. (5) Local amphibolite-facies retrogression at crustal depths took place by infiltration of aqueous fluid of various salinities possibly derived from an external source. (6) The greenschist-facies overprinting and low-pressure (LP) quartz veins were generated by fluid flow along ductile shear zones and brittle faults during late-stage uplift of the UHP terrane.

1897,"Balanced Nutrient Management for Crop Intensification and Livelihood Improvement: A Case Study from Watershed in Andhra Pradesh, India Soil health assessment of farmers' fields in watershed villages in Medak district, Andhra Pradesh, India showed widespread deficiencies of sulfur (S), boron (B), and zinc (Zn) in addition to organic carbon and phosphorus (P). Participatory on-farm trials on soil test-based application of deficient Zn, B, and S along with nitrogen (N) and P during 2009 to 2012 significantly increased crop yields over farmers' practice (FP)-by 31% to 45% in chickpea, 15% to 16% in cotton, 12% to 15% in paddy, and 8% to 9% in sugarcane. Total soluble sugars in sugarcane under balanced nutrition (BN) increased by 13%. Residual benefits of S, B, and Zn were observed in succeeding chilly crop (12% higher yield). Benefit to cost (B:C) ratios of BN ranged between 2.8 to 8.5 in chickpea, 2.6 to 4.4 in cotton, 2.3 to 2.9 in paddy, and 7.1 to 11.4 in sugarcane, indicating economic feasibility for scaling-up.",
1898,"Trace heavy metals associated with crude oil: a case study of Ebocha-8 oil-spill-polluted site in Niger Delta, Nigeria The Ebocha-8 oil-spill-polluted site was identified as study site according to field reconnaissance surveys of oil-polluted sites in Obiobi/Obrikom prospect area of Niger Delta. A sampling area was delimited at each of the oil-spill-affected sites by the grid technique, and soils were collected at surface (0-15 cm) and subsurface (15-30 cm) depths from three replicate quadrants. A geographically similar, unaffected area, located in 50-m distance from each contaminated site, was chosen as control site. Trace heavy metals, Ni, V, Cu, Cd, and Pb, which are normal constituents of crude oil, were determined in the soils by atomic-absorption spectrophotometry after pre-extraction of cations with dithionite-citrate carbonate. Ni varied from 0.53 to 18.00 mg/kg, Cu from 0.15 to 0.30 mg/kg, and Pb from 0.32 to 0.80 mg/kg in surface and subsurface soils, respectively; Cd and V were less than 0.20 mg/kg in all sampled plots. Ni, Cu, and Pb were more enhanced (P<0.05) in the oil-spill-polluted soils, especially at surface depth, and this may be attributed to the fact that metal profiles in polluted soils penetrate a little below the 10-cm region, even after many years, thereby making the metal concentration in surface soils usually higher. Whilst the Ebocha-8 oil spillage may be responsible, at least in part, for the enhanced concentrations and paucity of variations in the metal concentrations of sampled plots, other factors such as the physicochemical characteristics of soils (e.g., soil pH and organic-matter content) and relative mobility of these metals, as well as the intense rainfall and flooding that preceded the period of sampling, may also have contributed in part. Enhanced levels of these micronutrients in the soils may result in enhanced absorption by plants, which may bring about possible bioaccumulation by such plants and the animals that depend on them for survival, and all of these may lead to toxic reactions along the food chain.",
1899,"NiCo-layered double hydroxide/g-C3N4 heterostructures with enhanced adsorption capacity and photoreduction of Cr(VI) Photo-catalytic reduction of highly toxic Cr(VI) using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based photocatalysts under visible light irradiation condition has been attracting considerable attention recent years. Here, we report the development of heterostructured NiCo-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) grown horizontally on g-C3N4 nanosheets with different degrees of crystallinity (amorphous to crystalline), NiCoLDH/g-C3N4, with high photocatalytic activity for the reduction of toxic hexavalent chromium ions (Cr(VI)) as well as high adsorption capability for congo red (CR) photodegradation under visible light irradiation. The presence of NiCoLDH nanoparticles promotes the adsorption of the anionic pollutants while g-C3N4 in the heterostructure promotes fast photodegradation of CR and reduction of Cr(VI). The NiCoLDH/g-C3N4 composite prepared using amorphous-crystalline g-C3N4 homojunctions shows the best adsorption performance. The kinetic data demonstrates improved correlation coefficient for the pseudo-second-order (R-2 > 0.99) and Freundlich isotherm model. The NiCoLDH/g-C3N4 composite shows an improved separation efficiency of photogenerated electron and hole pairs, leading to its improved Cr(VI) adsorption and photo-reduction performance. The monolayer adsorption capacities of CR and Cr(VI) of the NiCoLDH/g-C3N4 heterostructured composite can be as high as 1100 and 46 mg/g at 30 degrees C, respectively. This work provides new perspectives for the development of highly efficient g-C3N4-based composite photocatalysts for wastewater treatment related applications.",
1900,"Assessment of Uranium in Correlation with Physico-chemical Properties of Drinking Water of Northern Rajasthan In the present study, analysis of U-238 concentration in 40 drinking water samples collected from different locations of Jodhpur, Nagaur, Bikaner and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan, India has been carried out by using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (HR-ICP-MS) technique. The water samples were taken from hand pumps and tube wells having depths ranging from 50 to 800 feet. The measured uranium concentration lies in the range from 0.89 to 166.89 mu g l(-1) with the mean value of 31.72 mu g l(-1). The measured uranium content in twelve water samples was found to be higher than the safe limit of 30 mu g l(-1) as recommended by World Health Organization (WHO, 2011) and US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA, 2011). Radiological risk calculated in the form of annual effective dose estimated from annual uranium intake ranges from 0.66 to 138.63 mu Sv y(-1) with the mean value of 26.28 mu Sv y(-1). The annual effective dose in two drinking water samples was found to be greater than WHO (2004) recommended level of 100 mu Sv y(-1). Chemical risk calculated in the form of lifetime average daily dose (LAAD) estimated from the water samples varies from 0.02 to 4.57 mu g kg(-1) d(-1) with the mean value of 0.87 mu g kg(-1) d(-1). The lifetime average daily dose (LAAD) of ten drinking water samples was found to be greater than WHO (2011) recommended level of 1 mu g kg(-1) d(-1). The corresponding values of hazard quotient of 48% water samples were found to be greater than unity.A good positive correlation of uranium concentration with total dissolved solids (TDS) and conductance has been observed. However no correlation of uranium concentration with pH was observed. The results revels that uranium concentration in drinking water samples of the study area can cause radiological and chemical threat to the inhabitants.",
1901,"Status quo and present challenges of the sustainable use and management of water and land resources in Central Asian irrigation zones - The example of the Navoi region (Uzbekistan) Soil salinization is a major problem in many arid and agriculturally used regions and Central Asia is a prime example for this. Intensive irrigation, saline water resources, shallow groundwater tables and high evapotranspiration rates lead to the enrichment of salts in the top soils and a reduced soil productivity in the Central Asian lowlands. This is aggravated by a strong socioeconomic growth which results in an increase in the water consumption and the intensification of the farming practices (e.g. fertilizer application). This article analyses these problems for the Navoi province in Uzbekistan, a region located in the lower reaches of the Zarafshan River in the Kyzyl Kum desert. Between 2000 and 2015 detailed data on the groundwater table, groundwater salinity and the soil salinity were collected, complemented by meteorological data, soil characteristics, water use, and fertilizer statistics. Based on these datasets the ameliorate soil conditions in the Navoi irrigation zone and their temporal dynamic were assessed. The results show that both the groundwater and soil salinity have improved slightly during the last 15 years. Especially the percentages of samples with a high salinity have been reduced significantly. In 2015 only 0.7% of the irrigated soils have been categorized as highly saline while 71.3% were only slightly saline and 18.3% non-saline, while those values for the year 2000 were 6.1%, 51.5%, and 13.2%. The ameliorate soil conditions, on the other hand, have not improved accordingly, but showed a slight deterioration, even if they are overall satisfactory in 79.6% of the area. The percentage of irrigated soils with an unsatisfactory condition has increased from 3 to 13.9% between 2000 and 2014. This development is not related to any climatological, soil or groundwater parameters, so that the impacts of an increased water usage for urban and industrial purposes (and the related effects on the water quality), as well as the increased fertilizer application, seem to be a possible explanation for the observed trend. The results show the impact of the low efficiency of the irrigation and drainage system, which is outdated, not well maintained and thus often failing, on the groundwater level and the soil salinization, but also how the attempts to update the system during the recent years has led to a slight improvement of the soil and groundwater salinity.

1902,"Evaluation of Irrigation Water Quality in Golbasi District Golbasi district, located at 20 km south of Ankara city is one of the special environmental protection areas (SEPA) of Turkey. The water resources of Golbasi district are under the pressure of urbanization and agricultural activities. In recent years, the demand for groundwater has increased, however accesibility is limited by the quantity and quality of water. This study aims to evaluate the irrigation water quality in Golbasi SEPA. A total of 41 water samples were collected from existing wells and fountains in 11 villages of Golbasi SEPA and analyzed for relevant quality parameters to assess their conformity with irrigation water quality standards. Analysis of samples led to classification of samples into 19 groups with common characteristics. Among them, 20 samples in Group 1-5 had salinity and alkalinity class of C2-S1, and they had the best water quality. On the other hand, 15 samples in Groups 6-14 had salinity and alkalinity class of C3-S1. Since these waters have high level of salt, leaching and special soil tillage is required to avoid salinity problem on the long-term. Yield reduction up to 10-25% may be experienced with alfalfa and corn. Among the samples, only 6 waters had salinity class of C4, and alkalinity of S1, S2 or S4. These waters are not suitable for irrigation under normal conditions. In special cases, they can be used if salt resistant plants are selected, where drainage is good and excess leaching is applied. Land reclamation may be required on the long term. Yield reduction up to 25-50% may be experienced with alfalfa and corn due to salinity.",
1903,"Methods for Post-Disaster Impact Assessment: A Case Study of the Impacts of the Fundao Dam Failure on Terrestrial Species Threatened with Extinction The Fundao tailings dam held back approximately 50 million cubic meters of tailings from an Fe ore mine in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The dam failed on 5 November 2015, releasing tailings into the Rio Doce watershed and causing an environmental disaster in a biodiversity hotspot. To guide conservation action following the event, Brazilian authorities demanded an impact assessment focused on terrestrial species threatened by extinction. Postdisaster impact assessment is substantially more challenging than predevelopment impact assessment. Predisaster baseline data were sparse, and much was unknown about how the Fundao dam failure impacted terrestrial species threatened with extinction. Baseline reconstruction and impact pathway validation and characterization was critical. Ecosystem reconstruction revealed that 1580 ha of terrestrial ecosystems were destroyed, including approximately 480 ha of Atlantic rainforest. Collaboration with local experts identified 346 species of vertebrates, invertebrates, and vascular plants threatened with extinction that were impacted or potentially impacted. Species composition and impacts varied within 4 distinct segments of the Rio Doce watershed. Nine potential impact pathways were identified using data and literature review combined with information provided by regulators, experts, and media. Not all were valid. Validating and characterizing each pathway within each watershed segment involved data evaluation, an ecological risk screening, and field assessments. Impact pathway evaluation proved critical to dispelling misconception, accurately understanding postdisaster impacts, and directing conservation action; the importance of this step cannot be overemphasized.

1904,"Forecasting coverage and non-revenue water with Markov process This study utilises empirical data on service coverage (reflecting network expansion and new connections growth) and billing efficiency of National Water and Sewerage Corporation in Uganda (2003-2010). Markov processes were used to enhance the understanding and visualisation of explanatory factors underlying past trends as a basis for forecasting the future. Specifically, it was found that coverage (involving service up-take) and billing policies (affecting non-revenue water) may be adequate for operational purposes. However, policies can lead to a 'less-than expected' rate of exponential growth in the long-run, if attention is not given to associated uncertainties and explanatory factors. Sets of probability transition matrices, which present useful 'intelligent' forecasting properties that can be triggers for evaluating and designing infrastructure policy were derived. The study also highlights growth trends that are reminiscent of 'absorbing' states; such patterns characterise the achievement of policy objectives.",
1905,"Facile Synthesis of a Pentiptycene-Based Highly Microporous Organic Polymer for Gas Storage and Water Treatment Rigid H-shaped pentiptycene units, with an intrinsic hierarchical structure, were employed to fabricate a highly microporous organic polymer sorbent via Friedel-Crafts reaction/polymerization. The obtained microporous polymer exhibits good thermal stability, a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 1604 m(2) g(-1), outstanding CO(2), H(2), and CH(4) storage capacities, as well as good adsorption selectivities for the separation of CO(2)/N(2) and CO(2)/CH(4) gas pairs. The CO(2) uptake values reached as high as 5.00 mmol g(-1) (1.0 bar and 273 K), which, along with high adsorption selectivity values (e.g., 47.1 for CO(2)/N(2)), make the pentiptycene-based microporous organic polymer (PMOP) a promising sorbent material for carbon capture from flue gas and natural gas purification. Moreover, the PMOP material displayed superior absorption capacities for organic solvents and dyes. For example, the maximum adsorption capacities for methylene blue and Congo red were 394 and 932 mg g(-1), respectively, promoting the potential of the PMOP as an excellent sorbent for environmental remediation and water treatment.",
1906,"Bacterial sulfate reduction limits natural arsenic contamination in groundwater Natural arsenic contamination of groundwater, increasingly recognized as a threat to human health worldwide, is characterized by arsenic concentrations that vary sharply over short distances. Variation in arsenic levels in the Mahomet aquifer system, a regional glacial aquifer in central Illinois, appears to arise from variable rates of bacterial sulfate reduction in the subsurface, not differences in arsenic supply. Where sulfate-reducing bacteria are active, the sulfide produced reacts to precipitate arsenic, or coprecipitate it with iron, leaving little in solution. In the absence of sulfate reduction, methanogenesis is the dominant type of microbial metabolism, and arsenic accumulates to high levels.",

1908,"3D magnetic interpretation of the Regis kimberlite pipe, Minas Gerais, Brazil In the present work, high-resolution ground magnetic data are used to unveil the structure of the Regis kimberlite pipe, which is located in a well-known diamondiferous province in the central portion of Brazil. The main tectonic feature of the area is a NW-SE major crustal fracture zone, extending for more than 3000 km within Brazil, along which Regis and several other kimberlite pipes have intruded. The area is located at low magnetic latitude (inclination approximately 27 south) and the ground magnetic anomaly associated with the Regis pipe appears as an isolated asymmetric dipole-like source caused by magnetization primarily in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. We inverted this high-resolution magnetic data set in order to recover the 3D effective susceptibility model of the studied pipe. We obtained an asymmetric conical-shaped strongly magnetized body (35 x 10(-3) SI units) extending from 50-720 m depth. Prior to the inversion, the data were upward continued to 30 in above the surface to attenuate high-frequency noise and mitigate inversion artefacts. Our results were used to better define the subsequent drilling positions to thoroughly evaluate the economic potential of the Regis pipe. One available borehole drilled approximately in the centre of the structure corroborates our interpretation.",
1909,"The contribution of infrastructure investment to Britain's urban mortality decline, 1861-1900 It is well-recognized that both improved nutrition and sanitation infrastructure are important contributors to mortality decline. However, the relative importance of the two factors is difficult to quantify since most studies are limited to testing the effects of specific sanitary improvements. This article uses new historical data regarding total investment in urban infrastructure, measured using the outstanding loan stock, to estimate the extent to which the mortality decline in England and Wales between 1861 and 1900 can be attributed to government expenditure. Fixed effects regressions indicate that infrastructure investment explains approximately 30 per cent of the decline in mortality between 1861 and 1900. Since these specifications may not fully account for the endogeneity between investment and mortality, additional specifications are estimated using lagged investment as an instrument for current investment. These estimates suggest that government investment was the major contributor to mortality decline, explaining up to 60 per cent of the reduction in total urban mortality between 1861 and 1900. Additional results indicate that investment in urban infrastructure led to declines in mortality from both waterborne and airborne diseases.",
1910,"Snow cover mapping using SPOT VEGETATION with high resolution data: Application in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains This study is part of the SUDMED project from IRD (Research Institute for Development), CESBIO, University of Marrakech and Moroccan administrations in charge of agriculture, forestry and water management. The objective of this project is the hydro-ecological modeling of hydrological resources on the Marrakech region. In this context, it is important to characterize the snow cover and the melting dynamics as it is the main water source for the plain. Evaluate the snow cover using satellite images at a short temporal scale is a first step to estimate water quantity available during the melting season, in spring. The objective of this study is to calculate the snow cover area and to follow its evolution during the winter season using both high and low satellite imagery. For this purpose, several snow cover indices (SCI) calculated from low resolution images SPOT/VEGETATION (pixel size of 1 km2) have been compared with the snow cover percentage (SCP) calculated derived from high spatial resolution sensors (in particular Landsat-TM). Particular attention was given to the classification procedure and the co-registration problem. Then, pixel-based regressions between SCP and SCI have been calibrated for several dates (when both VEGETATION and TM images were available) with the objective of finding the most robust relationship. The previous relation is applied to a time series of 30 SPOT/VEGETATION images acquired from December 1998 to May 1999. The dynamics of snow cover is compared with rainfalls and flow chronicles observed on three mountainous watersheds. The main interest of this study is to show that low resolution precision can be easily improved using high resolution imagery to obtain reliable quantitative information on snow cover.

1911,"Spontaneous Imbibition of Three Leading Shale Formations in the Middle Yangtze Platform, South China Widely distributed in the Middle Yangtze Platform, Lorigniaxi, Dalong and Dongyuemiao shales are the most potential target zones for shale gas development in south China. In this study, samples from these main shale gas-producing intervals, with a range of total organic carbon (TOC), mineral compositions, and thermal :maturities (from mature to overmature), were selected from three shale gas wells in the Middle Yangtze Platform to investigate their pore structures and spontaneous imbibition characteristics. Mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) results show the pore throats in these organic shales are mainly within nanometer range, and the pores with pore-throat diameter of 3-50 nm account for 56.7%-73.1% of the total pore volume in mature Dongyuemiao Shale, which is comparative to S1.4%-82.7% for Dalong Shale but smaller than the 68.1%-86.5% range for overmature Longmaxi Shale, which is probably associated with abundance of organic matter-hosted pores in Longmaxi Shale. According to the different imbibition behaviors toward deionized (DI) water (a hydrophilic fluid) and n-decane (a hydrophobic fluid), the pore connectivity and wettability characteristics were qualitatively assessed. Most of the shales exhibit a better pore connectivity toward n-decane, while a few samples with high brittle minerals and clay minerals contents have a high imbibition rate for DI water. Imbibition tests also suggest that Longmaxi Shale is mixed-wet, while Dalong and Dongyuemiao Shales are oil-wet or weakly water-wet, which is generally consistent with the contact angle measurement. Sorptivity obtained from the imbibition tests of wetting n-decane shows positive relationships with porosity and clay contents, but a negative correlation toward the TOC content. In addition, a lower-bound of the estimated permeability from wetting n-decane imbibition tests ranges from 135 nD to 528 nD, and matches well with reported measured matrix permeability.",
1912,"Phyto-genotoxicity of arsenic contaminated soil from Lakhimpur Kheri, India on Vicia faba L The present experiment was designed to evaluate physico-chemical characteristics and phyto-genotoxicity of arsenic (As) contaminated soil collected from different sites of Lakhimpur, Uttar Pradesh (UP), India by employing Vicia faba L. The analyses included various biochemical as well as cyto-genotoxicity assays. The results showed that soil pH was slightly acidic to neutral in nature. The bulk density (1.18-1.23 gcm(-3)), particle density (2.51-2.59 gcm(-3)) and porosity (44-53%) varied in different places. The level of available nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was found to vary as 124-165â€¯mgkg-1, 173-186â€¯mgkg-1 and 48-98â€¯mgkg-1, respectively. The maximum As levels were found in soil of Fulvareya (27.13â€¯mgkg-1) and Atareya (24.12â€¯mgkg-1), the level of As in water samples of these sites were 0.19â€¯mgl(-1)and 0.21â€¯mgl(-1), respectively. Phytotoxicity of the As present in soils was evident through significant increases in stress metabolites, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl groups in root and shoot of V.Â faba. Cyto-genotoxic effects were also seen through reduced mitotic index (MI) and increased mitotic depression (MD), relative abnormality rate (RAR) as well as other chromosomal abnormalities along with micronuclei in root meristematic cells of V.Â faba. The phytotoxicity and cyto-genotoxicity assessment suggests the harmful soil properties that might affect biota.",
1913,"Recent atmospheric dust deposition in an ombrotrophic peat bog in Great Hinggan Mountain, Northeast China Recent deposition of atmospheric soil dust (ASD) was studied using (210)pb-dated Sphagnum-derived peat sequences from Great Hinggan Mountain in northeast China. Physicochemical indices of peat including dry bulk density, water content, ash content, total organic carbon and mass magnetic susceptibility were measured. Acid-insoluble concentration of lithogenic metals (Al, Ca, Fe, Mn, V and Ti) were measured using ICP-AES. The basic physicochemical properties were used to assess the peat trophic status and indicated that the sections above 45-60 cm are rain-fed peat. A continuous record of ASD fluxes over the past 150 years was reconstructed based on the geochemical data obtained from the ombrotrophic zone, and the average input rate of ASD is 13.4-68.1 g m(-2) year(-1). The source of soil dust deposited in peat was dominated by the long-range transport of mineral aerosol from the drylands in north China and Mongolia. The temporal variation of ASD fluxes in the last 60 years coincides well with the meteorological records of dust storm frequency during 1954-2002 in north China. This suggests that the reconstructed sequence of atmospheric dust deposition is reliable and we can look back in time at the dust evolution before 1949. Dust storm events were observed occasionally in the late Qing dynasty, and their frequency and intensity were smaller than dust weather occurring in recent times. Four peaks of ASD fluxes were distinguished and correlated with the historical events at that time. This study presents the first atmospheric soil dust data in peat records in northeast China, and complements a global database of peat bog archives of atmospheric deposition. The results reflect the patterns of local environmental change over the past century in north China and will be helpful in formulating policies to achieve sustainable and healthy development.

1914,"[Output characteristics of non-point phosphorus from a typical small watershed in Yimeng mountainous area under the special rainfall] The relationships between pollutant concentrations and precipitation-runoff combined with the first and maximum intensity natural rainfall events were monitored at the outlets of the Menglianggu watershed in 2010. The results showed that dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), total dissolved phosphorus (DP), total particle phosphorus (PP) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the first rainfall were higher than those in the maximum intensity rainfall which was the largest average rainfall intensity, but the output of phosphorusin the first rainfall was all higher than that in the maximum intensity rainfall except dissolved organic phosphorus. The DOP, DIP, DP, PP and TP in two special rainfall events contributed 48%, 81%, 70%, 87% and 81% of the total output of rainy season. DP and TP were mainly composed by DIP and PP respectively. The two special rainfalls have the first flush effect and the maximum intensity rainfall was stronger than the first rainfall, so the analysis of M (V) curve showed that the priority should be given to the interception of corresponding phosphorus under special events. The regression analysis results showed that a linear relation existed between runoff and nutrient output, but there were some differences which the slope of the linear equation of the first rainfall was higher than that of the maximum intensity rainfall. Reducing agricultural practices such as tillage and fertilization during special rainfall period and building canals, ponds are effective ways for mitigating agricultural non-point source pollution.",
1915,"EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF STRUCTURAL-MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF HEAVY OIL Structural-mechanical properties of heavy oil from Kazakhstan deposits under the heat treatment were studied in this work. The most important and the least studied issues in the technology for the preparation and collection of oil products is the evaluation of the structural and mechanical properties of heavy oils and emulsions and ways to regulate formation them. A feature of the wells operation of fields with high viscosity oils is a sharp increase in water cut at the initial stage of development, which is associated with an excessively large difference in the rheological characteristics of reservoir oil and water. The formation of stable emulsions does not allow for the effective separation of oil from water and leads to a deterioration in product quality. In this regard, in modern conditions of intensification of hydrocarbon production, consideration of the options for the formation and destruction of complex emulsions is a prerequisite for the effective operation of oilfield treatment facilities. Therefore, the research relevance is of reducing the irretrievable losses of hydrocarbons in production systems and study the physical-chemical, structural-mechanical properties of heavy oils emulsions and to develop methods for their regulation, as well as improving oil treatment devices.",
1916,"Water-Cooled Resistive Magnets at CHMFL The steady high magnetic field facility was founded by the National Development and Reform Commission of China (NDRC) in 2008 and is undertaken by the High Magnetic Field Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

1917,"An evidence based efficacy and safety assessment of the ethnobiologicals against poisonous and non-poisonous bites used by the tribals of three westernmost districts of West Bengal, India: Anti-phospholipase A2 and genotoxic effects INTRODUCTION: To explore the ethnobiological wisdom of the tribals of three western districts of West Bengal, India against poisonous and non-poisonous bites and stings, a quantitative approach was adopted. These age-old yet unexplored knowledge can be utilized in finding lead-molecules against poisonous and non-poisonous animal-bites. Further, an evidence-based approach is needed to assess the venom-neutralization ability of plants by experimental studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 2008-2009 and 2012-2017, 11 ethnomedicinal surveys were carried out to explore the use of medicinal flora and fauna via conducting open semi-structured interviews with 47 traditional healers (THs) or informants. The retrieved dataset was statistically evaluated using seven quantitative-indexes: use-value (UV), informants'-consensus-factor (ICF), fidelity-level (FL), relative-importance (RI), cultural importance-index (CI), index of agreement on remedies (IAR) and cultural agreement-index (CAI). Anti-phospholipaseA2 (PLA2) properties of selected plant extracts were also examined. In addition, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the water extract of the plants showing high FL as well as significant PLA2 inhibitory potential were investigated using Allium cepa root tip assay. RESULTS: A total of 41 traditional-formulations (TFs) containing 40 plant species (of 39 genera from 28 families) and 3 animal species were prescribed by the THs. Fabaceae exhibited most number of medicinal plants. Piper nigrum (1.78) and Apis cerana indica and Crossopriza lyoni (both 0.21) exhibited the highest UV among the plants and the animals respectively. Stinging of centipede and dog/cat/hyena bite displayed highest ICF (1.00 each). Among the plants, the maximum RI (0.91) and CI (4.98) values were observed for Aristolochia indica. IAR (1.00) was recorded maximum for Achyranthes aspera, Gloriosa superba, Lycopodium cernuum, Smilax zeylanica and Streblus asper. Maximum CAI value was noted for Piper nigrum (5.5096). Among the animals, Apis cerana indica (0.31) and Crossopriza lyoni (1.52) displayed the highest RI and CI values respectively. Crossopriza lyoni (0.99) and Apis cerana indica (1.3871) exhibited maximum IAR and CAI values respectively. Plants showing higher FL exhibited higher anti-PLA2 activity via selective inhibition of human-group PLA2. In addition, Allium cepa root tip assay has indicated the safety and/or toxicity of the plant parts prescribed by the THs. Root water extracts of Aristolochia indica and Gloriosa superba exhibited significant genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Three western districts of West Bengal is the natural abode for many tribal and non-tribal communities. A noteworthy correlation was established between the plants used against poisonous-bites and their anti-PLA2 activity. A few plant parts used by the THs also exhibited high toxicity. Such alternative medical practices serve as the only option in these underprivileged and backward areas during medical-exigencies.",
1918,"[Zonation on non-point source pollution risk in the lower reaches of Zijiang River based on the ""source-sink"" theory] Non-point source pollution risk assessment and zonation research are of great significance for the eco-environmental protection and optimization of land use structure. We identified the ""source"" and ""sink"" landscape using the ""source-sink"" landscape pattern theory based on the two phases of land use data in the lower reaches of Zijiang River in 2010 and 2018. We comprehensively considered the non-point source pollution occurrence and migration factors, and used location-weighted landscape contrast index (LCI) and non-point source pollution load index (NPPRI) to analyze non-point source pollution risk spatio-temporal characteristics in the study area. Zonation on non-point source pollution in the lower reaches of Zijiang River was studied by identifying the key factors of non-point source pollution risk. The results showed that the overall risk of non-point source pollution was relatively low. The sub-basin with ""sink"" landscape was the main type, accounting for 61.2%. Non-point source pollution risk was low in the southwest and was high along the banks of Zhixi River, Taohua River and main stream of Zijiang River, as well as plain in the northeast of the lower Zijiang River. The risk of non-point source pollution from 2010 to 2018 showed an increasing trend. The changes in landscape pattern, especially the expansion of rural settlement, arable land and the shrinkage of forest land had positive and negative responses to the risk of non-point source pollution, respectively. LCI, slope, and distance were the key factors affecting the change of the risk index of non-point source pollution. The lower reaches of the Zijiang River could be divided into four control regions: pollution treatment area near river, low slope pollution control area, ecological restoration-risk prevention and control area, and ecological priority protection area.",
1919,"Effective Remediation of Groundwater Fluoride with Inexpensively Processed Indian Bauxite India represents one-third of the world's fluorosis burden and is the fifth global producer of bauxite ore, which has previously been identified as a potential resource for remediating fluoride-contaminated groundwater in impoverished communities. Here, we use thermal activation and/or groundwater acidification to enhance fluoride adsorption by Indian bauxite obtained from Visakhapatnam, an area proximate to endemic fluorosis regions. We compare combinatorial water treatment and bauxite-processing scenarios through batch adsorption experiments, material characterization, and detailed cost analyses. Heating Indian bauxite above 300 degrees C increases available surface area by > 15X (to similar to 170 m(2)/g) through gibbsite dehydroxylation and reduces the bauxite dose for remediating 10 ppm F- to 1.5 ppm F- by similar to 93% (to 21 g/L). Additionally, lowering groundwater pH to 6.0 with HCl or CO2 further reduces the average required bauxite doses by 43-73% for ores heated at 300 degrees C (similar to 12 g/L) and 100 degrees C (similar to 77 g/L). Product water in most examined treatment scenarios complies with EPA standards for drinking water (e.g., As, Cd, Pb, etc.) but potential leaching of Al, Mn, and Cr is of concern in some scenarios. Among the defluoridation options explored here, bauxite heated at 300 degrees C in acidified groundwater has the lowest direct costs ($6.86 per person per year) and material-intensity.",
1920,"Data on Nitrate-Nitrite pollution in the groundwater resources a Sonqor plain in Iran Nitrate is a groundwater pollutant which in higher concentrations limits, leads to health hazard such as Methemoglobinemia and formation of nitrosamine compounds. In this research, the nitrate and nitrite concentrations in all water resources in the villages of Songor plain were determined and the relationship between these values with the water table and zonation of nitrate concentration were investigated in the GIS environment. In this study, 37 samples of all groundwater resources of Sonqor plain were taken in, high water (March 2016) and low water (October 2017) periods. Water nitrate levels were then determined by spectrophotometry and results compared with national standards of Iran and analyzed by SPSS. Finally, the concentration distribution mapping was carried out in GIS environment and the factors affecting nitrite changes were analyzed. Nitrate concentration of water resources of Sonqor plain was fluctuating at 3.09-88.5 mg per Liter. In one station, nitrite concentrations in the high (88.5 mg/L) and low (71.4 mg/L) water seasons were higher than the maximum limit. Low thickness of alluvium, the site of wells in the downstream farmlands, the farming situation of the region, nitrate leaching from agricultural soils and wide use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture were considered as the causes of the pollution in one station. Though the average concentration of nitrate and nitrite are not high in this region, but because of problematic consequences of high nitrate concentrations to human health, proper management in use of chemical fertilizers, treatment or disposal of contaminated wells and protection of water wells is highly recommended.

1921,"Evaluating the Effect ofProsopis juliflora, an Alien Invasive Species, on Land Cover Change Using Remote Sensing Approach Invasive plant species (IPS) affect people's livelihoods and well-being by providing both benefits and costs in different contexts. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact ofProsopis juliflorainvasion on land cover change using ground survey and satellite sensor data derived from Landsat ETM+. The study was conducted at Sweimeh, Jordan Valley, between 1999 and 2017. The overall classification accuracy of remotely sensed data was 86% for 1999 and 80% for 2017. Accordingly, a remote sensing approach has the potential to assess land change/cover and aid in monitoring the IPS, specificallyProsopisinvasion. Change detection analysis of Landsat classes (i.e., 1999 and 2017) showed that bare soil, urban, and water surface areas decreased by 6%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. Conversely, the vegetation class (i.e., IPS and native plants) increased by 20%. Ground surveys in 1999 and 2017 showed that the average vegetation area in Sweimeh invaded byProsopiswas approximately 60% in 1999 and 70% in 2017. Accordingly, the total estimated area invaded byP. julifloraat Sweimeh (2106 ha) in 1999 was approximately 92 ha, whileProsopiscoverage in the same region was approximately 413 ha in 2017. The high emergence rate, the adaptation to high temperatures and low precipitation as well as governmental regulations which restrict the removal of trees, including IPS, were the main factors that prompted the extremeP. juliflorainvasion in the Jordan Valley. The high invasion rate has led to a reduction in native species, includingTamarixspp., and dried up five natural water springs in the area. Overall, a monitoring plan should be applied to control the invasion problem byProsopisin the valley. In addition, the conservation regulations that deal with IPS should be revised to mitigate the IPS risk.",
1922,"Radioactivity concentrations and risk assessment of Tekirdag lignites (case study of Malkara coalfield) Malkara coals are located in the Oligocene-aged Danismen Formation in the Thrace Tertiary coal basin. The Danismen Formation consists of limestone, sandstone, tuffite, siltstone, claystone and intercalated coal. Elemental and specific natural radionuclide concentrations of lignites collected from Tekirdag-Malkara coalfield were determined, and the associated radiological risk was assessed. In order to examine the depth-dependent radionuclide concentration changes, samples were taken from top, middle and bottom parts of the boreholes. Gamma spectrometric measurements of radionuclide activities were performed with HPGe detector. The calculated mean(226)Ra,Th-232 and(40)K concentrations were 27.0 +/- 3.57, 18.9 +/- 3.28 and 155 +/- 36.1 Bq kg(-1), and the measured U, Th, Pb and K concentrations were 4.04, 6.27, 10.6 ppm and 0.82%, respectively. Findings were comparable with the reported literature for Turkey and other countries from the world. The dose due to the radionuclide content of lignites was not very high to pose a serious health risk.",
1923,"Preliminary design of hybrid energy reactor and integral neutron experiments We propose a preliminary design for a fusion-fission hybrid energy reactor (FFHER), based on current fusion science and technology (with some extrapolations forward from ITER) and well-developed fission technology. We list design rules and put forward a primary concept blanket, with uranium alloy as fuel and water as coolant. The uranium fuel can be natural uranium, LWR spent fuel, or depleted uranium. The FFHER design can increase the utilization rate of uranium in a comparatively simple way to sustain the development of nuclear energy. We study the interaction between the fusion neutron and the uranium fuel with the aim of to achieving greater energy multiplication and tritium sustainability. We also review other concept hybrid reactor designs. We design integral neutron experiments in order to verify the credibility of our proposed physical design. The combination of this program of research with the related thermal hydraulic design, alloy fuel manufacture, and nuclear fuel cycle programs provides the science and technology foundation for the future development of the FFHER concept in China.

1924,"Substance flow analysis of aluminum industry in mainland China This study reports a substance flow analysis (SFA) of the aluminum (Al) industry in China. The flows, stocks, trades, and losses of life cycle stages and sub-stages were quantified according to figures from 2013, and led to a detailed budget of Al resources. Moreover, SFA indices were developed to describe the external dependency (ED) of Al, the importance of secondary Al, and the material input for Al. The major results of the study are as follows: (1) From a life cycle perspective, the main environmental burden is attributable to the primary Al production (PAP) stage. (2) A high ED revealed that China is facing a severe shortage of Al resource. (3) Material input indicators revealed that the Al industry requires large volumes of ore resources, energy, and water. (4) The high dependency on ore resources, low Al resource efficiency, and low recycled content are all related to the share of secondary Al production. (5) The key to reducing the high ED and the material inputs, and improving resource efficiency is to improve the share of secondary Al. The detailed SFA conducted in this study provides a basis for identifying resource efficiency, loss rate, direct material input, and the ecological rucksack of Al in China, as well as guidance for future decisions concerning ways to improve the resource efficiency of the Al industry.

1925,"Improving Streamflow Forecast Lead Time Using Oceanic-Atmospheric Oscillations for Kaidu River Basin, Xinjiang, China Increasing global warming has led to the incremental retreat of glaciers, which in turn affects the water supply of the rivers dependent on glacier melts. This is further affected by the increases in flooding that is attributable to heavy rains during the snowmelt season. An accurate estimation of streamflow is important for water resources planning and management. Therefore, this paper focuses on improving the streamflow forecast for Kaidu River Basin, situated at the north fringe of Yanqi basin on the south slope of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, China. The interannual and decadal scale oceanic-atmospheric oscillations, i.e.,Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO), are used to generate streamflow volumes for the peak season (April-October) and the water year, which is from October of the previous year to September of the current year for a period from 1955-2006. A data-driven model, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM), was developed that incorporated oceanic atmospheric oscillations to increase the streamflow lead time. Based on performance measures, predicted streamflow volumes are in agreement with the measured volumes. Sensitivity analyses, performed to evaluate the effect of individual and coupled oscillations, revealed a stronger presence of coupled PDO, NAO, and ENSO indices within the basin. The AMO index shows a pronounced effect when individually compared with the other oscillation modes. Additionally, model-forecasted streamflow is better than that for climatology. Overall, very good streamflow predictions are obtained using the SVM modeling approach. Furthermore, the LSSVM streamflow predictions outperform the predictions obtained from the most widely used feed-forward back-propagation models, artificial neural network, and multiple linear regression. The current paper contributes in improving the streamflow forecast lead time, and identified a coupled climate signal within the basin. The increased lead time can provide useful information to water managers in improving the planning and management of water resources within the Kaidu River Basin.

1926,"Clinopyroxene compositions in the Deccan and Rajmahal Traps and their bearing on magma types and evolution Electron probe analyses of clinopyroxenes from several areas of the Deccan and Rajmahal Traps consisting mostly of subalkalic and alkalic basalts, picritic basalts and a few dolerite dykes have been obtained. Evaluation of the data indicate the absence of pigeonite from subalkalic basalts that occur in close spatial association with mild or strongly alkalic basalts in areas such as Rajpipla, Navagam and central Kachchh. Co-existence of augite and pigeonite, however, has been noticed in subalkalic basalts/dykes and picritic basalts from a number of Deccan localities such as Sagar, Igatpuri, Kalsubai, Triambak, Pavagarh and Girnar besides the one sample from Rajmahal. Diopside, salite, and wollastonite-rich compositions dominate the basanites and foidites of Kachchh whereas chrome-diopside and saute are the main types in the picrite basalt samples from Anila, Botad and Paliyad in Saurashtra akin to those found in contiguous areas in the east from borehole flows at Dhandhuka and Wadhwan studied in detail previously. Compositional variations in zoned clinopyroxenes indicate differentiation of the parental magma and also mixing of different magma types (subalkalic and alkalic) from areas such as Igatpuri, Rajpipla and Kachchh. Based on host-rock chemistry, total alkalis-silica plot, CIPW norms, estimated temperatures of eruption and augite - pigeonite thermometry, it has been inferred that clinopyroxene compositions, especially the incidence of pigeonite, appear to be very sensitive to bulk chemistry of host rocks, especially their Na2O, K2O, SiO2, total iron and TiO2 contents. Non-quadrilateral cationic components in the clinopyroxenes, such as Al in tetrahedral and octahedral positions together with Si, Na, Ti and Cr abundances have been found to be useful to discriminate clinopyroxenes from alkalic and subalkalic basalt types besides inferences on the ferric iron component in them. Evaluation of host-rock compositions in the ternary olivine-clinopyroxene-quartz plot indicate polybaric conditions of crystallization and evolution especially in samples that are picritic (e.g. Pavagarh, Anila and Kachchh) and which could also breach the olivine-clinopyroxene-plagioclase thermal divide that exists in part between alkalic and subalkalic basalts under atmospheric conditions.

1927,"'Hidden Hot Springs' as a Source of Groundwater Fluoride and Severe Dental Fluorosis in Malawi Hidden hot springs likely impact rural water supplies in Malawi's Rift Valley with excess dissolved fluoride leading to localised endemic severe dental fluorosis. Predicting their occurrence is a challenge; Malawi's groundwater data archive is sporadic and incomplete which prevents the application of standard modelling techniques. A creative alternative method to predict hidden hot spring locations was developed using a synthesis of proxy indicators (geological, geochemical, dental) and is shown to be at least 75% effective. An exciting collaboration between geoscientists and dentists allowed corroboration of severe dental fluorosis with hydrogeological vulnerability. Thirteen hidden hot springs were identified based on synthesised proxy indicators. A vulnerability prediction map for the region was developed and is the first of its kind in Malawi. It allows improved groundwater fluoride prediction in Malawi's rift basin which hosts the majority of hot springs. Moreover, it allows dentists to recognise geological control over community oral health. Collaborative efforts have proven mutually beneficial, allowing both disciplines to conduct targeted research to improve community wellbeing and health and inform policy development in their respective areas. This work contributes globally in developing nations where incomplete groundwater data and vulnerability to groundwater contamination from hydrothermal fluoride exist in tandem.",
1928,"Use of Ionic Liquid Pretreated and Fermented Sugarcane Bagasse as an Adsorbent for Congo Red Removal A large amount of industrial wastewater containing pollutants including toxic dyes needs to be processed prior to its discharge into the environment. Biological materials such as sugarcane bagasse (SB) have been reported for their role as adsorbents to remove the dyes from water. In this study, the residue SB after fermentation was utilized for the dye removal. A combined pretreatment of NaOH and methyltrioctylammonium chloride was given to SB for lignin removal, and the pretreated SB was utilized for cellulase production from Bacillus aestuarii UE25. The strain produced 118 IU mL(-1) of endoglucanse and 70 IU mL(-1) of beta-glucosidase. Scanning electron microscopy and FTIR spectra showed lignin and cellulose removal in fermented SB. This residue was utilized for the adsorption of an azo dye, congo red (CR). The thermodynamic, isotherm and kinetics studies for the adsorption of CR revealed distinct adsorption features of SB. Untreated SB followed Langmuir isotherm, whereas pretreated SB and fermented SB obeyed the Freundlich isotherm model. The pseudo-second-order model fitted well for the studied adsorbents. The results of thermodynamic studies revealed spontaneous adsorption with negative standard free energy values. Untreated SB showed a 90.36% removal tendency at 303.15 K temperature, whereas the adsorbents comprised of pretreated and fermented SB removed about 98.35% and 97.70%, respectively. The study provided a strategy to utilize SB for cellulase production and its use as an adsorbent for toxic dyes removal.",
1929,"Agriculture and climate change in southeast asia and the middle east: Breeding, climate change adaptation, agronomy, and water security The agriculture of Southeast Asia and the Middle East is under threat due to vagaries of abiotic stress including climate change and water-related factors. With a particular focus on the challenges facing non-industrialized and developing countries, this paper attempts to create a framework for policymakers and planning commissions as well as increasing national and regional water stress awareness. The study elaborates the agriculture eminence, water provision, conventional water usage, and adverse consequences of water status under the changing climatic conditions and urban or industrial development. The study addresses the nature of problems, regional issues, current barriers, farmerâ€™s perceptions, and concrete efforts to save regional agriculture for sustainable food security. The consequences of climate change, water stress, and salinity have affected huge areas of developing countries from an economic and resource security perspective that leads to disaster and unstable law and order issues. Long-term planning over timescales beyond the human lifespan and anticipation of threats and opportunities is required. Consequently, an emergency plan is also needed for international, national, and regional footprints including procedures for climate change mitigation and to implement inclusive plans to combat prevailing poverty, social changes, and allied anticipated risks. It elaborates the attempts to provide a framework for policy makers and political understanding to check the hidden but viable issues relating risks of climate change in local and global scenario. It is concluded that a viable charter of climate proofing and domestication is the way to success from on-farm-to-lab and lab-to-field outreach to mitigate declining food issues. The regional and international collaborative efforts are focused to modernizing crop genetics, agronomy, field-to-fork scrutiny, and adaptation training to increase quantity and quality of food with sustainable use of water.

1930,"Inductive induced polarization effect in heliborne time-domain electromagnetic data for uranium exploration, northern part of Cuddapah Basin, India The Peddagattu, Lambapur, Chitrial and Koppunuru uranium deposits along the northern margins of the Cuddapah Basin are confined to the middle Proterozoic unconformity interface between Archean basement granites and the overlying resistive quartzites. Negative transients observed in the coincident loop heliborne time-domain electromagnetic (HTEM) data over these deposits (occurring in outliers) are believed to be due to thick polarizable conductive zones occurring along the unconformity. Similar negative HTEM responses are recorded over the Gorukunta Tanda outlier. A ground spectral induced polarization (SIP) survey conducted over the outlier and ground geologic observations indicated an altered basement/regolith with thickness up to 5 m below 20-30 m thick quartzite. Interpretation of Cole-Cole parameters computed from the SIP data indicated a change in the dispersion. These Cole-Cole parameters were used in modeling negative HTEM data assuming a polarizable plate placed in a layered earth at a depth of approximately 50 m using the CSIRO LeroiAir program. A negative dBz/dt response in the late channels indicated that the negatives can be explained in terms of inductive induced polarization effects. Modeling of HTEM dBz/dt data for the profile through the Lambapur uranium deposit and the Gorukunta Tanda reveals the presence of a polarizable lithologic unit at a depth of approximately 40 m. This unit is interpreted as an argillic alteration of basement, with the presence of clay and/or disseminated sulfides as evidenced from the core extracted from the boreholes at depths below the highly resistive quartzite. Uranium mineralization is closely associated with altered basement and sulfides along the unconformity where the distinct negative electromagnetic (EM) signature is recorded. Furthermore, there exists a good correlation between the uranium mineralization grade and the thickness versus the averaged late-channel negative HTEM response over the known deposits. The negative EM response helped in locating the new target areas for uranium exploration.",

Consumer tap water samples were collected from different parts of the water-distribution system of the city. Duplicate samples collected from the sites were extracted with organic solvent, pentane and analysed using a gas chromatograph equipped with Ni-63 electron capture detector. Results indicate a variation in haloform concentration in different seasons of the year. A maximum concentration, ranging from 67.0-70.5 mu g/l was observed during the summer. However, the mean level of chloroform was below the permissible level of 30 mu g/l recommended by WHO (1984).",
1932,"Radon concentration in hot springs of the touristic city of Sarein and methods to reduce radon in water The aim of this research was to measure the efficiency of various simple methods to decrease the concentration of radon in hot springs of the touristic city of Sarein (a touristic city in northwest Iran). With the aid of ""RAD7"" radon detector, concentrations in water varied from 212 Bq m(-3) to 3890 Bq m(-3). Using 250 mL. vials half-filled with water samples, our research showed that when the temperature of the water increased from 17 degrees C to 27 degrees C, the radon concentration decreased from 3230 Bq m(-3) to 745 Bq m(-3). The mixing of the sample at a speed of 500 rpm for 12 min led to a radon reduction of about 70%. Aerating the water sample with 0.2 L min(-1) of ambient air resulted in a 90% decrease in radon concentration in 6 min. Strong exponential correlations (> 95%) were reported, which verified that the effectiveness of these methods in reducing dissolved gas in the waters used would be high. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

1933,"Phytoplankton community structure during monsoon transition period in the Lembeh strait of north Sulawesi, Indonesia Phytoplankton community structure based on photosynthetic pigments in the Lembeh strait was studied in April 2017, during the period of monsoon transition. With data of the spatial distribution of phytoplankton community structures and environmental factors, the main factors leading to the changes in phytoplankton community structure and distribution of phytoplankton abundance were discussed. Our results show that the phosphate concentration in the north of the strait was higher than that in the south, while the distribution of nitrogen concentration was just the opposite. The silicate concentration had a significance high concentration in the bottom water of the northern strait, indicating that there was a sinking ocean current from the north. Different from previous surveys, the N/P ratio of water ranges from 2.6 to 4.56, proving that nitrogen is the nutrient limiting factor in this survey, which was due to increased phosphorus concentrations due to continuous heavy rains. The main pigments were Chl b, 19-hexfucoxanthin and fucoxanthin during the period of monsoon transition. Chl a concentration was significantly higher in the north of the strait than in the south, and Chl a concentration at surface was higher than that at bottom. This is because the thrive of cyanobacteria in the northern strait, which were the main group in the Lembeh strait during monsoon transition. They can grow and reproduce in the nutrient-poor sea water, since they can use phosphonates as a source of phosphorus during metabolic processes. Compared with surveys conducted during SE monsoonal period, the abundance of phytoplankton in monsoon transition period was significantly lower. Because the upwelling brought sufficient nutrients to the water, which meet the require of phytoplankton growth, allowing phytoplankton to grow well in SE monsoon. On the whole, the results show that the changes in phytoplankton community structure and distribution of phytoplankton abundance during the monsoon transition period in the Lembeh strait is mainly affected by nutrients.

1934,"Multiple exposure pathways and health risk assessment of heavy metal(loid)s for children living in fourth-tier cities in Hubei Province In the past, most research focused on the children living near a typical contaminated area but ignored the health risks of children living in the fourth or fifth tier cities without typical contaminated sources. These cities are now facing a series of problems, such as serious environmental pollution, undeveloped health system and so on. Furthermore, the development of modern logistics for food delivery has altered lifestyles that directly impact diets and eating patterns. In this study, multiple exposure pathways and health risks of children to heavy metal(loid)s were studied based on questionnaire-based surveys and field sampling of soil, dust, fine particulates, drinking water and food. We found that Pb, Cd and Mn levels in environmental samples were very high indicating a serious pollution problem. Inhalation exposure via aerosol particles was the most important pathway and was greater than exposure by food ingestion. The hazard index for Mn via aerosol particles was >1 even at the 5th percentile and Mn levels in urine was 10 times higher than those of people living in typical contaminated areas. The total incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for all metal(loid)s was also higher than the threshold at the 95th percentile. This study highlights health risks to children living in fourth tier cities and the importance of air pollution control to protect heavy metal exposure for children.",
1935,"Structural Controls of Gold Deposit Mineralization in Zarshouran Mine, Takab, Iran Zarshuran gold deposit is located in northenwest Iran at Takab region. Zarshuran gold deposit has reserve of 6.74 million tons with 1 gram per ton cut off grade and 4.01 grams per ton average gradeZarshuran gold mineralization is similar in many ways to scattered epithermal deposit in sedimentary rocks, especially carbonates (carlin type). Deposit contains very fine grained scattered gold and high content of arsenic and sulfide. The hosted rocks for mineralization are Black shale and Chaldagh limestone. Silicification, argilic-seserisitic and alunitealteration are the most important alteration in this region. The studied area of Zarshuran is a part of Tabriz-Bazman igneous sub-zone and it is part of Imankhan anticline. The main faults of this region (Tabriz-Bazman) form a network which is dependent on a riedel type shear zone. In this work, first, the DataMine and Rockworks software has been used to study the structure of regional faults and folds (like determining fold axis, fold dependent fractures, etc.), then faults and fold dependent joints are divided into groups. Geological dependency of different structural elements of the region has been matched on third order branched fractures mechanism of clockwise shear area with final trend of N130 and N155 and mineralization is occurred along extension of these trends. Field surveys, fractures and boreholes investigations showed that mineralization and ore deposition is consistent with the area fractures.",
1936,"Adsorption behavior of tetracycline by extracellular polymeric substrates extracted from Klebsiella sp J1 The extracellular polymeric substrate (EPS) extracted from Klebsiella sp. J1 was used to adsorb low concentrations of tetracycline, and the efficiency and mechanism of tetracycline adsorption by EPS from strain J1 were studied. Adsorption efficiency was evaluated at different conditions. Results showed that optimal adsorption efficiency was 71.68 % with 60 mg L-1 of EPS from strain J1 and 90 mu L of 10 % (w/v) CaCl2 in 100 mL of tetracycline solution (80 mu g L-1) with pH of 8.0. Experimental data was fitted well with Langmuir, Freundlich isotherm, and pseudo-second-order models. Analyses of E value, Ea value, thermodynamics, zeta potential variation, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra proved that chemisorption was the main adsorption type and bridging was the main adsorption mechanism. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that adsorptive reaction was exothermic from 20 to 40 A degrees C. In addition, humic acid (HA) showed little effect on the tetracycline adsorption by MFX.",
1937,"Mise-a-la-masse survey for an auriferous sulfide deposit A mise-a-la-masse survey was carried out in Bhukia area, Banswara district, Rajasthan, India for auriferous sulfide occurrences. This area was originally surveyed for copper mineralization. Exploratory drilling, however, proved it to be economically not viable. The area was reopened for geophysical surveys when grab samples indicated the presence of gold. Initial geophysical surveys for copper mineralization showed electromagnetic, induced polarization, and resistivity anomalies. At first, one borehole was drilled for gold exploration on the basis of initial geophysical surveys. It encountered massive sulfide mineralization in association with gold. Borehole logging and a mise-a-la-masse survey were carried out in this borehole. Three further boreholes drilled on the basis of the mise-a-la-masse results encountered massive sulfide mineralization in association with gold. One of the three boreholes, 100 m from the first borehole along strike, was used for another set of mise-a-la-masse measurements. A composite equipotential map was prepared using the results of mise-a-la-masse results of both the boreholes. The equipotential contours show a north-northwest-south-southeast trend of mineralization, The boreholes drilled on the basis of the mise-ala-masse results have delineated a strike length of more than 500 m of gold-bearing sulfide mineralization. The sulfide content ranges from 10 to 40% and gold concentration ranges from 2 to 6 ppm. The dip and plunge of the lode, as anticipated from the mise-a-la-masse results, are toward the west and north, respectively. Mise-a-la-masse surveys are continuing in the adjoining areas.",
1938,"Improving regional water scarcity footprint characterization factors of an available water remaining (AWARE) method Increasing water demand and decreasing freshwater availability in an area can cause water scarcity leading to damage to human health, ecosystem quality, and natural resources. Many countries around the world, including Thailand, have recognized the importance of this problem. The available water remaining (AWARE) characterization model provides water scarcity footprint characterization factors (WSF CFs) for assessing the WSF of products. AWARE CFs were prepared from WaterGAP model's data and are available in watershed and country levels. They were not provided for specific areas and could not accurately explain water scarcity situations in certain regions, potentially leading to inappropriate water management. This work calculates the annual and monthly local CFs from local data in the Chao Phraya watershed in Thailand. The monthly local CFs with local environmental water requirement (EWR) calculations ranged from 0.10 to 100. The mean difference between AWARE CFs and local CFs was statistically significant. The most sensitive parameters for local CFs in the dry season were water availability (WA) and agricultural water consumption and that in the wet season was WA. The weighting of AWARE CFs by each type of water consumption and an aggregate of AWARE CFs for product production has been recommended for WSF assessment. The AWARE methodology was modified to assess the individual water scarcity of each water user based on the order of priority. For the Chao Phraya watershed, the ranges of the monthly local individual CFs using local EWR calculations of domestic, environment, livestock, agriculture, and industry were 0.10-0.33, 0.10-0.37, 0.10-0.37,0.10-100, and 0.10-100, respectively. This assessment of individual water scarcity is helpful for prioritizing the level and timing of water use to minimize their impacts on critical water scarcity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

1939,"Determination of antibiotics in Brazilian surface waters using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry A liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of antibiotics in water was developed and applied to Brazilian surface waters. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefalexin (CEF), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR), sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline (TET), and trimethoprim were selected as target compounds due to their high consumption pattern in Brazil. LC and MS conditions were optimized to produce the maximum analytic response for each compound. Anion exchange and polymeric solid-phase extraction cartridges, in series, were employed during the extraction procedures. Recovery, linear range, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification were calculated. LOD varied from 0.13 ng L(-1) for CIP and NOR to 0.76 ng L(-1) for TET. Surface water samples from the Atibaia watershed (SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil) were analyzed. Results showed that seasonal and anthropogenic aspects dictated the levels of antibiotics in the samples. An overall frequency of detection of 55% was observed during the rainy period, whereas a higher percentage (88%) was noticed for samples collected during the dry season. In the Atibaia River, sample concentrations ranged from 29 ng L(-1) for CEF to 0.5 ng L(-1) for NOR. In a sewage-affected stream, however, concentrations up to 2422 ng L(-1) CEF were found.",
1940,"Influence of agricultural activity on soil morphological and physicochemical properties on sandy beach ridges along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia Along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, beach ridges are formed with interspersed swales, which are referred to locally as beach ridges interspersed with swales (BRIS). Although BRIS soils are regarded as problematic lowland soils for agriculture because of their very sandy texture and concomitant infertility, agricultural activities in such soils have been recently increasing. This study was conducted to characterize the BRIS soils and to evaluate the influence of agricultural activities on soil characteristics and fertility. Three 1-km transects from the shoreline running inland were established; two transects passed through the experimental farm of Cherating Station of the Malaysian Agriculture Research Development Institute while the other transect passed through an adjacent remnant forest. The soils located close to the shoreline and that further inland were classified as Typic Quartzipsamments and Typic Haplohumods, respectively. The soils had a very high sand content, occasionally exceeding 95%, were acidic and had low cation exchange capacity (CEC) values. While soil organic matter was the determining factor for cation exchange capacity, the regression slope of CEC against soil carbon in the Bhs horizon of the Spodosols was different from that in the other horizons. Because the effective CEC value was much lower than the CEC value, the development of the negative charges on variable-charge surfaces seemed to be largely restricted under acidic conditions. For the Spodosols, the levels of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) oxides extracted with acid ammonium oxalate and those oxides with dithionite-citrate-sodium bicarbonate were negligible in the A to E horizons, but they showed sharp peaks in the Bhs horizons. Agricultural activities affected the soil in three ways. First, the A horizon of the farm soil had lower amounts of total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) compared with the forest, suggesting insufficient input of plant litter to sustain original levels of soil organic matter. Second, although the levels of pH, and exchangeable calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), were higher in the farm soil than the forest, exchangeable potassium (K) was occasionally not detected despite fertilizer application. This finding might be due to the preferential adsorption of divalent cations over monovalent K on the variable negative charges on soil organic matter surfaces as well as limited development of the charge sites in the sandy soil. Finally, the Spodosols under agricultural land use had the highest peak of available phosphorus (P) in the Bhs horizon despite its low level in the overlying A and E horizons. While phosphate is known to be immobile relative to other anions, our finding suggest the downward translocation of mineral P from fertilizer and its retention in the Bhs horizon. Based on the findings, soil organic matter was very important in BRIS soil. Increasing organic matter levels of the soils can improve soil fertility through enhancing cation exchange capacity and the resulting increase in basic cations.",
1941,"Lysimeter study of nitrogen losses and nitrogen use efficiency of Northern Chinese wheat A study was conducted in the lysimeters and rain-out shelter facility at Shandong Agricultural University to investigate the impact of nitrogen (N) fertilization management practices and irrigation on the losses of N and N use efficiencies of winter wheat in the Huang Huai Hai Plains of northern China. 4 factors, each with two levels, including wheat varieties (SM15 and JM19), irrigation level (well water and deficit water), N fertilizer type (manure fertilizer and urea), N fertilizer rates (90 and 180 kg N ha(-1)) were applied in duplicate over three wheat growing seasons from 2009 to 2012. Ammonia volatilization rates (AVR) were highest immediately following fertilizer application and declined over 20 days after fertilization, AVR following urea is significantly greater than following manure application and is largely affected by soil NH4+-N concentrations. Cumulative ammonia volatilization (CAV) from urea was approximately three times that from manure. AV accounts for most of N losses and may account for 25% or more of applied N. Leaching losses increased with N fertilization concentration. Pre-winter leaching losses accounted for 69.6-100% of total leaching loss. Total N losses through AV and leaching during the whole wheat growing season were estimated to range from 30 to 60% of applied N. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and N uptake efficiency (NUpE) of the cultivar SM15 is 10.1 and 19.8% greater than JM19 by average under well watered conditions, respectively, but NUE and N utilization efficiency (NUtE) of JM19 were 17.5% and 21.8% higher than SM15 under water stress condition, respectively. In addition, the difference of crop N use efficiency (NUE,) and crop N uptake efficiency (NUpM between two varieties was inconsistent to NUE and NUpE. The following results were implicated from this study: (1) ammonia volatilization could be reduced by 66.6% through manure application instead of urea application; (2) reducing fertilizer and irrigation supply during pre-winter stage could be a effective method to reduce N loss in the region; (3) all treatments in this study lead to progressively lower soil fertility except for the 180 kg N ha-1 manure which is able to maintain soil fertility; (4) wheat variety, N fertilizer level, irrigation amount and their interactions have obviously impact on NUE parameters.

1942,"The role of external fluid in the Shanggusi dynamic granitic magma system, East Qinling, China: Quantitative integration of textural and chemical data It is well recognized that various degrees of mantle-derived materials are incorporated in the formation of granite, and mantle-derived mafic melts are generally considered to mix with crustal felsic melt. Here, however, we provide an example of the Shanggusi leucocratic granite where external mantle-derived hydrous fluid, rather than mafic melt, might be incorporated into a nearly pure crustal granitic melt system. Field observations suggest that the Shanggusi granite consists of granite porphyry, granite dyke and granitic pegmatite and they have consistent zircon U-Pb ages and molybdenite Re-Os ages. The marginal pegmatite, interconnected miarolitic cavities, heterogeneous molybdenite mineralization and significant variation of micro-texture of the Shanggusi granite physically indicate that strong fluid activities occurred in the granitic system. Accumulation of quartz and K-feldspar and bulk-rock major element data imply that fractional crystallization played an important role in the evolution of the granitic system which, however, cannot reasonably explain the significant trace elements fractionation, non-CHARAC trace elements behavior and simultaneous concave and convex REE tetrad effect of the Shanggusi granite, but which can be best explained by the influence of external fluorine-rich hydrous fluid. Importantly, the chemical fractionation, including bulk-rock trace elements and isotopes, is closely correlated with quantitative textural parameter L. (the average length of the four largest quartz crystals in each sample), indicating that the vast majority of physical and chemical characteristics of the granitic system were most likely controlled by the wholesale fluid flow. The Shanggusi granite is highly siliceous (SiO2 = 74.91-79.50 wt.%, except granitic pegmatite with SiO2 = 67.41 wt.%), extremely poor in mafic minerals, and with relative homogeneous bulk-rock major element chemistry and mineralogy, which approximate experimentally pure crustal melt that generated by dehydration melting of sedimentary rocks. The mantle-derived Nd-Pb-O isotopic features, however, require a great deal of contributions from mantle materials. Therefore, it is proposed that external mantle-derived fluid was infiltrated into the Shanggusi granitic system at least before emplacement, and fluid-melt mixing may be an important but not easily recognized part in granite origin.

1943,"Successional trends in Sonoran Desert abandoned agricultural fields in northern Mexico Excessive ground-water use and saline intrusion to the aquifer led, in less than three decades, to an increase in abandoned agricultural fields at La Costa de Hermosillo, within the Sonoran Desert. Using a chronosequence from years since abandonment, patterns of field succession were developed. Contrary to most desert literature species replacement was round, both in fields with and without saline intrusion. Seasonal photosynthetic capacity as well as water and nitrogen use efficiencies were different in dominant early and late successional plant species. These ecological findings provided a framework for a general explanation of species dominance and replacement within abandoned agricultural fields in the Sonoran Desert. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Not only drinking water and staple food such as rice contribute to the total As intake, but also more locally used food. This study focuses on three very different regions in Asia affected by As contaminated groundwater. The pattern of food is varying in these regions and so is the As intake. Similar to all regions is the accumulation of As in agricultural soils-still available as As source even when As is banned from irrigation water.",
1945,"Evidence for Elevated Levels of Arsenic in Public Wells of Bangladesh Due To Improper Installation One of the mainstays of mitigation to reduce the exposure of the rural population of Bangladesh to arsenic (As) from private, mostly <90-m deep wells over the past 15 years has been the installation of over 300,000 deeper community wells. A comprehensive testing campaign previously conducted across a 180 km(2) of area of Bangladesh identified 9 out of total of 927 wells >90 m deep that contained >50 Âµg/L arsenic. We show here that for five of these nine wells, conductivity profiles obtained after spiking the well bore with salt indicate a shallow leak that could explain the high As in the well water. In two of the five leaky wells, the presence of additional screens at the depth of the leak was documented with a downhole camera. The downhole camera did not detect anomalies in the construction of the remaining three leaky wells or in the four wells that did not leak. The four wells that did not leak were all >150-m deep and located in two villages separated by less than 500 m. Excluding these two villages and a handful of leaky wells, the results indicate an aquifer that is consistently low in As over a sizeable area at depths >90 m. Isolated cases of public wells that are elevated in As that have been reported elsewhere in Bangladesh may therefore reflect improper installation rather than actual contamination of the deep aquifer.",
1946,"Study of ferrous iron oxidation in Morocco drinking water in an airlift reactor Although ferrous iron removal from drinking water by aeration has been studied for a while, there is still an uncertainty on the performance and the physicochemical mechanisms of iron(II) oxidation [S.K. Sharma, B. Petrusevski, J.C. Schippers, J. Water. Supply Res. Technol. Aqua, 54 (2005) 239-247]. A possible reason is the autocatalytic effect of ferric hydroxide particles, but this assumption is never validated quantitatively in practice because this catalytic effect has been investigated only under batch laboratory-controlled conditions. In this work, iron(II) oxidation has been studied on synthetic waters in a 63 L split-rectangular airlift reactor, the hydrodynamics and the mass transfer properties of which were described previously [N. El Azher, B. Gourich, C. Vial, M. Belhaj Soulami, A. Bouzidi, M. Ziyad, Biochem. Eng. J., 23 (2005) 161-167]. Experiments were carried out both under semi-batch and continuous flow conditions. The kinetic parameters derived from the experiments were consistent with the literature both under unsteady and steady-state conditions. Experimental results showed that the airlift reactor allowed simultaneously good mixing, mass transfer and pH control despite the strong sensitivity of the oxidation kinetics to pH. Data confirmed that recycling about 50 mg/L of ferric hydroxide particles in a slurry phase could decrease drastically the time necessary to reach the minimum admissible concentration of iron(II). For example, residence time could be reduced by a factor six at pH 7.0 under steady-state conditions, which may avoid the need for a further pH increase. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

1947,"Geological characterization and environmental implications of the placement of the Morelia Dump, MichoacÃ¡n, Central Mexico The landfill of Morelia, the capital city of the state of MichoacÃ¡n in central-western Mexico, is located 12 km west of the city and has operated since 1997 without a structure engineered and designed to control the generation in situ of biogas and leachates. A geological evaluation of the landfill site is presented in this paper. The results indicate that the site lacks ideal impermeable subsurface strata. The subsurface strata consist of highly fractured basaltic lava flows (east-west fault and fracture system trend) and sand-size cineritic material with high permeability and porosity. Geochemical analysis of groundwater from Morelia's municipal aquifer shows a high concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, As) exceeding the Mexican environmental regulations, along with the presence of some organic pollutants (phenols). Analyses of samples of the landfill's permanent leachate ponds show very high concentrations of the same contaminants. Samples were taken from the leachate pond and from nearby water-wells during the rainy season (summer 1997) and the dry season (spring 1997, 1998, and 1999). In all cases, the concentration of contaminants registered exceeded the standards for drinking water of the World Health Organization (American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, and Water Pollution Control Federation, 2000). Some metal contaminants could be leaching directly from the landfill.",
1948,"Potable water quality assessment of traditionally used springs in a hilly town of Bhaderwah, Jammu and Kashmir, India The quality of spring water and its suitability for human consumption is determined by examining its physicochemical and microbiological characteristics. Preliminary investigations were conducted to determine the potability of seven traditionally used springs in the highly populated hill town of Bhaderwah in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The water analysis was performed for various physico-chemical and microbial parameters during April 2019-March 2020. Water temperature, TDS, EC, pH, DO, free CO(2), total alkalinity, total hardness, Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+), K(+), CO(3)(2-), HCOÖ¿(3), Clâ€¾, NOÖ¿(3,) PO(4)(3-), SO(4)(2-), total coliforms, and thermotolerant coliforms were all measured. Eleven physical and chemical characteristics were used to generate the Water Quality Index. The Piper diagram demonstrated the predominance of Ca(2+)-HCOÖ¿(3) water types, whereas the Schoeller diagram indicated that all springs had a similar lithological origin. The chemical composition of springs tested met the required criteria for drinking water quality. The microbiological indicators, on the other hand, did not satisfy the criteria except for Eidgah spring, which lacked thermotolerant coliforms. Our results on spring water potability indicate that the town's most dependable springs are susceptible to anthropogenic contamination and therefore need treatment prior to use. Apart from frequent monitoring, the responsible municipal corporation is expected to develop comprehensive plans to rehabilitate and revitalise these vulnerable drinking water sources.",
1949,"A deep drillcore from the Morokweng impact structure, South Africa: petrography, geochemistry, and constraints on the crater size The Morokweng impact structure in South Africa was formed 145 Ma ago, at the time of the minor mass extinction that marks the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. Previous size estimates for the Morokweng impact structure ranged between 70 and 340 kin, and those workers favoring a very large size speculated on the role that the Morokweng impact might have played in relation to this mass extinction. Consequently, the actual size of this impact structure has wide-ranging implications. Petrographic and geochemical analyses, combined with SHRIMP U-Pb single zircon chronology, of a >3400 m long drillcore from about 40 km west of the center of the Morokweng impact structure show that this borehole is most likely located outside the impact structure, limiting the maximum crater diameter to <80 km. While the formation of a <80 km impact structure in continental terrane probably did not engender global biological consequences, it is possible that a series of impact events at J/K boundary time could have caused environmental stress on a worldwide scale. The terrestrial impact crater record does list several smaller structures of similar ages to that of the Morokweng structure. The results of this study are also significant for South African Archean geology. Late Archean (2.6-2.8 Ga) granitoids in the crust of the Kaapvaal Craton are much more widespread than previously thought. The overprint of the Namaquan-Kibaran orogenesis at 1.2-0.9 Ga along the western and southern margin of the craton is significant even in the far North West Province of South Africa.

1950,"Classification of the type of eco-geological environment of a coal mine district: A case study of an ecologically fragile region in Western China Western China is characterized by abundant coal resources but it also faces the problems of poor water resources and fragile ecological environment, which have become more prominent due to the large-scale exploitation of coal resources in recent years. Shennan coal mine district is located at the border area between the Loess Plateau and Mu Us Desert of Northern Shaanxi province, which belongs to the typical arid and semi-arid ecologically fragile region of Western China, The geological features and ecological environmental characteristics of this district show wide variations with spatial distribution. However, intense coal mining activities will inevitably lead to further deterioration of the already fragile ecological and geological (eco-geological) environment, making recovery increasingly difficult. Therefore, investigating the different characteristics and classifying the types of the eco-geological environment are of great significance to in selecting appropriate mining methods, which would help in realizing coordinated exploitation of coal resources and environmental protection before coal exploitation. In this study, based on the remote sensing and geographic information system technology, Landsat8 remote sensing image, regional geological data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), borehole data, hydrological data were analyzed. Furthermore, the eco-geological environment of the study area was classified into three types with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, surface elevation, terrain slope, surface lithology, geomorphic type, and hydrographic net are selected as the main control factors to classify eco-geological environment type. Each control factor was quantified using ArcGIS, with the aid of MATLAB 2014b as the computing platform, eco-geological environment of study area is classified into three types combining weighted fuzzy C-means (WFCM) clustering algorithm and the weight of each main control factor determined by fuzzy Delphi analytic hierarchy process (FDAHP) method. Finally, the classification of the eco-geological environment was verified through a field survey of the Hongliulin coal mine, and the results showed high accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1951,"Geomorphology of Lake Lisan terraces along the eastern coast of the Dead Sea, Jordan Lake Lisan, the lake that filled the Jordan graben during the Last Glacial, left behind a well developed sequence of erosional and depositional shore terraces in the south east of the current Dead Sea. These terraces record a series of stillstands that were caused by small transgressions within an overall trend of falling lake levels. The terraces were observed in places where they had not been identified previously. The morphology of the terraces was investigated in six cross-sections using differential GPS altimetry. The levels of the terraces range between -370 and -148 m a.s.l. The high stand of Lake Lisan at -148 m correlates well with the high level of -150 m reported by Bowman and Gross [Bowman, D., Gross, T., 1992. The highest stand of Lake Lisan: similar to 150 meters below MSL Israel journal of Earth-Science 41, 233-237.] along the western coast of Lake Lisan. The lake terraces are horizontal, elongated and tectonically undisturbed. and have a sub-horizontal foreshore (tread) with an average slope of 8.2 degrees and steep backshore cliff (riser) with an average slope of 17.7 degrees. The six cross-sections show a good altitudinal correlation between their terraces. Moreover, the terraces appear in undisturbed continuity on the aerial photos. These morphological characteristics demonstrate that the retreat of the lake was a result of substantial climatic changes, not of tectonic subsidence. In-situ stromatolites were found on most of the terraces, reflecting a shallow water environment and emphasizing that these terraces are recessional. Well-developed desert varnish and Tafoni observed on blocks sitting on the terrace surfaces imply a long period of exposure and a low rate of post lacustrine erosion. The formation of Lisan terraces is constrained mainly by coastal slope, water depth and underlying lithology. The morphological analysis of these terraces allows identification of two kinds of pseudo-terraces, which were formed as a result of tread or riser destruction. U/Th and OSL dating allowed the dating of three events within the lake level curve more precisely. The high level of -148 m occurred at 30.5 +/- 0.22 ka BP, consistent with the Heinrich Event 3 and Dansgaard-Oeschger stadial 5, the coldest period in the NGRIP Greenland Ice Core record. The next lower terrace at -154 m was formed at 22.9 ka BP +/- 0.29 and corresponds to the stadial 2C, the final phase of the Last High Glacial. The correlation between the Lisan high stands and climatic stadials suggests that Northern-Hemispheric cold periods led to periods with a more positive water balance in the Near East.

Nearly all of them have been directed towards optimizing biosorption parameters to obtain the highest removal efficiency while the rest of them are concerned with the biosorption mechanism. Combinations of FTIR, SEM-EDX, TEM as well as classical methods such as titrations are extremely useful in determining the main processes on the surfaces of biosorbents. Diverse functional groups represented by carboxyl, hydroxyl, sulfate and amino groups play significant roles in the biosorption process. Solution pH normally has a large impact on biosorption performance. In brief, ion exchange and complexation can be pointed out as the most prevalent mechanisms for the biosorption of most heavy metals.",
1953,"Climate Change in the Mekong River Delta and Key Concerns on Future Climate Threats The Mekong River Delta in Vietnam is the largest agriculture and aquaculture production region of the nation. As the most downstream part of the Mekong River to both the East Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, the majority of the Delta is slightly under 2 m above sea level. Historically and practically, the people of the Delta have settled in the highest densities along the river and banks of the connected canals. Human life, agriculture and aquaculture production, and domestic water supplies in the Delta depend highly on the meteorological and hydrological regimes of the region. However, Delta livelihoods are sensitive and could be threatened by climate change and hydrological cycles. Future climate projection from the regional climate model indicates that the Mekong River Delta region will likely be warmer in the future with longer and drier summers. Seasonal patterns could be altered under the influence of global warming. Moreover, changes in climate patterns in the upstream region of the Mekong River may affect the flood regime of the Mekong Delta, which may lead to an extension of the current boundaries of flooding patterns. These changes raise many concerns, especially in terms of those who make their living from agriculture and aquaculture, because of their significant potential for creating new environmental challenges in the Mekong River Delta.",
1954,"Enhanced surface warming and accelerated snow melt in the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau induced by absorbing aerosols Numerical experiments with the NASA finite-volume general circulation model show that heating of the atmosphere by dust and black carbon can lead to widespread enhanced warming over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and accelerated snow melt in the western TP and Himalayas. During the boreal spring, a thick aerosol layer, composed mainly of dust transported from adjacent deserts and black carbon from local emissions, builds up over the Indo-Gangetic Plain, against the foothills of the Himalaya and the TP. The aerosol layer, which extends from the surface to high elevation (similar to 5 km), heats the mid-troposphere by absorbing solar radiation. The heating produces an atmospheric dynamical feedback-the so-called elevated-heat-pump (EHP) effect, which increases moisture, cloudiness, and deep convection over northern India, as well as enhancing the rate of snow melt in the Himalayas and TP. The accelerated melting of snow is mostly confined to the western TP, first slowly in early April and then rapidly from early to mid-May. The snow cover remains reduced from mid-May through early June. The accelerated snow melt is accompanied by similar phases of enhanced warming of the atmosphere-land system of the TP, with the atmospheric warming leading the surface warming by several days. Surface energy balance analysis shows that the short-wave and long-wave surface radiative fluxes strongly offset each other, and are largely regulated by the changes in cloudiness and moisture over the TP. The slow melting phase in April is initiated by an effective transfer of sensible heat from a warmer atmosphere to land. The rapid melting phase in May is due to an evaporation-snow-land feedback coupled to an increase in atmospheric moisture over the TP induced by the EHP effect.",
1955,"Coastal Forests and Groundwater: Using Case Studies to Understand the Effects of Drivers and Stressors for Resource Management Forests are receiving more attention for the ecosystem goods and services they provide and the potential change agents that may affect forest health and productivity. Highlighting case examples from coastal forests in South Carolina, USA, we describe groundwater processes with respect to stressors and potential responses of a wetland-rich forested landscape, the roles that this area has served, and the need for water resource data to inform forest management decisions. Forested lands in the southeastern U.S. coastal plain provide a rich set of goods and services for the region, and in one case, the Francis Marion National Forest acts as a buffer to urbanization from the surrounding Charleston metropolitan area. Information from two decades of studies in the forested watersheds there may inform scientists and managers in other coastal forested systems. The common hydrological theme in this region, which has a higher average annual rainfall ( 1370 mm) than the annual potential evapotranspiration ( PET = 1135 mm), is a shallow (< 3 m) water table condition that supports a large range of natural wetlands and also creates management challenges across the region. Modest changes in the position of the water table can lead to either groundwater flooding and concomitant management challenges for forest services, or ecosystem stresses related to dry conditions in wetlands during times of below-normal precipitation or due to groundwater withdrawal. Development pressures have also stressed forest resources through the extraction of materials such as timber and sand mining, and the conversion to housing construction materials. These areas are also targeted for land development, to meet housing demands. In this paper, we discuss the role of groundwater in coastal forests and highlight opportunities for collaborative studies to better inform forest resource management.",
1956,"Groundwater Arsenic Contamination in the Ganga River Basin: A Future Health Danger This study highlights the severity of arsenic contamination in the Ganga River basin (GRB), which encompasses significant geographic portions of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Tibet. The entire GRB experiences elevated levels of arsenic in the groundwater (up to 4730 mu g/L), irrigation water (similar to 1000 mu g/L), and in food materials (up to 3947 mu g/kg), all exceeding theWorld Health Organization's standards for drinking water, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization's standard for irrigation water (100 mu g/L), and the Chinese Ministry of Health's standard for food in South Asia (0.15 mg/kg), respectively. Several individuals demonstrated dermal, neurological, reproductive, cognitive, and cancerous effects; many children have been diagnosed with a range of arsenicosis symptoms, and numerous arsenic-induced deaths of youthful victims are reported in the GRB. Victims of arsenic exposure face critical social challenges in the form of social isolation and hatred by their respective communities. Reluctance to establish arsenic standards and unsustainable arsenic mitigation programs have aggravated the arsenic calamity in the GRB and put millions of lives in danger. This alarming situation resembles a ticking time bomb. We feel that after 29 years of arsenic research in the GRB, we have seen the tip of the iceberg with respect to the actual magnitude of the catastrophe; thus, a reduced arsenic standard for drinking water, testing all available drinking water sources, and sustainable and cost-effective arsenic mitigation programs that include the participation of the people are urgently needed.",
1957,"Estimating the relative efficiency of brazilian publicly and privately owned water utilities: A stochastic cost frontier approach This paper assesses cost efficiencies of Brazilian public and private companies of water supply. To measure the efficiency, we used a stochastic frontier model derived from the translog family - a specification similar to a Cobb- Douglas including a quadratic term in log output. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood using Brazilian data for the year 2002. Statistical inference leads to the conclusion that there is no evidence that private firms and public firms are significantly different in terms of efficiency measurements.",
1958,"Effective Magnetic MOFs Adsorbent for the Removal of Bisphenol A, Tetracycline, Congo Red and Methylene Blue Pollutions A magnetic metal-organic frameworks adsorbent (Fe(3)O(4)@MIL-53(Al)) was prepared by a typical solvothermal method for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA), tetracycline (TC), congo red (CR), and methylene blue (MB). The prepared Fe(3)O(4)@MIL-53(Al) composite adsorbent was well characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The influence of adsorbent quantity, adsorption time, pH and ionic strength on the adsorption of the mentioned pollutants were also studied by a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The adsorption capacities were found to be 160.9 mg/g for BPA, 47.8 mg/g for TC, 234.4 mg/g for CR, 70.8 mg/g for MB, respectively, which is superior to the other reported adsorbents. The adsorption of BPA, TC, and CR were well-fitted by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, while MB followed the Freundlich model, while the adsorption kinetics data of all pollutants followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The thermodynamic values, including the enthalpy change (Î”HÂ°), the Gibbs free energy change (Î”GÂ°), and entropy change (Î”SÂ°), showed that the adsorption processes were spontaneous and exothermic entropy-reduction process for BPA, but spontaneous and endothermic entropy-increasing processes for the others. The Fe(3)O(4)@MIL-53(Al) was also found to be easily separated after external magnetic field, can be a potential candidate for future water treatment.",
1959,"Contaminated turmeric is a potential source of lead exposure for children in rural Bangladesh BACKGROUND: During the conduct of a cohort study intended to study the associations between mixed metal exposures and child health outcomes, we found that 78% of 309 children aged 20-40 months evaluated in the Munshiganj District of Bangladesh had blood lead concentrations â‰¥5â€‰Âµg/dL and 27% had concentrations â‰¥10â€‰Âµg/dL. HYPOTHESIS: Environmental sources such as spices (e.g., turmeric, which has already faced recalls in Bangladesh due to high lead levels) may be a potential route of lead exposure. METHODS: We conducted visits to the homes of 28 children randomly selected from among high and low blood lead concentration groups. During the visits, we administered a structured questionnaire and obtained soil, dust, rice, and spice samples. We obtained water samples from community water sources, as well as environmental samples from neighborhood businesses. RESULTS: Lead concentrations in many turmeric samples were elevated, with lead concentrations as high as 483â€‰ppm. Analyses showed high bioaccessibility of lead. CONCLUSIONS: Contamination of turmeric powder is a potentially important source of lead exposure in this population.",
1960,"Reforestation-Quality Improvement of Contaminated Mining Soil Most sub-Saharan countries are influenced by either drought or heavy rainfall, as well as poor soil quality and anthropogenic and industrial factors. South Africa is one of the countries in the region where the greatest impact of mining on the environment is observed. These environmental impacts are obvious and need to be addressed during each phase of environmental planning, especially in rural development and improving agriculture sectors. The environmental impacts of mining in South Africa are, in general, increased concentrations of heavy metals and changes of pH in both impacted soils and in water. Mining processes coupled with weather conditions affect the agricultural and forestry sector by impacting water and soil quality. Therefore, there is need to decontaminate mining soils and to improve soil fertility for better agricultural and environmental services. In this regards the addition of different organic fertilizers to improve soil fertility, and as soil ameliorant in contaminated platinum and gold tailings, allowed the indigenous tree species-Searsia lancea to grow despite the high levels of contamination. In a laboratory trial with both types of tailings the combination of different fertilizers and cultivation techniques reduced up to 50% heavy metal contamination and increased similar to 140% microbiological activities. These experiments show a sustainable use of trees combined with fertilizers to decontaminate mine soil while producing a resource (wood) and lowering carbon dioxide, which have impacts on preventing contamination of surrounding areas by Aeolian transport (sandstorms, etc.).",
1961,"PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF DRINKING WATER SOURCES USED FOR LIVESTOCK CONSUMPTION This study seeks to assess the hygienic quality of different drinking water sources commonly used for livestock consumption. It incorporated a questionnaire-based survey as well as a physicochemical and microbiological evaluation of drinking water sources at Kafrelshiekh Governorate, Egypt. The results showed that tap, ground, canal, and mixed water (tap water plus ground water) were the most common water sources used for animal consumption. An assessment of owner's perceptions about the quality of drinking water showed that 95% of the respondents perceived water sources to be safe for their animals, 52.5% perceived that the drinking water would not affect animal health. About 75% of the respondents did not practice water treatment due to financial reasons while 62.5% were indifferent about the water quality. Altogether 160 water samples were collected from the four water sources that were investigated. Groundwater sources exceeded the acceptable livestock water quality guidelines for total dissolved solids, hardness, Na+, Cl-, Mn, and Fe. Mixed water improved water salinity and hardness of the ground water. Microbiological examination showed that canal water sources had the most detrimental total bacterial and E coli counts; E. coli O157 was detected in both the canal and mixed water sources. The results of this study suggest the need to establish a water quality monitoring program for assessing the quality of livestock drinking water sources. It also underscores the need to raise farmers' awareness about the impact of water quality on animal health, water treatment solutions, and frequent water quality monitoring.",
1962,"GROUNDWATER EXPLORATION ON THE MOUNTAIN PLAINS OF DHAMAR AND RADA IN THE YEMEN-ARABIC-REPUBLIC Between 1977 and 1982 a series of short term geophysical surveys for groundwater exploration was conducted within a joint integrated development project. The Dhamar and Rada districts are situated at an elevation between 2000 and 2400 m. The geology of the area is complicated and predominantly volcanic. The main formations are Precambrian metamorphic rocks, Tertiary volcanics, Cretaceous sandstones and Quaternary volcanics. Groundwater occurs in the metamorphic formations mostly in large faults and to a lesser degree in relatively thin alluvial overburden. The Tertiary volcanics consist of alternating layers of more or less permeable lavas, weathered or fractured volcanics and gravel, sand and clay layers. The Quaternary volcanics consist mostly of tuffs (ashes) and basic lavas with a vesicular nature, resulting in a good porosity and permeability. The Tawilah sandstones have a considerable variation in aquifer properties, but form generally an acceptable aquifer. Site location surveys were carried out in a large number of villages using resistivity sounding and at a later stage EM profiling. The main practical problem during surveying was often caused by limitations in space for electrode expansion. A limited number of cases is presented as examples of the results obtained in the various geological formations. In the Precambrian metamorphic formations resistivity sounding was successfully used to locate groundwater in a major faulting system. Yet it must be concluded that EM profiling should be used in advance of resistivity sounding to obtain good results. The surveys in the Tertiary volcanics were also successful, although a good correlation could not always be made between interpretation and borehole logs. The main reason must be found in the generally low formation resistivities of even dry formations, which makes it difficult to indicate water bearing strata. Water bearing formations occur at various depths, presenting an inconsistent groundwater occurrence. A survey near the northwestern edge of the sandstone formations near Rada led to the discovery of a major local aquifer, possibly related to a large fault. The question is raised whether recent volcanic activity may have removed (part of) the sandstones in this area. Resistivity soundings at the foot of the caldera Jebel Isbil indicated groundwater potentials at a depth greater than 200 m. Drilling in this location was successful, while previous boreholes were abandoned as dry, proving that geophysics can improve the rate of success considerably. These results, combined with those obtained near the boundary between the Young Volcanics and the sandstones southeast of the caldera, give good hopes of finding groundwater for villages situated on the Young Volcanics in between. The successful results of the surveys over this period has led to a firm establishment of this activity within the project, where it now plays a permanent and prominent role in groundwater exploration.",
1963,"Sensitivity of soil water retention and availability to biochar addition in rainfed semi-arid farmland during a three-year field experiment Aridity and water stress limit the productivity of rainfed dryland agriculture, and one possible solution to this problem is the application of biochar, a highly porous, pyrolysed biomass material that has been well documented to improve soil quality. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether straw-biochar can be beneficial for improving soil hydraulic properties, explore how biochar affects the temporal and spatial distributions of soil moisture, and ultimately determine whether biochar impacts soil water availability. A 3-year field experiment was conducted on the semi-arid Loess Plateau in northern China, and biochar derived from maize-straw feedstock was applied to a spring maize monoculture cropping system at rates of 0, 10, 20 and 30 t ha(-1). The results of two sampling campaigns of undisturbed soil indicated that the incorporation of biochar reduced the soil bulk density and increased the total pore volume at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm. In addition, a significant negative linear correlation was observed between the rate of biochar addition and the soil bulk density. The incorporation of biochar into the soil not only increased the soil permeability (higher saturated hydraulic conductivity) but also improved the water retention capacity of the mixed soil (higher saturation, readily available and estimated available water contents), particularly when biochar was added at 30 t ha(-1). The soil water contents following rainfall in the biochar-amended plots were consistently greater than the soil water contents in the control (BCO) throughout the entire 5 -day monitoring period, and both irregular precipitation and crop water utilization resulted in temporal and spatial variations in soil water contents throughout the crop growing seasons. Biochar-amended soils were more sensitive to rainfall variations, and the variations in water across the soil profile mainly occurred at depths of 0-40 cm. Compared with the control, the soil permeability was obviously enhanced by the addition of 30 t biochar ha(-1), which resulted in water infiltration at a depth of 0-60 cm. Biochar application increased the crop yields and water use efficiency (WUE). The average yields during the 3 studied years were 10.2% and 14.2% higher in BC20 and BOO, respectively, than in the control, and the average WUEs were 9.4% and 12.3% higher in BC20 and BC30 than in the control, respectively. These results indicate that biochar amendment could improve the physical and hydraulic status of semi-arid agricultural soils, thereby leading to an increase in plant available water.

1964,"Integrated Assessment of no-Regret Climate Change Adaptation Options for Reservoir Catchment and Command Areas The need for credible, salient and legitimate climate change adaptation options in the water sector, which target location specific adaptation requirements, is well recognized. In developing countries, the low-hanging fruit; no-regret options, should be identified with stakeholders and assessed against future changes in water availability and demand, for comparing effectiveness and robustness. Such integrated basin-scale assessments, including reservoir catchment and command areas, can suitably inform adaptation decision-making. In this study, we integrate participatory and modelling approaches for evaluation of reservoir catchment and command area no-regret options addressing water availability and demand in the Kangsabati river basin. Through multi-level stakeholder workshops we identify and prioritize options, followed by evaluation of two reservoir catchment options; check dams and increasing forest cover and three reservoir command options; changing cropping pattern, traditional ponds and waste water reuse, using the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model. We use four high resolution (similar to 25 km) regional climate model simulations of future climatic factors, along with non-climatic factors affecting water demand, for forcing WEAP. We find that options have varied ability in addressing adaptation requirements. Amongst catchment options, increasing forest cover addresses adaptation requirements more suitably than check dams, while in the command areas we observe mixed abilities of options, leading to the inference that combining complementary options may be a more useful strategy. We conclude by discussing our experiences with this approach in a developing country context, in terms of benefits, limitations, lessons learnt and future research directions.",
1965,"Safety of Drinking Water from Primary Water Sources and Implications for the General Public in Uganda BACKGROUND: There is scarcity of information about the quality and safety of drinking water in Africa. Without such vital information, sustainable development goal number 6 which promotes availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation remains elusive especially in developing countries. The study aimed at determining concentrations of inorganic compounds, estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI), incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), and identify safe drinking water source sources in Southwestern Uganda. METHODS: This was an observational study in which 40 drinking water samples were collected from georeferenced boreholes, springs, open wells, bottled, and taps within Bushenyi district of Southwestern Uganda. Water samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) levels using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Water safety measures (EDI, HI, and ILCR) were established for each water source and compared with local and international water permissible standards for each analyte. A spatial map was drawn using qGISÂ®, and analysis of quantitative data was done using MS Excel 2013 at 95% significance. RESULTS: Heavy metals were present in the following order: 11.276â€‰ppmâ€‰>â€‰4.4623â€‰ppm >â€‰0.81â€‰ppmâ€‰>â€‰0.612â€‰ppm >â€‰0.161â€‰ppm for Fe, Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd, respectively, while Cr was not detected. Fe was the primary water heavy metal in the order of open wellâ€‰>â€‰boreholeâ€‰>â€‰tapâ€‰>â€‰springâ€‰>â€‰bottled water. This was followed by Zn levels in the order of tapâ€‰>â€‰bottledâ€‰>â€‰springâ€‰>â€‰boreholeâ€‰>â€‰open well. All compounds were within international water safety standards except Pb. Hence, there is need for the government of Uganda to establish water filtration systems, particularly for Pb to improve the quality of water for the general public. The EDI was similar (P > 0.05) for water consumed from spring, bottled, and tap sources for Fe and Zn levels. Similarly, no differences were found in the EDI for children and adults (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the HI showed an absence of noncarcinogenic risk associated (HIâ€‰<â€‰1), although the ILCR was higher in adults than children (P < 0.05) due to high Cd concentrations. CONCLUSION: The current identified Fe is a major heavy metal in drinking water of Uganda, and boreholes were the major safest sources of drinking water identified in this study.",
1966,"Assessing environmental exposure and health impacts of gold mining in Ghana Understanding the extent to which people are being exposed to environmental contaminants helps to identify those populations which may be disproportionately exposed to the contaminants of potential public health concern. This study represents the first report of a comparison of heavy metal arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), platinum (Pt), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) concentrations in the blood of residents of mining and non-mining communities in Ghana. Blood sampling, health records, and interviews were used in this study to establish the links between the levels of contaminants and health effects in humans within a mining and non-mining community in Ghana. Results of this study show that mean concentration of As in blood in Tarkwa Nsuaem Municipality/Prestea-Huni Valley District (TNMA/PHVD) (mining communities) and Cape Coast Metropolis (CCMA) (non-mining community) was 18- and 2-fold higher, respectively, than the WHO guideline value of 0.002 mg L-1. The mean concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Hg, and Mn were elevated up to 20-fold higher in the blood of resident adults and children in TNMA/PHVD than in CCMA. The risk of acute respiratory infections in the exposed populations of TNMA and PHVD were approximately 41- and 12-fold greater than the unexposed group. The risk of diabetes mellitus in the exposed populations of TNMA and PHVD were also approximately 20- and 4-fold higher than the unexposed group. In TNMA and PHVD, 40 blood donors were suffering from hyperkeratosis or pigmentation unlike their CCMA counterparts. Data suggest a potential association between mining activities and the levels of these heavy metals. However, the proportion of anthropogenic contribution to the levels of these metals in the blood remains uncertain. This uncertainty seems to be the umbrella under which both government and mining companies continue to hide, leading to inaction.",
1967,"Multiple dynamic Al-based floc layers on ultrafiltration membrane surfaces for humic acid and reservoir water fouling reduction The integration of adsorbents with ultrafiltration (UF) membranes is a promising method for alleviating membrane fouling and reducing land use. However, adsorbents typically are only injected into the membrane tank once, resulting in a single dynamic protection layer and low removal efficiency over long-term operation. In addition, the granular adsorbents used can cause membrane surface damage. To overcome these disadvantages, we injected inexpensive and loose aluminum (Al)-based flocs directly into a membrane tank with bottom aeration in the presence of humic acid (HA) or raw water taken from the Miyun Reservoir (Beijing, China). Results showed that the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank, and multiple dynamic floc protection layers were formed (sandwich-like) on the membrane surface with multiple batch injections. Higher frequency floc injections resulted in better floc utilization efficiency and less severe membrane fouling. With continuous injection, acid solutions demonstrated better performance in removing HA molecules, especially those with small molecular weight, and in alleviating membrane fouling compared with the use of high aeration rate or polyacrylamide injection. This was attributed to the small particle size, large specific surface area, and high zeta potential of the flocs. Additionally, excellent UF membrane performance was exhibited by reservoir water with continuous injection and acid solution. Based on the outstanding UF membrane performance, this innovative integrated filtration with loose Al-based flocs has great application potential for water treatment.",

1969,"Distribution and origin of potentially toxic elements in a multi-aquifer system Pollution of the potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is a major concern in the metal ore-mining environment. Active polymetallic industries and mines cause great continuous devastation of both terrestrial and aquatic environments on a local and regional scale. This study investigated the pollution of surface water and groundwater in the area containing six large-scale iron ore mines, which have been in operation for more than a few decades. In order to assess the PTEs pollution, the spatial and temporal distributions of 13 different PTEs (Al, As, Co, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Si, Sr, and Zn) were measured in 42 water samples collected from the multi-aquifer system including three distinct aquifers (upper alluvial aquifer (UAA), lower alluvial aquifer (LAA), and hard-rock aquifer (HRA)) of the Gohar-Zamin mining area in Iran. The highest concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS = 164,000 mg/l) and PTEs were measured in HRA. Three trends were identified between the PTE concentration and increasing of TDS based on Spearman correlation analysis: (1) an increasing trend for Al, Co, Li, Mn, Rb, Se, Sr, and Ni; there were strong positive correlations in HRA between TDS and Mn (0.83), Al (0.65), Co (0.74), Li (0.90), Ni (0.83), Rb (0.91), Se (0.82), and Sr (0.84), suggesting a common origin for these elements; (2) no obvious trend for As and Mo, no correlation was founded between As and Mo with other PTEs and TDS, indicating a natural geogenic origin and mutual dependencies of these elements; and (3) a decreasing trend for Si, Zn, and Pb; TDS had a significantly negative correlation with the PTEs and attributing to different chemical properties of infiltrated groundwater. In the principal component analysis (PCA), the first PC that covers 85.09% of the total observed variance is mainly attributed the groundwater salinization. This component is composed of Al, Co, Li, Mn, Rb, Se, Sr, and Ni. The second PC contains elements As and Mo. This PC explain 14.4% of total variance and may be referred to natural origin of PTEs. Si, Zn, and Pb are in the third principal component and cover 9.64% of the variance of the data. Third PC have been attributed to lithogenic and/or primary water chemistry factors. The PTE pollution were evaluated based on heavy metal evaluation index (HEI), heavy metal pollution index (HPI), and degree of contamination (C-d). The results indicated that all of the groundwater samples collected from HRA had HEI, HPI, andC(d)values greater than 21, 264, and 14 (highly pollution limits of indices), respectively, and were classified as highly polluted groundwater. HPI values within the UAA, LAA, and salt playa (SP) were lower than the critical level of 100, suggesting a threshold for the drinking water pollution. Moreover, HEI andC(d)with values of less than 10 and 7 suggested low-level pollution in UAA, LAA, and SP. However, the contaminated level of PTEs exceeded the WHO standard for drinking water in HRA only. Since groundwater in HRA is a brine with the high values of PTEs, pumping of this water out to the surrounding natural environment may cause harmful impacts on the environment and perhaps living species in Bahram-e-Goor protected area.

1970,The Efficiency of geothermal heat pumps with vertical ground heat exchangers: A simulation under Iraqi conditions Geothermal heat pumps with ground source heat exchangers have been widely used for heating and cooling homes as well as for domestic water heating. A study on a small house in Erbil-Iraq was conducted to assess energy savings when using GHPs with closed loop ground source heat exchangers as compared with air-to-air heat pumps. Local climate conditions and soil properties of Erbil located in the north of Iraq were used. The simulation was performed using TRNSYS-16 software. The results of this study show that we can reduce the energy used for heating and cooling by 39% during annual when using GHP. The simulation also showed that the average COP for heating is 2.9 and for cooling is 2.6 when using air to air heat pumps and the average COP for heating is 5.6 and 3.6 for cooling when using GHP. This reduction in energy reduces the CO(2) emission as it reduces energy consumption.,
1971,"Effects of inherent potassium on the catalytic performance of Ni/biochar for steam reforming of toluene as a tar model compound Biochar supported nickel (Ni/BC) has been widely studied as a cheap and easy-to-prepare catalyst with potential applications in tar reforming during the gasification of low-rank fuels, such as brown coal and biomass. However, the role and behaviors of inherent K species, especially their interactions with Ni particles and the biochar support, are not well understood yet. In this work, three Ni/BC catalysts with varying K amount were prepared from raw, water-washed, and acid-washed biomass. They were used in steam reforming of toluene as a tar model compound to elucidate the effects of inherent K on the catalytic activity and stability. Detailed characterization indicated that K enhanced water adsorption due to its hydroscopicity and lowered the condensation and graphitization degrees of biochar, but the alteration to the electronic state of Ni was not observed. These effects together led to a temperature-dependent role of K. That is, at relatively low temperatures of 450 and 500 degrees C, toluene conversion was increased in the presence of K, due to the increased concentration of adsorbed water around Ni particles. By contrast, at relatively higher temperatures of 550 and 600 degrees C, although initial high activity was achieved, Ni/BC with K deactivated rapidly because of the accelerated consumption of the biochar support.

1972,"Requirements to technological water quality for tea drinks preparation Introduction. The purpose of research - to develop evidence-based requirements to technological water for tea drinks prepare. Materials and methods. Large leaf black and green tea production of Sri Lanka. Model solutions. Determined of the total content of polyphenolic substances in tea drinks was measured with the method of Folin-Chokalteo. Determination of other indexes was determined with standard methods. Results and discussion. With concentration of total hardness equal to 7 mmol/dm(3) occurred a decrease of polyphenolic substances content on 179 mg/dm(3) (from 439 to 260 mg/dm(3)) in a black tea drink, and on 184 mg/dm(3) (from 816 to 632 mg/dm(3)) polyphenol substances in the green tea drink. Presence of salt of hardness in the water adversely affected the color, taste and aroma of the tea drinks. Best taste has tea drink prepared on water with a value of TDS at 200 mg/dm(3). The value of indicator of permanganate oxidation more than 1 mgO(2)/dm(3), the organoleptic characteristics of the tea drinks, especially taste, are deteriorates. At a concentration of residual free chlorine at 0,2 mg/dm(3) the taste lost expressive sequences, and smell of tea, especially green, became a barely perceptible. When residual free chlorine concentration is over 0,4 mg/dm(3) for green tea drink and over 0,5 mg/dm(3) for black tea drink it is begin to feel the smell of chlorine, causing a desire to abandon the consumption of drinks. The content of residual free chlorine in the water cause a reduction of content of polyphenolic substances, vitamin C and caffeine in drinks. If the concentration of residual free chlorine is 0,5 mg/dm(3), the content of polyphenolic substances are reduced 11 % in black tea drinks, and 8,5 % in green tea drinks. For preparation of tea drinks with good organoleptic properties and minimal loss of nutrients we recomed to use water with content of free residual chlorine of 0,1 mg/dm(3), copper - 1 mg/dm(3), total iron - 0,2 mg/dm(3), hardness - 2 mmol/dm(3), permanganate oxidation value - 2 mgO(2)/dm(3), TDS - 100-250 mg/dm(3). Preparation of a tea drinks with further purified tap water which conforms to requirements allow to reduce the loss of polyphenolic substances in 1,5 times, vitamin C in 2,5 times, caffeine in 10% and significantly improved organoleptic characteristics in comparison with the drinks prepared on tap water without further purification. Conclusions. It is recommended for establishments of restaurant industry orientate on formulated requirements to water for tea drinks.",
1973,"Phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance patterns of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella isolated from dairy farm milk, farm slurry and water in Punjab, India Antibiotic resistance is a mushrooming pandemic at national and international levels which if not controlled at this very moment, can lead to global problems. Main reason for emerging bacterial resistance is repeated exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial agents and access of bacteria to increasingly large pools of antimicrobial resistance genes in mixed bacterial populations. A total of 51 villages were sampled in the current study contributing to a total of 153 farms. A total of 612 samples comprising 153 each of raw pooled milk samples, slurry, animal drinking water and human drinking water were gathered from small, medium and large farms located in all seven tehsils of Ludhiana district of Punjab. In addition to that, 37 samples of village pond water were also collected from the targeted villages. Out of total 153 slurry, raw pooled milk samples, animal drinking water and human drinking water samples (each), the prevalence of 24.8%, 60%, 26.7% and 16.3% was found for E. coli respectively. On the other hand, for Klebsiella, the overall prevalence of 19.6%, 51%, 20.2% and 5.8% was found from slurry, raw pooled milk samples, animal drinking water and human drinking water respectively. In all matrices, the comparative frequency of resistance genes in positive isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae was: tetA > tetB > tetC, qnrS > qnrB > qnrA, sulII > sulI > sulIII. The highest proportion of resistance genes was found in slurry (193 genes) followed by milk (71 genes). The overall pattern of resistant genes was tetA > sulII > qnrS. In conclusion, data from the present study suggested that commensal E. coli and Klebsiella may act as reservoirs of antimicrobial drug resistance genes which may be mobilised into human populations and untreated animal waste may be considered an important source of resistant bacteria leading to environmental pollution.",
1974,"A full-scale analysis of chemical characteristics of PM2.5 and PM10 during haze and non-haze episodes in Cixi city, China With the objectives to understand the chemical characteristics of particulate matters in haze episodes, PM2.5 and PM10, samples were simultaneously collected for six days in each season from August 2013 to March 2014 in Cixi, China. The daily average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, in Cixi were 117 and 151 mu g/m(3), respectively, which were higher than those in metropolises of China. The long-range air mass transport from northern China largely affected the particle levels in haze days in Cixi, while the air mass transport from the Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea diluted local pollutants in non-haze days. High enrichment factors of Cu, Sn, Zn, Pb and Se, ranging from 100 to 10,000, were found in PM2.5, revealing their predominant anthropogenic sources in Cixi, for instance industry emissions and vehicle exhaust. Similar emission sources of water-soluble inorganic ions at urban and suburban were observed, which indicated that the variations of their levels in haze and non-haze days were more regionally related than to locally. The NO3-/SO42- ratios, from 1.27 to 1.88 in haze days and lower than those in non-haze days, revealed that industry emissions might be more important than vehicle exhaust for the haze pollution. Compared with those in non-haze days, the mean concentrations of elements, water-soluble inorganic ions and carbonaceous species in PM2.5 and PM10, as well as PM2.5/PM2.5-10 mass ratios significantly increased in haze days, which indicated that haze was greatly beneficial to the accumulation of air pollutants, especially in fine particles.",
1975,"Mehedinti Mountains: Cioaca cu Brebenei and Closani Caves Since both caves developed in similar geological and hydrogeological conditions, they are presented in this chapter side by side. Although very different in size, both caves are well-known for their wide diversity of speleothems. Cioaca cu Brebenei is an 85 m long cavity that hosts some of the largest and most spectacular helictites of the Romanian karst. The cave has been carved by the Izvorele Creek, a right-side tributary of the Motru River. Closani Cave is one of Romania's most thoroughly studied caves that hosts the only underground laboratory devoted to a variety of ""in situ"" cave studies. The cave has two major galleries (Laboratories and Crystals) summing up 1458 m of passages. Abundant and diverse speleothems, including shields, draperies, eccentrics, helictites, and gorgeous calcite pool spar crystals, are decorating the Crystals Passage. Closani appears to be a base-level cave, genetically connected with the flow of the Izvorele Creek and at a later stage of the Motru River. U-series analyses of speleothems indicate the cave is older than 600,000 years. Both caves are speleological reservations (Protection class A) located within the Domogled-Valea Cernei National Park and the ROSCI-0035 (Romanian Sites of Community Importance) ""Natura 2000"" Site.",
1976,"Combined hydrogeological and nitrate modelling to manage water resources of the Middle Soummam Aquifer, Northeast of Algeria Water management is one of the most challenges in Algeria, a semi-arid Mediterranean country confronted to a serious water stress. The country will have to endure, beyond 2025, a situation of chronic water penury, adding an excessive pollution of the majority of groundwater reservoirs. The management of water resources by combined approach using hydrogeological model and nitrates evolution model was experimented in the Middle Soummam valley. The alluvial aquifer, offering good hydrodynamic and geometrical characteristics, is over-exploited, providing in drinking water Akbou and Tazmalt cities and irrigation perimeters. If exploitation continues at these steady paces, the depletion of the water resource and the hydrochemical imbalance will be inevitable. On the one hand, the results of hydrodynamic model, based on an increase of the water takings and simulated needs from 24.71 Mm(3)/year in 2015 into 39.69 Mm(3)/year in 2030, show a critical withdrawal. The aquifer budget expresses the inversion of flow between the wadi and the aquifer where the wadi feeds the groundwater reservoir. This hydrodynamic inversion was attributed to simulated pumping rates which increased and exceeded 100,000 m(3)/day, but the aquifer was partially relieved by the weight of the exploitation through Tichy Haf dam. The water management strategy adopted in this study was based on management measures promoting zones, which have been delimited between Tazmalt and Akbou, and containing important water quantities available in the axis of the valley. However, according to the depleted in isotopes of O-18 and H-2, which could be explained by the influence of a paleo-climatic effect and suggested that the aquifer recharge would have largely been made under a colder climate, pumped groundwater could be old, and the implementation of new pumping sites has been studied minutely. On the other hand, the hydrogeochemical modelling allowed following nitrates concentrations in order to project their evolution. Four wells on 25 react in face to the imposed conditions in each scenario simulated until 2030, showing inertia of pollution, and confirmed after three series of tests. This inertia would be related to the hydraulic gradients and hydraulic conductivities, aquifer thickness and recharge. The low hydraulic gradients lead to a rather slow flow velocity and thus to an inertia in the dispersion of nitrates, with a mass transport weakened by the hydrodynamic conditions. It is also related to the aquifer thickness; when the aquifer is powerful (65-85 m), the stock of water would be important and allows a dilution process. The reverse is true for the simulated boreholes where the concentrations remain invariant; the aquifer is less powerful (32-37 m). Finally, the recharge effect through the rain was evoked; the aquifer is unconfined, and the rain water and pollution that reached the piezometric level can remain in position in slow hydrodynamic conditions. The methodology was demonstrated through a combination of monitoring and modelling for both water quantity and quality and the importance to use numerical models to support water resources management strategy in the Mediterranean aquifers.",
1977,"Hydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater in Iwo, Ikonifin and Ife-Odan, Osun and Oyo states, Southwest Nigeria Hydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater in some communities (Iwo, Ikonifin and Ife-odan) of Southwest Nigeria was carried out. The physicochemical parameters determined include pH, temperature, redox potential (Eh), electrical conductivity and depth of wells. The concentration of heavy metals was determined using Bulk Scientific model of atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Flame photometer was used to determine Na and K, while titration method was used to determine Mg and Ca. The obtained results indicate that the majority of the sampled wells were deep (> 16 m) and the values of redox potentials (EH) recorded were mainly positive with the exception of a few. Most parameters were within the WHO-recommended limits in drinking water. DO was significantly higher at Ife-Odan with values of 4.96 +/- A 0.34 mgL(-1), while wells from Ikonifin were significantly deeper than others. The PO4 (3-) and SO4 (2-)concentrations were significantly high, both in Ife-Odan and Iwo, which was attributed to possible runoff from diffuse sources (wastes). The piper diagram showed that the dominant cations were Na+ and K+, while the dominant anions were CO3 (2-) and HCO3 (2-), suggesting that the major ions are from water-rock interactions. The concentration of lead (Pb) was found to be higher than the recommended WHO limit of 0.05 mgL(-1) in drinking water from most (80 %) of the samples. Significantly (P < 0.05) high Pb concentration values were recorded from Ife-Odan (0.53 +/- A 0.04 mgL(-1)) and Ikonifin (0.6 +/- A 0.06 mgL(-1)). The cadmium (Cd) concentration was found to be slightly higher than 0.003 mgL(-1), theWHO-recommended limit for all locations.",
1978,"Fluoride in Drinking Water and Skeletal Fluorosis: a Review of the Global Impact When safe and adequate exposure of an essential trace element is exceeded it becomes potentially toxic. Fluoride is one classic example of such a double edged sword which both plays a fundamental role in the normal growth and development of the body for example the consumption of levels between 0.5-1.0 ppm via drinking water is beneficial for prevention of dental caries but its excessive consumption leads to development of fluorosis.Purpose of ReviewThe abundance of fluorine in the environment as well as in drinking water sources are the major contributors to fluorosis. It is a serious public health concern as it is a noteworthy medical problem in 24 nations including India yet the threat of fluorosis has not been rooted out. The review focuses on recent findings related to skeletal fluorosis and role of oxidative stress in its development. The fluoride mitigation strategies adopted in recent years are also discussed.Recent Findings Based on Case StudiesRecent findings revealed that consumption of fluoride at concentrations of 1.5 ppm is majorly responsible for skeletal fluorosis. The sampling from rural areas showed that 80% villages are having fluoride concentrations more than the WHO permissible limits and people residing in such areas are affected by the skeletal fluorosis and also in the regions of Africa and Asia endemic fluorosis have been accounted in the majority of the region affecting approximately 100 million people. Various mitigation programmes and strategies have been conducted all over the world using defluoridation.SummaryFluorosis is a slow and progressive malady affecting our body and a serious concern to be taken into consideration and to be dealt with effectively. The fluoride toxicity although reversible, is a slow process and the side effects lack treatment options. The treatment options available are either not approachable or affordable in the rural areas commonly suffering from the fluoride toxicity. No specific treatments are available to date to treat skeletal fluorosis affectively; therefore, prevention is one of most safest and best approach to fight fluorosis. The current review lays emphasis on the skeletal fluorosis and its prevalence in recent years. It also includes the recent findings as well as the current strategies related to combat skeletal fluorosis and provides findings that might be helpful to promote the research in the field of effective treatment for fluorosis as well as development of easy and affordable methods of fluoride removal from water.",
1979,"Next-generation sequencing showing potential leachate influence on bacterial communities around a landfill in China The impact of contaminated leachate on groundwater from landfills is well known, but the specific effects on bacterial consortia are less well-studied. Bacterial communities in a landfill and an urban site located in Suzhou, China, were studied using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. A total of 153â€‰944 good-quality reads were produced and sequences assigned to 6388 operational taxonomic units. Bacterial consortia consisted of up to 16 phyla, including Proteobacteria (31.9%-94.9% at landfill, 25.1%-43.3% at urban sites), Actinobacteria (0%-28.7% at landfill, 9.9%-34.3% at urban sites), Bacteroidetes (1.4%-25.6% at landfill, 5.6%-7.8% at urban sites), Chloroflexi (0.4%-26.5% at urban sites only), and unclassified bacteria. Pseudomonas was the dominant (67%-93%) genus in landfill leachate. Arsenic concentrations in landfill raw leachate (RL) (1.11 Ã— 10(3) Î¼g/L) and fresh leachate (FL2) (1.78 Ã— 10(3) Î¼g/L) and mercury concentrations in RL (10.9 Î¼g/L) and FL2 (7.37 Î¼g/L) exceeded Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration standards for leachate in landfills. The Shannon diversity index and Chao1 richness estimate showed RL and FL2 lacked richness and diversity when compared with other samples. This is consistent with stresses imposed by elevated arsenic and mercury and has implications for ecological site remediation by bioremediation or natural attenuation.",
1980,"Case study: Erosion of an axial flow regulating valve in a solid-gas pipe flow In some gas fields in southern China, axial flow regulating valves are often exposed to extreme conditions, where high speed flow (greater than 20m/s) and particle erosion (particle concentration of 1 mg/s-100 mg/s) lead to inner leakage and flow suppression. Surface erosion behavior is investigated through on-line particle monitoring experiments and 3D imaging wear measurements, and various flow control approaches are proposed to study the erosion characteristics of axial flow regulating valves. Numerical studies of Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange methods are introduced to provide a theoretical insight into the erosion caused by fine particles in the compressible flow. The erosion behavior characteristics are identified and further studied by applying a relatively large-scaled moving grid method. The results indicate that depending on the valve opening, the severely eroded area will shift from the edge of the extrusion to the center of the extrusion part. The Euler-Euler method combined with the Oka erosion model can provide a satisfactory result in a compressible gas flow laden with particles. The erosion rate presents a decreasing trend with increasing operation pressure due to the gas compressibility. The erosion rate, impact velocity, and impact angle present a decreasing trend with decreasing wall thickness of the valve core when the surface evolution is considered. The conventional transient calculation could only provide a satisfactory result in a limited time span, while calculations with a moving grid method show the erosion behavior of the total failure process along the valve's life span.",
1981,"Suburban Areas in Developing Countries and Their Relationship to Groundwater Pollution: A Case Study of Mar del Plata, Argentina / Human activities carried out in suburban areas in many developing countries are directly related to groundwater pollution. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the relationship between land use and groundwater pollution in the suburban area of Mar del Plata (Argentina). We identified three elements that are endangering the quality of groundwater: horticultural activity, urban solid waste disposal sites, and sewage disposal on land. Fifty wells in an area of 175 km2 were sampled in order to verify the impact of these problems on groundwater. All samples were analyzed for major ions, and about 30 of them for fecal coliforms and heavy metals. Nineteen samples were selected for pesticide analyses. The average nitrate content was 80 mg/liter, eight times the regional background value. Fecal coliforms were detected in 60% of the analyzed samples. Zinc content and a high Cl-/HCO3- ratio were observed in the surroundings of the solid waste disposal area. Moreover, lindane and heptachlor pesticides were detected in ten samples.KEY WORDS: Suburban areas; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater management; Argentina",
1982,"Distribution of trace metal in Shaune Garang catchment: evidence from particles and nanoparticles The input of colloids and nanoparticles reactive elements might even cause catastrophic melting events of polar ice caps and glaciers. Although enhancing contribution of glacial melt water into the oceans might be responsible about the element concentrations and distribution in glacial melt water fed river systems. Distribution and environmental assessment of heavy metals in the melt water draining from the glacier system during 2016 has been studied. In order to evaluate the physical and chemical distribution such as salinity, dissolved oxygen and particulate matters (Mn, Al, Si and Zn) in the form of nanoparticles, water samples were filtered by using 0.2 mu m filter paper. The sampling locations were six from the snout to the downstream of Shaune Garang water channel. The conductivity of melt water is found to be same for all sampling locations while pH showed a minor variation. Variation in pH and conductivity indicates that elemental concentration of the study area is predisposed by meteorological factors and duration of rock-water contact. The leading mechanism responsible for the high concentration of nutrient is expected due to the metal dissolution from the particulate phase in the glacial river system. Mn particles observed in the catchment ranged from 0.86 to 2.43 mg/l with an average value 1.53 +/- 0.48 mg/l. This could be due to the long resident time of flowing water on the rock surface. Basically, heavy metals distribution in the glacial system is controlled by different mechanism such as weathering of rocks, nature of rock, transportation by glacier as well as melt water and deposition. The findings reported here can have important implications for understanding the localized glacio-hydrological variations within the Himalayan ranges. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
1983,"Studies on the antimutagenic activity of ascorbic acid in vitro and in vivo The possibility that ascorbic acid, as a nucleophile, may inhibit mutagenicity induced by electrophilic metabolites of N-nitroso compounds was examined. In vitro data are presented to show that ascorbic acid does not decrease the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in a modified Ames bacterial mutagenicity system if deionized water is used to prepare the incubation medium. However, ascorbic acid prevents the mutagenicity of MNNG in vitro if added to bacteria in a medium prepared with either sterile tap water or deionized water and Cu2+ ions and that this antimutagenic response is blocked by EDTA. Additional in vitro experiments suggest that when ascorbic acid and Cu2+ ions are mixed in aqueous solution, H2O2 and free radicals derived from H2O2 are formed and these compounds may deactivate N-nitroso compounds. In vivo data are presented to show that ascorbic acid supplementation to guinea pigs (2000 mg/kg body weight/day) has no effect on the mutagenicity of N-nitrosodimethylamine, MNNG, N-methylnitrosourea and streptozotocin using the intrahepatic host-mediated bacterial mutagenicity assay. Additional in vivo studies demonstrate that simultaneous oral administration of ascorbic acid prevents the mutagenicity that follows the intragastric nitrosation of aminopyrine by nitrite while dietary pre-treatment with ascorbic acid does not. These findings suggest that ascorbic acid can block the intragastric formation of mutagenic N-nitroso compounds but that ascorbic acid has no effect on mutagenicity of N-nitroso compounds once they are formed.",
1984,"Happiness on Tap: Piped Water Adoption in Urban Morocco Connecting private dwellings to the water main is expensive and typically cannot be publicly financed. We show that households' willingness to pay for a private connection is high when it can be purchased on credit, not because a connection improves health but because it increases the time available for leisure and reduces inter- and intra-household conflicts on water matters, leading to sustained improvements in well-being. Our results suggest that facilitating access to credit for households to finance lump sum quality-of-life investments can significantly increase welfare, even if those investments do not result in any health or income gains.

Detailed examination of reports from the print media of Singapore, Malaysia and international sources constitutes the basis for a discussion of the roles the media have played between the two countries. The analysis shows how the media slowly evolved from being mainly a reporter to becoming an active platform for communication between the interested parties, acting both officially and unofficially, as well as directly and subtly, leading to shaping public opinion in either of the two countries, particularly regarding their water relationship.",
1986,"The affective affordances of frugal science using foldscopes during a life sciences water quality practical Manu Prakash, the developer of the foldscope microscope reported on in this paper, stated that it is important to use tools that can support open-ended inquiry in the classroom, without dumbing down those tools. Scientific equipment in the school laboratory is often very expensive and only available to those who can afford it. â€œFrugal scienceâ€ is a trend in education that researches, develops and introduces economical and quality scientific resources to developing countries. In South Africa, many underprivileged schools lack quality practical and laboratory resources to perform simple tasks, such as microscopy. Furthermore, the absence of laboratory investigations could lead to learners not enjoying Life Sciences nor developing a more nuanced understanding of the nature (tenets) of science. As part of an indigenous knowledge intervention hosted by the North-West University, teachers were provided with $1 foldscopes (paper microscope) to use in their classrooms. This research reports on the views of Life Sciences learners and teachers on the use of foldscopes in the Life Sciences classroom during a practical lesson. The focus of the research is to illuminate how such problem-based approaches could enhance affective outcomes. This generic qualitative research study has elements of design-based research (DBR) as well as classroom action research (CAR), carried out by participating teachers to investigate the affordances of foldscopes. Data was collected using observations, teacher reflections, learner reflections, photographs and personal interviews. From an affective stance, this qualitative study used EngestrÃ¶m's third-generation Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a research lens in order to identify factors that promote or inhibit the use of foldscopes in the Life Sciences classroom during a practical lesson.

1987,"Electrolysis of water Hydrogen energy systems, based on renewable energy (RE) sources, are being proposed as a means to increase energy independence, improve domestic economies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from stationary and mobile fossil-fueled sources. In 2003, the United States consumed roughly 84.3 billion m3 (7.6 billion kilograms) of hydrogen, the majority of which was produced via the widely established thermal process known as steam methane reforming (SMR). The electrolytic production of hydrogen, while not economically competitive today with SMR, is positioned to become the preferred method due to the inevitable price increase of natural gas and as environmental, social, and economic factors are weighed. SMR constitutes roughly 50% of the 450-500 billion m3 yr-1 (38-42 billion kg yr-1) of global production of the gas. SMR, like hydrogen production from all fossil fuels, suffers from supply issues and climate-altering carbon-based pollution. The reforming process generates CO 2 as well as carbon monoxide (CO), which is poisonous to humans because the oxygen-transporting hemoglobin has 200 times the affinity to CO than O Electrolysis currently supplies roughly 4% of the world's hydrogen. If hydrogen is to be used as a transportation fuel, the United State could conceivably replace the 140 billion gallons per year (gal yr-1) of gasoline consumed in 2004 with domestically produced hydrogen. The energy equivalent of this much gasoline is 17.3 Ã— 1015 BTU, assuming approximately 5.2 million BTU bbl-1 of motor gasoline.4 The environmental gains hoped for by the transition to a hydrogen economy can only be achieved when renewable sources are ramped up to produce an increasing amount of the hydrogen gas. From the early 1800s to the mid 1900s town gas was comprised of roughly 50% hydrogen that brought light and heat to much of America and Europe and can still be found in some parts of Europe, China and Asia. Due to hydrogen's thermal conductivity and low density the gas is being used to cool many large thermal electrical power generators. Hydrogen is used in a wide variety of applications: â€¢ Chemicals-Ammonia and fertilizer manufacture-Synthesis of methanol-Sorbitol production-General pharmaceuticals and vitamins â€¢ Electronics-Polysilicon production-Epitaxial deposition-Fiber optics â€¢ Metals-Annealing/heat treating-Powder metallurgy â€¢ Fuels-Petroleum refinement-Liquid rocket fuel-Some use in fuel cells â€¢ Food and float glass-Fats/fatty acids-Blanketing Renewable sources of electricity and off-peak hydroelectric can be used to produce a sustainable supply of hydrogen for transportation, peak-shaving applications and in some special cases to smooth the variability in the renewable source. Powering millions of hydrogen internal combustion engines and/or fuel cell vehicles with hydrogen generated with traditional fossil fuel sources (without carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage or geological sequestration) is merely transferring the pollution from the tailpipe to the stack pipe. In the case of SMR, liquid natural gas imports would increase to replace today's 12.9 million bbl day-1 of oil imports here in the U.S.4. As developing countries fall in love with motorized transportation, much like the developed countries already have, transportation's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions will grow from the 25% it holds today. Still today, the electrolytic production of hydrogen using renewable sources is the only way to produce large quantities of hydrogen without emitting the traditional byproducts associated with fossil-fuels. The electrolysis of water is an electrochemical reaction requiring no moving parts and a direct electric current, making it one of the simplest ways to produce hydrogen. The electrochemical decomposition of water into its two constituent parts has been shown to be reliable, clean and with the removal of water vapor from the product capable of producing ultra-pure hydrogen (&gt; 99.999%). The primary disadvantage of electrolysis is the requirement of high-quality of electrical energy needed to disa sociate the gas. Electricity is a convenient energy carrier as it can be transported to loads relatively easily. However, locating and constructing new transmission and distribution power lines is challenging and expensive. The cost of transporting electricity along power lines can constitute greater than 50% of the total cost at the point of end-use. Historically, hydrogen production via electrolysis has only been viable where large amounts of inexpensive electricity have been available or the high purity product gas was necessary in a downstream process. The potential environmental benefit of a hydrogen-based economy is hinged to a large degree on the ability to generate the gas from renewable resources in a costeffective manner. An apparently ideal solution is to use wind-generated electricity to electrolyze water. Today, hydrogen production via electrolysis only meets the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) goals of $2-$3 per kilogram (kg) in large installations where electrolyzer capital costs are low, less than $800 per kilowatt (kW), and those having access to inexpensive electricity, less than $0.04 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Electricity from large-scale wind farms in Class 4 or better resource can be generated in the range of $0.05-$0.08 kWh-1, not including today's $0.019 kWh-1 Federal production tax credit. The out-of-pocket cost of fossil-fuels, whether for electricity production or as transportation fuels, has remained relatively low; limiting the expansion of renewable forms of energy. For example, if the external costs of production were taken into account the cost of coal-generated electricity would rise an additional $0.03-$0.06 kWh-1. Further limiting market penetration of renewable sources is that fossil fuels continue to receive the bulk of tax incentives here in the U.S. The term renewable defines these technologies as driven by natural and sustainable processes which are inherently variable, not intermittent. Natural processes vary over time but are not subject to the on-off switching that, for example, a light bulb connected to a switch is subjected to. Advocates may want to begin training themselves to describe RE as variable, not intermittent, to better describe their naturally occurring behavior. RE sources of energy can provide cost-effective, emission-free electricity with zero-or low-carbon impact making it one of the preferred methods for supplying energy to society. The large-scale wind energy facilities being installed throughout the world are a testament to the growing demand, environmentally preferred and cost-effectiveness of this RE technology.",
1988,"A comparison of chemical MSW compositional data between China and Denmark Chemical waste compositions are important for municipal solid waste management, as they determine the pollution potentials from different waste strategies. A representative dataset for chemical characteristics of individual waste fractions is frequently required to assess chemical waste composition, but it is usually reported in developed countries and not in developing countries. In this study, a dataset for Chinese waste was established through careful data screening and assessment, named as CN dataset. Meanwhile, a dataset for Danish waste (DK dataset) was also summarized based on previous studies. In order to quantitatively evaluate the reliabilities of CN and DK datasets, the chemical waste compositions in four Chinese cities were estimated by utilizing both of them, respectively. It is indicated that the usage of CN datasets led to significantly lower discrepancies from the actual values based on laboratory analysis in most cases. Within the datasets, the moisture contents of food waste, paper, textiles, and plastics, the carbon content of food waste, as well as the oxygen content of plastics would induce significant divergences, which should be paid special attention when gathering the information. In addition, the fractional waste compositions in China showed similar features with other developing countries but differ significantly with developed countries. Thus the above-mentioned conclusions could also be true in other developing countries. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

1989,"ZnTe/ZnSe heterostructures: In-situ synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activity for Congo Red degradation Recently, there is growing concern over environmental pollution rising specifically from the water contamination due to industrial wastes that primarily comprise of organic dyes such as the Congo Red (CR) dye. On the other hand, semiconductors based nanomaterials have proven to be a powerful remediation tool for the polluted environment. Here in, we report an in situ approach for the development of strong interface via one pot hydrothermal synthesis of ZnTe/ZnSe heterostructures by precisely adjusting the chalcogens (Te/Se) concentration. The as-synthesized photocatalysts have further been characterized via various analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction for the phase confirmation, scanning electron microscopy together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for the morphological as well compositional analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy along with UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to plot the alignment of energy levels. Finally, the synthesized heterostructures have been employed as potential photocatalysts for the UV-visible induced degradation of the CR dye. The results reveal remarkable efficacy where heterostructured photocatalysts exhibit enhanced degradation efficiency for up to similar to 94% in 65 min. The synergy between the individual counterparts in heterostructure i.e. ZnTe and ZnSe, via the formation of a strong interface plays a significant role in photocatalytic CR fixation by suppressing the charge recombination which is also the key issue in these semiconductor nanomaterials.",
1990,"Evaluation of Chemical Parameters of Urban Drinking Water Quality along with Health Risk Assessment: A Case Study of Ardabil Province, Iran In recent years, in addition to water resources' quantity, their quality has also received much attention. In this study, the quality of the urban water distribution network in northwestern Iran was evaluated using the water quality index (WQI) method. Then, some important trace elements were investigated, and finally, the health risk assessment was evaluated for both carcinogenic elements (Ni, Cd, Cr, Pb, and As) and non-carcinogenic elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, F, NO(3), and Cu) using carcinogenic risk (CR) and hazard quotient (HQ), respectively. In the present study, the WQI was calculated based on both World Health Organization (WHO) and Iranian drinking water standards. Comparing the results of these standards revealed that the WQI based on the Iranian standard was slightly higher. Regarding the calculated WQI for the study region, the status of water quality for drinking consumption is in the good water quality class (25 < WQI < 50). It was observed that Cu and Cd have the highest and lowest concentrations in all sampling points, respectively. Hazard Index (HI) results showed that the non-carcinogenic substances studied had a low risk for both adults and children (<1.0). However, the CR results showed that Ni, Cd, and As were above the desired level for both children and adults. The results of this study can be applied for efficient water management and human health protection programs in the study area.",

Countries of South-East Asia, including Bangladesh, China, and India, are severely affected. In India, people residing in the middle and lower Gangetic planes and some Central and South-India areas characterized by hard rock terrain are worse affected by arsenic and fluoride contamination. These contaminants are introduced into groundwater through multiple sources, including both natural and anthropogenic sources. The last three decades have witnessed a vast amount of literature published on the concerned issues. This review analyzes the work-done on arsenic and fluoride contamination in the groundwater. It includes studies about the occurrence, co-occurrence, dissolution, and health effect. Mechanisms related to mobilization, toxicity, and removal techniques were also studied. Release mechanisms such as reductive dissolution, oxidation of sulfide minerals, alkali desorption, geothermal activity, contact time, and aqueous ionic concentrations were also discussed in detail, along with the mitigation techniques of arsenic and fluoride like adsorption, ion-exchange, biological methods, coagulation, and precipitation methods.",
1992,"Arsenic-induced micronuclei formation in mammalian cells and its counteraction by tea The Gangetic plain of West Bengal, India, has been engulfed by a disastrous environmental calamity of arsenic contamination of the ground water. Chronic arsenic toxicity caused by drinking arsenic-contaminated water has been one of the worst health hazards gradually affecting nine districts of West Bengal since the early 1980s. Over and above hyperpigmentation and keratosis, weakness, burning sensation of the eyes, swelling of the legs, liver fibrosis, chronic lung disease, gangrene of the toes, neuropathy, and skin cancer are other manifestations. Induction of cancer is frequently associated with DNA damage, changes in ploidy of cells, and non-random chromosome aberrations. Counteraction of these genotoxic and cytogenetic abnormalities with natural dietary polyphenols could be a useful strategy to combat arsenic-induced DNA damage and thereby cancer. A review of the literature showed that it is the antioxidant property of tea polyphenols that affords protection against various types of cancer. The present study was conducted to investigate whether the extracts of green tea and black tea (Darjeeling and Assam) as well as their polyphenols could ameliorate this arsenic-induced genotoxicity. The normal mammalian cell culture derived from male Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (V79) was used as the test system to assess the genotoxicity by micronucleus assay. The results showed that both green tea and black tea extracts have equal potential in modulating the arsenic-induced genotoxicity. This effect was perhaps induced by the constituent polyphenols present in green and black tea. In addition, the repair activity of the damaged cells was enhanced when treated with these tea extracts and their polyphenols. Thus, tea and its polyphenols may have a promising role in counteracting the devastating effects of arsenic.",
1993,"Groundwater quality safety evaluation based on health risk assessment Drinking water safety is an important part in water scientific field. The traditional living drinking-water quality assessment can not evaluate wholly the impacts of groundwater quality on human body. The groundwater health risk assessment is applied to evaluate the quality of groundwater providing to an important city in west of China in this paper. The analysis shows that health risk super standard ratio caused by chemical carcinogens arsenic is 23.8% in groundwater. The cancer-making risk of Cr(VI)is in the acceptable limits. The nitrate is the major non-carcinogen chronic toxic substance for arsenic, nitrate, fluoride and manganese. Health risk assessment which assesses the carcinogen risk and non-carcinogen risk shows that 71.43% groundwater quality impacts drinking people's health directly or indirectly. The groundwater health risk assessment analyzes the impacts of chemical carcinogen and non-carcinogen in groundwater on human body, so it can provide more deeply scientific support for quality safety and pollution control on groundwater.",
1994,"Water scarcity under various socio-economic pathways and its potential effects on food production in the Yellow River basin Increasing population and socio-economic development have put great pressure on water resources of the Yellow River (YR) basin. The anticipated climate and socioeconomic changes may further increase water stress. Many studies have investigated the changes in renewable water resources under various climate change scenarios, but few have considered the joint pressure from both climate change and socio-economic development. In this study, we assess water scarcity under various socio-economic pathways with emphasis on the impact of water scarcity on food production. The water demands in the 21st century are estimated based on the newly developed shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and renewable water supply is estimated using the climate projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The assessment predicts that the renewable water resources would decrease slightly then increase. The domestic and industrial water withdrawals are projected to increase in the next a few decades and then remain at the high level or decrease slightly during the 21st century. The increase in water withdrawals will put the middle and lower reaches in a condition of severe water scarcity beginning in the next a few decades. If 40% of the renewable water resources were used to sustain ecosystems, a portion of irrigated land would have to be converted to rain-fed agriculture, which would lead to a 2-11% reduction in food production. This study highlights the links between water, food and ecosystems in a changing environment and suggests that trade-offs should be considered when developing regional adaptation strategies.",
1995,"Magnetic susceptibility of ultrahigh pressure eclogite: The role of retrogression Retrograde metamorphism played the dominant role in changing the low-field rock magnetic properties and density of 198 specimens of variably retrograded eclogites from the main borehole of the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Project (CCSD) and from surface outcrops in the Donghai area in the southern part of the Sulu UHP belt, China. Bulk magnetic susceptibility (kappa) of unretrogressed UHP eclogite is controlled by whole-rock chemical composition and ranges from 397 to 2312 mu SI with principal magnetic susceptibility carrying minerals paramagnetic garnet, omphacite, rutile and phengite. Partially retrograded eclogites show large variations in magnetic susceptibility between 804 and 24,277 mu SI, with high mean magnetic susceptibility values of 4372 +/- 4149 mu SI caused by appreciable amounts of Fe-Ti oxide minerals such as magnetite, ilmenite and/or titanohematite produced by retrograde metamorphic reactions. Completely retrograded eclogites have lower susceptibilities of 1094 +/- 600 mu SI and amphibolite facies mineral assemblages lacking high magnetic susceptibility minerals. Jelinek's corrected anisotropy (P-j) of eclogites ranges from 1.001 to 1.540, and shows a positive correlation with low-field magnetic susceptibility (kappa). Arithmetic mean bulk density (rho) shows a steady decrease from 3.54 +/- 0.11 g/cm(3) (fresh eclogite) to 2.98 +/- 0.06 g/cm(3) (completely retrograded eclogite). Retrograde metamorphic changes in mineral composition during exhumation appear to be the major factor causing variations in low field magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy. Retrograde processes must be taken into account when interpreting magnetic surveys and geophysical well logs in UHP metamorphic terranes, and petrophysical properties such as density and low-field magnetic susceptibility could provide a means for semi-quantifying the degree of retrogression of eclogite during exhumation.

1996,"HAS PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN WATER AND SEWERAGE IMPROVED COVERAGE? EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM LATIN AMERICA Introducing private sector participation (PSP) into the water and sewerage sectors is difficult and controversial. Empirical studies on its effects are scant and generally inconclusive. Case studies tend to find improvements following privatisation, but they suffer front selection bias and it is difficult to generalise their results. To explore empirically the effects of private sector participation on coverage, we assemble a new dataset of connections to water and sewerage services at the city and province level based on household surveys in Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. The household surveys, conducted over a number of years, allow us to compile data before and after the introduction of private sector participation as well as from similar (control) regions did not privatise. Our analysis reveals that, in general, the share of households connected to piped water and sewerage improved following the introduction of private sector participation, consistent with the case study literature. We also find, however, that the share of households connected similarly improved in the control regions, suggesting that private sector participation, per se, may not have been responsible for those improvements. Results are similar when looking only at the poorest households. The share of poor households connected to piped water and sewerage increased similarly in areas both with and without private sector participation, suggesting that-in terms of connections at least-private sector participation did not harm the poor.

1997,"Bacteriological profile, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolates among street vended foods and hygienic practice of vendors in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia: a cross sectional study BACKGROUND: There are numerous advantages offered by street vended foods, but evidence exists that foods exposed for sale on the road side may be contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms. However, information on the bacteriological profile, bacterial load and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates from street food in Gondar town are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess bacterial profile, bacterial load, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates among street vended foods and also the hygienic practice of vendors in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Socio-demographic characteristics and the hygienic practices of 24 vendors were collected using structured questionnaire. A total of 72 food samples from four different food items were analyzed and counted by standard aerobic plate count method. Ten grams of each food sample was transferred in to 90â€‰ml of buffered peptone water and homogenized. The homogenates were serially dilute and a volume of 0.1â€‰ml dilution was spread on solid media and incubated at 35-37â€‰Â°C for 24â€‰h. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done for isolated species using Muller Hinton agar and data was entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: Seventy two food samples of street vended food were analysed for bacterial pathogens. 44/72 tested positive, a total of 63 isolates were identified as 19 samples contained two pathogens. The total mean aerobic bacterial count was 6.64â€‰Ã—â€‰10(4) CFU/g which is varied from 1â€‰Ã—â€‰10(4)-1.86â€‰Ã—â€‰10(5) CFU/g. S. aureus is the most frequent isolate 34 (53.96%) followed by E.coli 15(23.8%), Enterobacter species 10(15.87%) and Citrobacter species 4(6.3%). Gentamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were found to be the most effective antimicrobials against all isolates but the enterobactereaceae were resistant to ampicillin and Ceftaziidime and S.aureus were resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that, the majority of street-vended food items in Gondar were contaminated with one or more different pathogenic bacteria. The presence of these bacteria in foods could lead to potential health problems for consumers. Therefore, health education as well as training in food safety and hygienic handling is required for food handlers to minimize contamination and the likelihood of people falling ill.",
1998,"DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PHYSICAL MODEL FOR EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF EXPANDABLE CASING TECHNOLOGY EFFECT ON WELLBORE CEMENT INTEGRITY The focus of this novel research was to develop a physical model and apply an experimental approach to explore the effect of casing expansion technology on wellbore cement integrity. Wellbore cements are an intricate component of stable wellbore integrity which provides zonal isolation, mechanical reinforcement of the casing and protects casing from corrosive fluids [1]. Theoretical water/cement ratio to provide cement slurry mixture with no porosity is 0.32, while cement slurries used in the oil industry are designed with water/cement ratio of 0.38 and higher. Cement sheaths are associated with many types of failure which can occur during and after cementing operations. During cementing operations insufficient mud removal and improper cement placement might lead lack of zonal isolation, while operational load events such as pressure testing casing and stimulation treatments can lead to debonding at cement/formation and cement/casing interfaces, while risk of cement matrix fracturing increases when well is subjected to varying loads during production [2]. These cement failures will result in micro-channeling, leading to gas migration and occurrence of Sustained Casing Pressure (SCP) at the surface of the well. SCP is a risk for longterm well integrity and environmental risk. There are 8,000 to 11,000 wells in Gulf of Mexico with SCP, and approximately 50% of the casing strings exhibiting sustained casing pressure are production casings [3]. Once casing diagnostic tests show that SCP exceeds the Maximum Allowable Wellhead Operating Pressure (MAWOP), remediation operations are required [4]. These remedial operations are costly and commonly unsuccessful. Usually, the most used remedial operation, such as squeeze cementing has a very low success rate of some 50% [5]. Approximately 15% of primary cement jobs result in insufficient zonal isolation, costing the oil and gas industry an estimated $450 million annually in remedial cement works [6]. Our study offers a unique approach to the use of expandable casing technology, in which this mechanical manipulation compresses the cement sheath, closing cement matrix annuli, thus serving as a more successful remediation operation for SCP. Expandable tubular technology reduces drilling cost and increases production capability by allowing optimum diameter production casing installation [7]. This technology can be applied in existing or new wells and the products that have been used most to date are the cased-hole liner and openhole liner [8]. It is extensively used in Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) wells in order to cut the drilling cost and preserve an optimum diameter at required reservoir depth [9]. Casing expansion is in most cases accomplished by an expansion cone or a mandrel. Progress of the cone through the pipe expands it beyond its elastic limit, but still keeping stresses below the yield stress.",
1999,"ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION BY METALS IN THE OIL BEARING BAKASSI PENINSULA, CAMEROON The weight fractions of the nutrients and toxic elements have been determined in environmental and foodstuff samples in the oil bearing Bakassi Peninsula. This study is highly justified by the occurrence of many offshore production platforms in the peninsula that could lead to the environmental pollution. The use of a Quant'X EDXRF spectrometer and the Fundamental Parameter approach for quantification of the results enabled us to increase sensitivity and accuracy in the analysis of soil and foodstuffs. The results obtained for soil samples exhibit a predominance of iron and the presence of lead. Mercury and cadmium are below the detection limit. The analysis of foodstuffs shows a high content of potassium and calcium. Concerning water, the analysis also shows a high content of iron (Fe) (2.18 +/- 0.04) mg/L in tap water, 10 times above the accepted limit value. Concentrations of lead (2.58 +/- 0.01) mg/L in tap water and (0.30 +/- 0.01) mg/L in rain water have been determined. No cadmium has been detected in tap water but its presence (0.80 +/- 0.01) mg/L in rain water is probably due to the atmospheric deposition.",
2000,"Low-level lead exposure promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and contributes to the elevation of fasting glucose level Background: Lead (Pb) is considered an endocrine-disrupting chemical. However, few studies have investigated the effects of low-level Pb exposure on plasma glucose levels. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether low-level Pb exposure causes elevated plasma glucose levels and the possible mechanisms involved. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 5747 participants from 16 sites in China. The participants underwent measurements of anthropometric factors, blood lead level (BLL) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Wistar rats were exposed to 0.05% Pb through drinking water or fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 28 weeks. The relevant parameters of glucose homeostasis, hepatic glucose production (HGP) and gene expression levels of hepatic gluconeogenesis enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), were measured. In addition, gene expression levels of gluconeogenesis enzymes were also measured in HepG2 cells administered with different concentrations of lead acetate for 24 h. Results: In humans, after adjusting for confounders, the odds of having High_FPG (>= 5.6 mmol/L) were significantly increased by 25% in the participants in the fourth BLL quartile (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05, 1.49). In the animals exposed to 0.05% Pb, FPG, HGP and hepatic gene expression levels of PEPCK, G6PC and FBP1 were increased. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of PEPCK, G6PC and FBP1 in HepG2 cells were also increased in response to Pb exposure. Conclusions: These findings support the possibility that low-level Pb exposure may increase HGP by affecting key enzymes of hepatic gluconeogenesis, eventually resulting in impaired FPG and hyperglycemia.

2001,"Buttock responses to contact with finishing materials over the ONDOL floor heating system in Korea The ONDOL is a conventional floor heating system in Korea. Eight healthy college students volunteered as the subjects to investigate the buttock responses to contact with 10 types of the ONDOL covering materials: mortar, plywood, artificial marble, PVC, rubber foam, tempered glass, steel, insulation mortar, carpet, and aluminum. The temperature of water supply flowing into the floor coil underneath the floor surface was altered from 15 to 40 degreesC at 5 degreesC intervals. Floor surface temperature, skin temperature including buttock and subjective thermal sensation were monitored. The study revealed that the lower the contact coefficient of covering material, the more stable the temperature fluctuations in the floor surface and the buttock skin were. The floor finishing material should be chosen by the heat flux based on the heating load, and the friendship to human body. Using regression analysis, the neutral temperature of the buttock was determined at 32.6 degreesC. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2002,"Spatial variation of fipronil and its derivatives in tap water and ground water from China and the fate of them during drinking water treatment in Wuhan, central China Fipronil (FP) is an emerging insecticide, however, its occurrence in drinking water and source water is limited. In this work, a total of 789 tap water and 95 ground water samples were collected from China in June 2019 in order to assess occurrence of FP and its derivatives (FPs). FPs were also analyzed in source, treated (nÂ =Â 10, July), and tap water samples (nÂ =Â 81, July and October 2019) originating from the central Yangtze River and its tributary, the Hanshui River in Wuhan. The sum concentrations of FPs (Î£FPs) in the tap water in China ranged from not detected (ND) to 5.07 (median: 0.03Â ng/L), with FP found in 55.3% of the samples, and other targetsÂ â‰¤Â 50.0%. Significant regional variations in the Î£FPs values were found between East China (75th percentile: 0.31Â ng/L) and Northwest China (0.04), as well as between East China and North China (0.04). Similar Î£FPs values were found for ground water and tap water. The estimated daily intake of Î£FPs via water ingestion was below 200 pg/kg-bw/day for all age groups and was lower than the reference dose for FP (0.2 Î¼g/kg-bw/day). Additionally, FPs were found in all of the source water samples collected in Wuhan with concentrations in the range of 0.84-2.72Â ng/L for Î£FPs (median: 2.39). Most of these FPs were removed during water treatment. Higher concentration of Î£FPs in tap water was observed in July (median: 0.04Â ng/L) compared to that in October (ND). This is the first study on the occurrence of FPs in the Yangtze River, the fate of FPs during the tap water treatment, and the regional distribution of FPs in tap water from China.",
2003,"Water resources of India Water resources of a country constitute one of its vital assets. India receives annual precipitation of about 4000 km(3). The rainfall in India shows very high spatial and temporal variability and paradox of the situation is that Mousinram near Cherrapunji, which receives the highest rainfall in the world, also suffers from a shortage of water during the non-rainy season, almost every year. The total average annual flow per year for the Indian rivers is estimated as 1953 km(3). The total annual replenishable groundwater resources are assessed as 432 km(3). The annual utilizable surface water and groundwater resources of India are estimated as 690 km(3) and 396 km(3) per year, respectively. With rapid growing population and improving living standards the pressure on our water resources is increasing and per capita availability of water resources is reducing day by day. Due to spatial and temporal variability in precipitation the country faces the problem of flood and drought syndrome. Over-exploitation of groundwater is leading to reduction of low flows in the rivers, declining of the groundwater resources, and salt water intrusion in aquifers of the coastal areas. Over canal-irrigation in some of the command areas has resulted in waterlogging and salinity. The quality of surface and groundwater resources is also deteriorating because of increasing pollutant loads from point and non-point sources. The climate change is expected to affect precipitation and water availability. So far, the data collection, processing, storage and dissemination have not received adequate attention. The efforts initiated under the Hydrology Project Phase-I and the development of the Decision Support System proposed under Hydrology Project Phase-II are expected to bridge some of the gaps between the developed advanced technologies of water resources planning, designing and management and their field applications. The paper presents availability and demands of water resources in India as well as describes the various issues and strategies for developing a holistic approach for sustainable development and management of the water resources of the country. It also highlights integration of the blue and green flows and concepts of virtual water transfer for sustainable management of the water resources for meeting the demands of the present, without compromising the needs of future generations.",
2004,"Spatiotemporal Evaluation of Water Quality and Hazardous Substances in Small Coastal Streams According to Watershed Characteristics In this study, spatial and temporal changes of eight water quality indicators and 30 types of hazardous substances including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), pesticides, and inorganic matters for the small coastal streams along the West Coast of South Korea were investigated. In coastal streams with clear seasonal changes in water quality, larger watershed areas led to greater contamination by particulate matter (i.e., suspended solids, r = 0.89), and smaller watershed areas led to greater contamination by organic matter (i.e., BOD, r = -0.78). The concentration of VOCs and pesticides was higher in agricultural areas, and those of SVOCs and metals were often higher in urban areas. According to the principal component analysis (PCA), during the wet season, the fluctuation in the water quality of coastal streams was higher in urban areas than in agricultural areas. Furthermore, coastal streams in residential areas exhibited higher levels of SVOCs, and those in industrial areas exhibited higher levels of metallic substances. Based on these results, the spatial and temporal trends of water quality and hazardous substances were obtained according to watershed characteristics, thereby clarifying the pollution characteristics of small-scale coastal streams and the major influencing factors.",
2005,"Single-indicator-based Multidimensional Sensing: Detection and Identification of Heavy Metal Ions and Understanding the Foundations from Experiment to Simulation Multidimensional sensing offers advantages in accuracy, diversity and capability for the simultaneous detection and discrimination of multiple analytes, however, the previous reports usually require complicated synthesis/fabrication process and/or need a variety of techniques (or instruments) to acquire signals. Therefore, to take full advantages of this concept, simple designs are highly desirable. Herein, a novel concept is conceived to construct multidimensional sensing platforms based on a single indicator that has capability of showing diverse color/fluorescence responses with the addition of different analytes. Through extracting hidden information from these responses, such as red, green and blue (RGB) alterations, a triple-channel-based multidimensional sensing platform could consequently be fabricated, and the RGB alterations are further applicable to standard statistical methods. As a proof-of-concept study, a triple-channel sensing platform is fabricated solely using dithizone with assistance of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) for hyperchromicity and sensitization, which demonstrates superior capabilities in detection and identification of ten common heavy metal ions at their standard concentrations of wastewater-discharge of China. Moreover, this sensing platform exhibits promising applications in semi-quantitative and even quantitative analysis individuals of these heavy metal ions with high sensitivity as well. Finally, density functional theory calculations are performed to reveal the foundations for this analysis.",
2006,"Effects of Arsenic and Iron on the Community and Abundance of Arsenite-Oxidizing Bacteria in an Arsenic-Affected Groundwater Aquifer Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater aquifers is a global environmental problem, especially in South and Southeast Asian regions, and poses a risk to human health. Arsenite-oxidizing bacteria that transform As(III) to less toxic As(V) can be potentially used as a groundwater As remediation strategy. This study aimed to examine the community and abundance of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in groundwater with various As concentrations from Rayong Province, Thailand using PCR-cloning-sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of catalytic subunit of arsenite oxidase gene (aioA). Key factors influencing their community and abundance were also identified. The results demonstrated that arsenite-oxidizing bacteria retrieved from groundwater were phylogenetically related to Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. The aioA gene abundances ranged from 8.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10(1) to 1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10(4) copies per ng of genomic DNA, accounting for 0.16-1.37% of the total 16S rRNA bacterial gene copies. Although the abundance of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in groundwater was low, groundwater with As(III) dominance likely promoted their abundance which possibly played an important role in chemolithoautotrophic oxidation of As(III) to As(V). Fe and As(III) were the major environmental factors influencing the community and abundance of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to further contribute to the development of bioremediation strategies for As removal from groundwater resources.",
2007,"High adsorption capability and selectivity of ZnO nanoparticles for dye removal In this study, the removal of both cationic dye (malachite green, called MG for short) and anionic dyes (acid fuchsin and Congo red, called AF and CR) by ZnO nanoparticles from aqueous solution was investigated. The adsorption process is dependent on pH and temperature. The adsorption for MG, AF, and CR is spontaneous and exothermic. The adsorption process can be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity is 2963, 3307, and 1554 mg/g for MG, AF, and CR in this work, respectively. Chemical precipitation, electrostatic attraction, and hydrogen bonding are mainly responsible for the binding mechanism. The used ZnO nanoparticles could be reused for five cycles without a significant loss of adsorption ability. Furthermore, the ZnO nanoparticles showed selective adsorption in the case of mixed dyes. Overall, we provide a highly effective and selective adsorbent with reusability in multi-dye adsorption system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2008,"Preferential transport of nitrate to a tile drain in an intermittent-flood-irrigated field: Model development and experimental evaluation A comprehensive field experiment was conducted near Las Nutrias, New Mexico, to study field-scale how and transport in the vadose zone. The field data were analyzed in terms of a two-dimensional numerical model based on the Richards equation for variably saturated water flow, convection-dispersion equations with first-order chemical decay chains for solute transport, and bimodal piecewise-continuous unsaturated hydraulic functions to account for preferential flow of water and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N; loosely used as NO3-) following flood irrigation events at the experimental site. The model was tested against measured NO3- flux concentrations in a subsurface tile drain, several monitoring wells and nested piezometers, and against resident NO3- concentrations in the soil profile (obtained at 52 spatial locations and four depths along a transect). NO3- transport at the field site could be described better with the bimodal hydraulic functions than using the conventional approach with unimodal van Genuchten-Mualem type hydraulic functions. Average resident nitrate concentrations measured across the soil profile were predicted reasonably well. However, NO3- flux concentrations in the subsurface tile drain and piezometers at the field site were occasionally underestimated or overestimated depending upon the irrigation sequence in three field benches, probably reflecting unrepresented three-dimensional regional flow/transport processes. Limiting the capture zone to a region closer to the tile drain did lead to a better match with observed sharp increases and decreases in predicted NO3- flux concentrations during the irrigation; events. On the basis of this result we inferred that the preferential flow intercepted by the tile drain was generated in close proximity of the drain and essentially oriented vertically. In summary, our study suggests that irrigation scheduling in adjacent field plots, drainage design (e.g., spacing between tiles, drain depth, drain diameter) and effectiveness (e.g., drain blockage), preferential flow in (horizontal) surface-opened Shallow cracks and (vertical) macropores, and transient regional groundwater flow can add significant uncertainty to the predictions of (local-scale) flow and transport to a tile drain.",
2009,"Oral glucose-electrolyte therapy for diarrhea: a means to maintain or improve nutrition? Since over half of the children aged 5 years and under in the developing world suffer from mild-moderate malnutrition, means of correcting nutrition deficiencies are essential. In the case of the child with diarrhea, malnutrition is exacerbated by a number of disease-related factors including anorexia, cultural or medical withdrawal of food, and purgation. It was discovered, in a study among Apache children, that early and rapid replacemtnt of volume loss and correction of electrolyte imbalance using glucose-electrolyte solutions administered orally can restore physical well-being and appetite to children suffering from acute diarrhea, and hence enhance these children's nutritional status. The solution recommended contained, in millimolar concentrations per liter: sodium, 81; potassium, 18; choride, 71; HC03, 28; and glucose, 139. A field trial of oral therapy for acute diarrhea in children is called for tod etermine the extent of effects on nutrition and mortality, as well as to indicate some of the cultural and logistical problems which remain to be solved. eng",
2010,"CFD modeling of immiscible liquids turbulent dispersion in Kenics static mixers: Focusing on droplet behavior The present study is concerned with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of turbulent dispersion of immiscible liquids, namely, water-silicone oil and water-benzene through Kenics static mixers using the Eulerian-Eulerian and Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches of the ANSYS Fluent 16.0 software. To study the droplet size distribution (DSD), the Eulerian formulation incorporating a population balance model (PBM) was employed. For the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, a discrete phase model (DPM) in conjunction with the Eulerian approach for continuous phase simulation was used to predict the residence time distribution (RTD) of droplets. In both approaches, a shear stress transport (SST) k - omega turbulence model was used. For validation purposes, the simulated results were compared with the experimental data and theoretical values for the Fanning friction factor, Sauter mean diameter and the mean residence time. The reliability of the computational model was further assessed by comparing the results with the available empirical correlations for Fanning friction factor and Sauter mean diameter. In addition, the influence of important geometrical and operational parameters, including the number of mixing elements and Weber number, was studied. It was found that the proposed models are capable of predicting the performance of the Kenics static mixer reasonably well.

2011,"ENHANCING DROUGHT TOLERANCE IN CAMELINA SATIVA L. AND CANOLA (BRASSICA NAPUS L.) THROUGH APPLICATION OF SELENIUM Considering the burning issue the present study was undertaken in pot culture at the Cholistan Institute of Desert Studies (CIDS), The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan for enhancing drought tolerance in two oilseed crops (OC) crops camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and canola (Canola napus L.) through improving physiological, biochemical, and antioxidants activity by foliar application of selenium (Se) under drought stress. Two Camelina (i.e., 'Australian Camelina' and 'Canadian Camelina') and canola genotypes (i.e., `AARI Canola' and `UAF Canola') were used as plant materials during the growing season of 2016. Both Camelina and Canola genotypes were grown under normal (100% FC) and water deficit (drought stress) (40% FC) conditions. Four levels of Se: such as seeds priming with 75 mu M Se, foliar application of Se at 7.06 mu M and foliar Se in combination with seeds priming (7.06 mu M & 75 mu M) along with control were applied at the vegetative stage of both OC crops for screening drought tolerant genotypes. All treatments were arranged three times in a randomized complete block design. Both OC crops were grown upto the maturity and data on physiochemical, antioxidants and yield components were recorded during this study. Results of the present study indicated that the physio-biochemical parameters such as WP (water potential), OP (osmotic potential), TP (turgor pressure), proline, TSS (total soluble sugar), TFAA (total free amino acids), TPr (total proteins) and TS (total sugars); and total chlorophyll contents were improved by foliar application Se along with seed priming by Se in both OC crops in both drought stress and non -stress (control) conditions. Similarly, osmoprotectants such as GB (Glycinebetaine), anthocyanin, TPC (total phenolic contents) and flavonoids; as well as antioxidants such as APX (ascorbate peroxidase), SOD (superoxide dismutase), POD (peroxidase) and CAT (catalase) were also showed better enhancement in both OC crops through foliar application in combination with seed priming with Se (7.06 mu M & 75 mu M) under normal as well as water deficit (drought) conditions. Yield and its components i.e., branches plant(-1) (no.), 1000 -seed weight (g), seed and biological yield (t ha(-1)) of both OC crops were increased through foliar application in combination with seed priming by Se (7.06 mu M & 75 mu M) under drought and non-drought stress conditions. Both camelina and Canola genotypes categorized based on all the above-mentioned parameters under the water deficit (drought stress) condition and foliar application of Se, the genotype 'Canadian Camelina' maintained the highest values for all these attributes. Therefore, it is revealed that foliar application in combination with seed priming by Se helps to improve drought tolerance of OC crops and also leads to an increase in the productivity of crops under drought stress. Among the genotypes, 'Canadian Camelina' performed the best when seeds of the genotypes were primed with Se in combination with foliar application of Se at the vegetative stage.",
2012,"GA(3)-MEDIATED DORMANCY ALLEVIATION IN THE REPUTED AFRICAN POTATO, HYPOXIS HEMEROCALLIDEA Background: Hypoxis hemerocallidea, arguably the most well-known medicinal species in South Africa, has been the subject of intensive harvesting from the wild leading to recent conservation concerns. The seeds of this species do not propagate easily and can lie dormant for up to twelve months. Materials and Methods: In the in vitro germination experiments water, acid and chemical pre-sowing treatments were performed to determine the germination response of this species in both light and dark conditions. In the ex vitro experiment, intact seeds were sown and left to germinate in a potting soil mix under greenhouse conditions. Results: Highest levels of germination (36.7-60.0% in the light and 36.7-46.7% in the dark) were achieved by treating mechanically scarified seeds with GA(3) at various concentrations for 24 h. This was followed by scarified seeds soaked in water (26.7% in the light and 23.3% in the dark). Similar results (23.3 and 26.7%) were obtained in the 1% and 4% KNO3 treatments, respectively, under light conditions only. The fastest time to germinate was two days and was obtained in the 1200 ppm GA(3) treatment in both light and dark conditions. Ex vitro germination of H. hemerocallidea seeds under greenhouse conditions was unsuccessful. Conclusion: H. hemerocallidea displays physical and non-deep physiological dormancy where pre-sowing treatments are required before the seeds will germinate.",
2013,"Genotypic differences in root and shoot growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown under different salinity levels In water-limited areas of Tunisia, more than 30% of subsurface water used for irrigation is saline water, leading to a long-term salinization and degradation processes. To prevent the problems and to minimize the negative impact of using saline water, selection of proper germplasm as well as integrated soil and water management are essential. Understanding the diversity for salt tolerance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes will facilitate their use in genetic improvement. Our objectives were to evaluate, in green, house-salt tolerance for 14 barley cultivars under three different salinity levels: (tap water with an Ec = 0.73 dSm-1, tap water with 102 mM of NaCl, Ec = 10.76 dSm-1 and tap water with 151 mM of NaCl, Ec = 15.38 dSm-1), and quantify genetic variation based on salt tolerance index, morphological traits, molecular and factorial analysis of correspondence (FAC). The study was conducted in a randomized complete block design arranged as a split plot. The results indicate a great genetic variability to salt tolerance among used barley genotypes. Consequently, it is possible to identify superior cultivars, and evaluate the genotypic performance under salinities conditions. In addition, results obtained were confirmed by clustering made by SSR tool on the base of DNA analysis, which is compatible with the arrangement obtained with statistical method.",
2014,"The good water quality on Cu in Jiaozhou Bay waters We analyzed the contents, horizontal distributions and pollution sources of Cu in Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, China in 1984. Results showed that Cu contents in surface waters in July, August and October 1984 were 0.28-1.88 mu g L-1, 1.60-4.00 mu g L-1 and 0.11-2.00 mu g L-1, respectively, and were confirmed with Grade. (5.00 mu g L-1) in Chinese Sea Water Quality Standard (GB 3097-1997). The major sources of Cu were river flow and ocean current, whose source strengths were 1.88-4.00 mu g L-1 and 2.00 mu g L-1, respectively. The source strengths and pollution levels of Cu in Jiaozhou Bay were very weak and low in 1984. These founding were helpful to understanding the background level of Cu in the early stage of reform and opening up, as well as the research on the existence of Cu.",
2015,"Advancing greenhouse gas emission factors for municipal wastewater treatment plants in China Estimations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) remain significant uncertainties in China owing to a lack of reliable emission factors (EFs). This study developed a framework to obtain multi-level (technology, province, and nation) GHG EFs of MWTPs using a database containing 3107 MWTPs in China and published site-specific monitoring data. Results show that GHG EFs of different technologies range widely from 180.0 to 615.7Â g CO(2)-eq/t wastewater, and significant differences are also observed among different provinces in China (190.5-600.3Â g CO(2)-eq/t wastewater), which are generally lower than the previous estimates. It confirms the importance of more detailed technology classification and considering the technological disparity of different provinces in refining GHG estimations of MWTPs. To test the feasibility of the developed EFs, we compared GHG emissions from MWTPs based on multi-level EFs at different spatial and temporal scales. Similar estimation results imply that selecting corresponding EF depending on the availability of activity data would simplify GHG estimations of MWTPs without sacrificing much accuracy. This study contributes a set of well-developed EFs to improve the estimates of GHG emissions from MWTPs, and also offers a method to develop GHG EFs for other sectors.",
2016,"The Arsenic Concentration in Saliva, Urine and Drinking Water in Endemic Arsenicosis Area in Shanyin County of Shanxi Province, China Biological monitoring for arsenic is usually based upon a determination of urine, blood, nail and hair arsenic concentration, however, saliva has been suggested as a non-invasive biological matrix for assessing exposure. To further evaluate the potential utility of saliva for arsenicbiomonitoring, Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry(AFS-230) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) were used to evaluate the concentration of arsenic in drinking water, saliva and urine in endemic arsenicosis area in Shanyin County of Shanxi Province. The results showed that the arsenic concentration in drinking water was 0.55-720.0ug/L, and there were 66.67% samples above the arsenic level (50 mu g/L) of standards for drinking water quality. The median value of arsenic in drinking water was 127.22 mu g/L. The salivary and urinary arsenic both can reflect the exposure of arsenic in drinking water. Additionally, there was a significant positive association of salivary arsenic compared with arsenic in drinking water (r=0.674, P<0.05)and urinary arsenic(r=0.794, P<0.05). These results demonstrated that, similar to urinary arsenic, salivary arsenic also can be used as a biomarker for assessing human exposue to arsenic.",
2017,"Assessing antibiotic resistance profiles in Escherichia coli and Salmonella species from groundwater in the Mafikeng area, South Africa Escherichia coli and Salmonella species occur as normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans. However, pathogenic strains exist that cause disease in humans. Infections may result from the consumption of water and food contaminated with faeces of human and animal origin. In South Africa, residents of most rural communities rely on untreated ground water for survival. This practice results to the transfer of pathogenic micro-organism to humans and thus amplifies the need to identify contaminated water systems. Results obtained may adequately address water quality problems and hence protect public health. The study was conducted to isolate and determine the antibiotic resistance profiles of E. coli and Salmonella species from the groundwater obtained from two rural communities in the North-West province, S.A. Nineteen ground water samples were analyzed for characters of E. coli and Salmonella species. Only those isolates that satisfied all the primary (oxidase and the triple sugar iron) and secondary identification criteria (API 20E and rapid slide agglutination test) for E. coli and Salmonella species were used. A total of 63 E. coli and 64 Salmonella isolates were identified. The antibiotic susceptibilities of these isolates were evaluated against a panel of 10 antibiotics. A large proportion (56.7 to 57.6%) of the E. coli isolated from both Dibate and Verdwall were resistant to vancomycin. Similarly, large proportions (51.5 to 78.8%) of the E. coli isolated from Verdwall were resistant to ampicilin and erythromycin when compared to those isolated from Dibate. Furthermore, a higher percentage (90.0 to 100%) of Salmonella isolated from both Dibate and Verdwall were resistant to ampicillin, erythromycin and vancomycin. AP-E-VA was the predominant phenotype for E. coli isolated from both Dibate and Verdwall in 40 and 20%, respectively, while the phenotypes AP-E-T-VA and AP-E-VA were dominant among the Salmonella species isolated in this study. The results indicated that E. coli and Salmonella could serve as indicator organisms necessary to assess the quality of ground water and their levels are critical parameters that could help to drive management strategies. This will limit the effect of these pathogens on consumers, as some water samples were visibly identified to be contaminated.",
2018,"Hydrological evaluation of open-access precipitation data using SWAT at multiple temporal and spatial scales Temporal and spatial precipitation information is key to conducting effective hydrological-process simulation and forecasting. Herein, we implemented a comprehensive evaluation of three selected precipitation products in the Jialing River watershed (JRW) located in southwestern China. A number of indices were used to statistically analyze the differences between two open-access precipitation products (OPPs), i.e., Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Climate Prediction Center Gauge-Based Analysis of Global Daily Precipitation (CPC), and the rain gauge (Gauge). The three products were then categorized into subbasins to drive SWAT simulations. The results show the following. (1) The three products are highly consistent in temporal variation on a monthly scale yet distinct on a daily scale. CHIRPS is characterized by an overestimation of light rain, underestimation of heavy rain, and high probability of false alarm. CPC generally underestimates rainfall of all magnitudes. (2) Both OPPs satisfactorily reproduce the stream discharges at the JRW outlet with slightly worse performance than the Gauge model. Model with CHIRPS as inputs performed slightly better in both model simulation and fairly better in uncertainty analysis than that of CPC. On a temporal scale, the OPPs are inferior with respect to capturing flood peak yet superior at describing other hydrograph features, e.g., rising and falling processes and baseflow. On a spatial scale, CHIRPS offers the advantage of deriving smooth, distributed precipitation and runoff due to its high resolution. (3) The water balance components derived from SWAT models with equal simulated streamflow discharges are remarkably different between the three precipitation inputs. The precipitation spatial pattern results in an increasing surface flow trend from upstream to downstream. The results of this study demonstrate that with similar performance in simulating watershed runoff, the three precipitation datasets tend to conceal the identified dissimilarities through hydrological-model parameter calibration, which leads to different directions of hydrologic processes. As such, multiple-objective calibration is recommended for large and spatially resolved watersheds in future work. The main findings of this research suggest that the features of OPPs facilitate the widespread use of CHIRPS in extreme flood events and CPC in extreme drought analyses in future climate.",
2019,"Valorization of solid waste from the tannery industry: Preparation of adsorbent by cost effective method Leather industry, one of the polluting industries because of generation of huge amount of liquid and solid wastes, also obnoxious smell because of degradation of proteinous material of skin Solid wastes are raw trimmings, fleshings, chrome shavings, buffing dusts and keratin wastes. Accumulation of these wastes lead to sludge problem and choking of treatment pipes and finally results in reduction in efficiency of treatment plant. Treatment of solid wastes also is not cost effective, posing economic burden to the tanners. Leather industry in the developing countries is facing lot of solid wastes problem and many tanneries closed for not meeting bio-chemical oxygen BOD) demand and total dissolved solids (TDS) norms. The objective of this paper is to review the kinds of solid wastes generated in leather industry and the useful technologies developed to overcome the solid wastes problem.In the commen effluent treatment plant Dual media filter is used to remove color, suspended solid, turbidity, BOD. In the dual media filter sand and pebbles and carbon are used for removing suspended solid and color. Instead these filter media we can use solid waste from tannery industries. In recent years, the need for safe and economical methods for the elimination of suspended solid and color and heavy metals from contaminated waters has necessitated research interest towards the production of low cost adsorbent. Therefore there is an urgent need that all possible sources of inexpensive adsorbents should be explored and their feasibility for the removal of suspended solid, color and heavy metals should be studied in detail. There is an availability of solid waste and possibility of use in tannery industries area. The main feature of this project is to increase the value creation process through the research i.e, utilization of solid waste with economical method and save the environment.

2020,"Concentration of Radioactive Materials for the Phanerozoic Plutonic Rocks in Korea and Its Implication In recent years, various social issues related to the natural radioactive elements detected in household goods and building materials are addressed, and should be solved promptly. In Korea, for more than 20 years, the Ministry of Environment has investigated the natural radioactive materials such as heavy metals, uranium, and radon in soil or groundwater. The origins of natural radioactive materials in them may have a close correlation with the geological factors including classification of rocks, petrogenetic origins, and deformation characteristics, but the exact geological correlations are not clarified because of the absence of the government policy preserved in the basement rocks, soils as well as groundwater in fault-related reservoirs. This study aims to perform a research on the correlation between the petrogeneses of the Phanerozoic plutonic rocks and natural radioactive concentrations in rocks (radon, uranium, thorium, potassium etc.) in Korea. Among the Phanerozoic plutonic rocks, alkaline plutonic rocks (syenite, monzonite and monzodiorite and alkali granite) show high U and Th concentrations by high solubilities of U, Th, Zr, REF, and Nb until the most extreme stages of magmatic fractionation (viz. crystal fractionation) due to high magma temperature and high alkalinity tendency. The highly fractionated high-K calalkaline and peraluminous granitic rocks (leucogranite, two-mica granite and leucocratic pegmatite are also U and Th concentrations compared with other less or medium fractionated granitic rocks (diorite, granodiorite and granite). The alkaline plutonic rocks are associated with intracontinental rifling and extensional environment after crustal thickening by collisional and subductional processes. In contrast, the dominant sale-alkaline granitic rocks in Korea are related to the arc environment of the subduction zone. In summary, the trends of the U, Th and K concentration from the Phanerozoic plutonic rocks in Korea are closely linked to the petrogenesis of the rocks in tectonic environment. The preliminary data for gamma-spectrometric mesumients of natural radionuclide contents (Ra-126, Th-232 and K-40) in the Phanerozoic plutonic rocks show high values in the alkaline and highly fractionated granitic rocks.",
2021,"A combined method for evaluating radon and progeny in waters and its use at Guarani aquifer, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil A combined method for evaluating radon (222Rn) and progeny (214Pb and 214Bi) in water was developed by using inexpensive alpha scintillation counting and gamma ray spectrometry through NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors. A groundwater sample collected at the PoÃ§os de Caldas alkaline massif in Brazil was submitted to the technique in order to assure its applicability by comparing the volumetric activities by different methods. Similar volumetric activity was determined for 214Pb and 214Bi in the sample analyzed that is compatible with the expected condition of radioactive equilibrium between these nuclides. The combined method was successfully used to analyze groundwater samples from Guarani aquifer in SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil, and the results of the measurements indicated that 214Pb and 214Bi provide useful information concerning the evaluation of the drinking water quality in terms of radiological aspects. This is because they are directly identified in the water samples, without the need of requiring the assumption of the establishment of the transient equilibrium condition with its parent 222Rn.",
2022,"Determination of major sodium iodide symporter (NIS) inhibitors in drinking waters using ion chromatography with conductivity detector Goiter is an important health problem all over the world and iodine deficiency is its most common cause. Perchlorate, thiocyanate and nitrate (called as major NIS inhibitors) are known to competitively inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid gland and thus, human exposure to major NIS inhibitors is a public health concern. In this study, an ion chromatographic method for the determination of most common NIS inhibitor ions in drinking waters was developed and validated. This is the first study where an analytical method is used for the determination of major NIS inhibitors in drinking water by an ion chromatography system in a single run. Chromatographic separations were achieved with an anion-exchange column and separated ions were identified by a conductivity detector. The method was found to be selective, linear, precise accurate and true for all of interested ions. The limits of the detections (LOD) were estimated at 0.003, 0.004 and 0.025mgL(-1) for perchlorate, thiocyanate and nitrate, respectively. Possible interference ions in drinking waters were examined for the best separation of NIS inhibitors. The excellent method validation data and proficiency test result (Z-score for nitrate: -0.1) of the FAPAS(Â®) suggested that the developed method could be applied for determination of NIS inhibitor residues in drinking waters. To evaluate the usefulness of the method, 75 drinking water samples from Antalya/Turkey were analyzed for NIS inhibitors. Perchlorate concentrations in the samples ranged from not detected (less than LOD) to 0.07Â±0.02mgL(-1) and the range of nitrate concentrations were found to be 3.60Â±0.01mgL(-1) and 47.42Â±0.40mgL(-1). No thiocyanate residues were detected in tested drinking water samples.",
2023,"Comparative Risk Assessment of spill response options for a deepwater oil well blowout: Part 1. Oil spill modeling Oil spill model simulations of a deepwater blowout in the Gulf of Mexico De Soto Canyon, assuming no intervention and various response options (i.e., subsea dispersant injection SSDI, in addition to mechanical recovery, in-situ burning, and surface dispersant application) were compared. Predicted oil fate, amount and area of surfaced oil, and exposure concentrations in the water column above potential effects thresholds were used as inputs to a Comparative Risk Assessment to identify response strategies that minimize long-term impacts. SSDI reduced human and wildlife exposure to volatile organic compounds; dispersed oil into a large water volume at depth; enhanced biodegradation; and reduced surface water, nearshore and shoreline exposure to floating oil and entrained/dissolved oil in the upper water column. Tradeoffs included increased oil exposures at depth. However, since organisms are less abundant below 200â€¯m, results indicate that overall exposure of valued ecosystem components was minimized by use of SSDI.",
2024,"A metagenomic window into carbon metabolism at 3 km depth in Precambrian continental crust Subsurface microbial communities comprise a significant fraction of the global prokaryotic biomass; however, the carbon metabolisms that support the deep biosphere have been relatively unexplored. In order to determine the predominant carbon metabolisms within a 3-km deep fracture fluid system accessed via the Tau Tona gold mine (Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa), metagenomic and thermodynamic analyses were combined. Within our system of study, the energy-conserving reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway was found to be the most abundant carbon fixation pathway identified in the metagenome. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase genes that have the potential to participate in (1) both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms through the reversible oxidization of CO and subsequent transfer of electrons for sulfate reduction, (2) direct utilization of H-2 and (3) methanogenesis were identified. The most abundant members of the metagenome belonged to Euryarchaeota (22%) and Firmicutes (57%)-by far, the highest relative abundance of Euryarchaeota yet reported from deep fracture fluids in South Africa and one of only five Firmicutes-dominated deep fracture fluids identified in the region. Importantly, by combining the metagenomics data and thermodynamic modeling of this study with previously published isotopic and community composition data from the South African subsurface, we are able to demonstrate that Firmicutes-dominated communities are associated with a particular hydrogeologic environment, specifically the older, more saline and more reducing waters.",
2025,"Mapping of arsenic contamination severity in Bahraich district of Ghagra basin, Uttar Pradesh, India Arsenic testing work has been carried out in Uttar Pradesh by UP Jal Nigam during the period 2005-2008. During this period, arsenic testing was performed using field test kits for 150,000 sources employing screening and blanket testing approach. The current paper describes the work of geographical information system (GIS) mapping in Bahraich district. The district has two physiographic units - Uprahar and Tarhar to depict highland and lowland Quarternary alluvial plains. Out of 30,216 India Mark II hand pumps in the district, arsenic testing was performed, by UP Jal Nigam for 13,812 hand pumps, out of which 7190 (52.06%) tested sources show arsenic value > 0g/L. Further segregation of data shows that 56.66% of affected sources fall in 10-40g/L category and 10.86% sources fall in >50g/L category. Village level mapping of affected sources at GIS platform shows arsenic concentration is more in Huzoorpur and Tajwapur blocks which lie in lowland physiographic unit.",
2026,"Mobility of human populations in the Curi Leuvii basin, Northwest Patagonia, during the Holocene: An approach based on oxygen isotopes The Curi Leuvii basin, in the northwest of Patagonia, had a central role for the indigenous groups that inhabited the region during the Holocene. The area has access to critical resources such as water throughout the year and is near highlands with high carrying capacity during the summer, which has led to hypothesize the establishment of a seasonal pattern of vertical mobility. The presence of several large burial sites along the valleys support the use of the basin as a residential area. Here, we assessed the short and long distance mobility of human populations between 5000 and 200 years BP using oxygen isotopes. We show that delta O-18 terrestrial sources of water display a strong spatial pattern both at regional as well as macro-regional scales, having lower values in the highlands and higher as the altitude and the distance to the Pacific and Atlantic coast decrease. The delta O-18 values of human bone samples from the Curi Leuvii basin are within the range of nearby sources at low and high altitude, suggesting a predominantly regional scale of mobility throughout the Middle-Late Holocene. For future studies remain to be elucidated whether the seasonal displacement between lowlands and highlands, in winter and summer months respectively, involved a logistic or residential mobility.",
2027,"Optimization of Fluidized Roasting Reduction of Low-Grade Pyrolusite Using Biogas Residual as Reductant Research on the novel technology of fluidized roasting reduction of samples of low-grade pyrolusite using biogas residual as reductant has been conducted. According to the response surface design and the analysis of results, orthogonal experiments have been conducted on the major factors, and the effects on the manganese reduction efficiency have been studied. The maximum manganese reduction efficiency could be optimized to nearly 100%, when the mass ratio of biogas residual to pyrolusite was 0.16:1, the dosage of sulfuric acid was 1.6 times that of the stoichiometric amount, the roasting temperature was 680A degrees C, and the roasting time was 70 min. The results in terms of manganese reduction efficiency of the actual experiments were close to those anticipated by modeling the experiments, indicating that the optimum conditions had a high reliability. Other low-grade pyrolusites such as Guangxi pyrolusite (China), Hunan pyrolusite (China), and Guizhou pyrolusite (China) were tested and all these materials responded well, giving nearly 100% manganese reduction efficiency.",
2028,"3D inversion of audio-magnetotelluric data for mineral exploration: A case study of Layikeleke buried porphyry copper deposit, Xinjiang, China Layikeleke copper deposit is a large-scale porphyry copper polymetallic buried deposit, which has been discovered recently in the eastern Junggar area of Xinjiang. Mineralization occurred in the Late Silurian and Early Devonian with the copper body mainly confined to tonalite. To find new ore bodies, it is necessary to map the 3D spatial distribution of the tonalite. For this reason, we deployed audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) sounding in the research area, collected 26 profiles and 1198 measuring points, carried out 3D inversion calculations of off-diagonal elements in the impedance tensor data using the nonlinear conjugate gradient method, and obtained a 3D electrical structure model. The electrical structure reveals two groups of NW-SE trending middle and middle low resistivity anomaly zones, which intersect the high resistivity bedrock area in the northwest of the study area. Based on the electrical data, it can be inferred that the medium low resistance tonalite in the northern part of the study area is the host rock of the porphyry copper polymetallic deposit, which has been verified by borehole data. The results of 3D AMT inversion depict the spatial distribution and depth variation characteristics of the tonalite electrical structure model, providing a basis for further prospecting and exploration. Therefore, this method of identifying lithology by 3D inversion can provide an important basis for mineral exploration and mining of buried rock masses, and is an effective prospecting method.",
2029,"Optimizing the Reduction of Molybdate by Two Novel Thermophilic Bacilli Isolated from Sinai, Egypt The aim of this study was to isolate thermophilic bacteria to be used in in situ bioremediation of molybdate at elevated temperatures. Two molybdate reducing bacteria (Pharon2 and Pharon3) were isolated from the hot Spring at Pharaoh's Bath, Sinai, Egypt. The isolates were identified by 16S rRNA genes sequencing and were submitted to GenBank as Bacillus tequilensis strain Pharon2 (MK078034) and Bacillus sonorensis strain Pharon3 (MK078035). The molybdenum blue production was optimized using multifactorial statistical approaches, Plackett-Burman and central composite designs. According to the results obtained by response optimizer, the maximum molybdenum blue production achieved was 1.04 and 1.12 represented as absorbance at 865Â nm, with the optimum salt concentration of 1.1 and 2.5%; at pH 7.02 and 7.07; incubation temperature of 46.1 and 52.2 Â°C; sucrose and glucose as an electron donor for Bacillus tequilensis strain Pharon2 and Bacillus sonorensis strain Pharon3, respectively. In conclusion, the thermophilic bacterial isolates belonging to the genus Bacillus could be used in in situ bioremediation under elevated temperatures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of molybdenum blue production by thermophilic Bacillus tequilensis and Bacillus sonorensis.",
2030,"The first report of Juglans regia leaf spot cause by Fusarium proliferatum in China Juglans regia is planted widely in China because of its significant economic value as a woody oil species. In August 2019, leaf spots were discovered in a walnut orchard in Tang County, Baoding City, Hebei Province. In the early stages of the disease, irregular brown spots appeared on the edges of leaves, causing them to shrivel; in a later stage, the disease spread inward along the edges to the whole leaves, which then withered. The diseased leaves were collected from the walnut orchard. Select 3-4 mm2 of diseased and healthy junction for each diseased leaf, and the surfaces were sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s and 0.1% HgCl2. The leaves were incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 28 â„ƒ in darkness, each diseased leaf was repeated 10 times, and purified after 6 days. The diameters of the suspected Fusarium isolates reached 8.3 cm, and the aerial mycelia were white to cream and wool-like, later turning violet and dark purple with age. On PDA, the macroconidia exhibited 3-5 septa and were straight or slightly curved, with a size of 21.6-47.4Ã—2.5-4.6 Âµm (average: 31.9Ã—3.5 Âµm, n=50). The morphological features of these fungi were noted to be in line with those of Fusarium proliferatum (Leslie and Summerell, 2006; Zhao et al., 2019). For molecular analysis, DNA was extracted from the mycelium and used the specific primers to amplify the translation elongation factor EF-1Î±, and RNA polymerase II largest-subunit (RPB2) further. The amplicons were sequenced and deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MZ891582, and MZ891583. BLAST analysis revealed that all these sequences showed more than 99% sequence identification with F. proliferatum. We used Fusarium MLST for the identification of this strain and the results showed that EF-1Î± and RPB2 genes have more than 99% similarity with the database F. proliferatum data, with 100% sequence duplication(Deposited of EF-1Î± in GenBank under accession numbers: MH582346, and MH582347; Deposited of RPB2 in GenBank under accession numbers: MH582193, MH582151, MH582196, and MH582172). We created a multigenic tree using Fusarium MLST. Based on the results of the morphology tests and the molecular sequences, the isolates from the diseased leaves were identified as F. proliferatum. To confirm the pathogenicity, healthy walnut leaves of tree planted in pot were inoculated using 50 ÂµL of conidia suspension (1.0Ã—107 CFU) from a pure clone, and those inoculated using only distilled water were taken as controls. All treatments were repeated three times and placed under 28Â°C, RH 100% for 5 days. The inoculated plants showed the same symptoms as those observed in the original diseased plants, while the control plants were asymptomatic. The same fungus was isolated again from the inoculated leaves of tree planted in pot. The re-isolated pathogen from diseased plants was identical to the purified strain used for inoculation, confirmed Koch's postulates. According to the above results, F. proliferatum was identified as the pathogen behind the Juglans regia leaf spots, and it is clearly different from other pathogens, such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It is reported that F. proliferatum can lead to necrotic leaf lesions and the bulb rot of stored onions (Beck et al., 2020), as well as light brown discoloration and dryness on palm leaves and branches (Alananbeh et al., 2021). At the same time, F. proliferatum has been found to have the highest colonization ability on jujube leaves and is becoming a serious pathogen on jujube (Saleh et al., 2016). To our knowledge, this is the first report of walnut leaf spots caused by F. proliferatum in China.",
2031,"New methods of nitrate removal from water Nitrate contamination in groundwater resources originates mainly from the excessive use of fertilisers and uncontrolled land discharges of treated wastewater. This can cause potential health hazards to infants and pregnant women, thus limiting the direct use of the groundwater resources for the human consumption in several parts of the world, including India. The conventional processes used to eliminate nitrate from water are ion exchange, reverse osmosis and electro-dialysis. The utility of these processes has been limited due to their expensive operation and subsequent disposal problem of the generated nitrate waste brine. This paper presents a comprehensive account of the methods/techniques used for the removal of nitrate ion from water during the last 10 years with special reference to the biological denitrification and fate of the metals in decontamination processes.

2032,"Late middle Miocene amphibians and squamate reptiles from Taut, Romania A new Miocene fauna of amphibians and squatnate reptiles from Taut, Arad district, W Romania, is described. The Taut vertebrate locality is of early Sarmatian (late middle Miocene) age, biochronologically belonging to the European Mammal zone MN 7+8. The assemblage of marshy-lacustrine taphonomic context yielded one of the most diverse fauna of amphibians and squamate reptiles ever described from the late middle Miocene of Central and Eastern Europe. The taxonomic account includes at least four species of newts, six species of anurans, four species of lizards, one amphisbaenian and five species of snakes. The salamandrid Carpathotriton and the palaeobatrachid Palaeobatrachus cf. hiri, both with long aquatic phase, represent common taxa with those known from late middle Miocene of Matraszolos, N Hungary, indicating somewhat similar paleoecological conditions. Beside aquatic and periaquatic forms (some newts, Latonia, Palaeobatrachus, Pelophylax, Natrix), other taxa probably inhabited the surrounding terrestrial environments with azonal vegetation (Hyla cf. arborea) and areas covered with scrubs and forests (Geckonidae indet., Ophisaurus sp., Hierophis cf hungaricus, Macrovipera sp.). Pelobates, Blanus cf. gracilis and Scolecophidia indet., were subterranean dwellers. A number of taxa (e.g., Triturus cf marmoratus, Ophisaurus, Blanus cf gracilis) indicate close palaeobiogeographic connections with the western Paratethys and Mediterranean areas. On the other hand, some snakes (e.g., Coronella, Hierophis cf. hungaricus and Macrovipera sp.) appear as Asiatic immigrants. The Taut herpetofauna differs from those of other coeval localities in the area by its abundance in water preferring amphibian groups, by presence of amphisbaenians and by lack of crocodiles as well.",
2033,"Increases in groundwater arsenic concentrations and risk under decadal groundwater withdrawal in the lower reaches of the Yellow River basin, Henan Province, China The spatiotemporal variability in groundwater arsenic concentrations following extensive groundwater extractions over decades was rarely studied on a large scale. To fill this gap, variations in groundwater arsenic concentrations in the North Henan Plain in China from 2010 to 2020 were investigated. The possibility of high-arsenic groundwater (>10Â Î¼g/L) was higher than 40% in aquifers within a distance of 100Â m from paleochannels. This may be due to the fact that deposits in paleochannels were rich in organic matter and suitable for arsenic enrichment. Following groundwater withdrawal over ten years from 2010 to 2020, nearly half of groundwater samples (44%) were elevated in groundwater arsenic concentrations, and the proportion of high arsenic groundwater increased from 24% in 2010 to 26% in 2020. These may be related to enhanced Fe(III) oxide reduction under decadal groundwater withdrawal. However, around 56% groundwater samples were decreases in arsenic concentrations because of increased NO(3)(-) levels in these samples in 2020. Furthermore, extensive groundwater withdrawal decreased groundwater tables averagely by 4.6Â m from 2010 to 2020, which induced the intrusion of high-arsenic groundwater from shallow aquifers into deeper ones. More importantly, the long-term groundwater pumping has perturbed groundwater flow dynamics and redistributed high-arsenic groundwater in the plain, leading to 18% more areas and 33.8% more residents being potentially at risk. This study suggests that the threat of groundwater overexploitation may be much more severe than previously expected.",
2034,"Urinary calcium excretion in healthy Turkish children The aim of this study was to establish the age related reference percentile values for urinary calcium excretion in healthy Turkish children, and to determine the frequency of hypercalciuria and also the factors affecting urinary calcium excretion. A cross-sectional study was performed in Aydin, in western Turkey during winter. Study population was constituted from seventeen districts of this region (sample size was calculated from a formula using the results of the last population census) by stratified and random sampling methods. Urinary calcium excretion was measured as the calcium/creatinine concentration ratio in the second non-fasting urine samples. A total of 2252 children (1132 male) with a mean age of 8.57 +/- 4.44 years (ranged from 15 days to 15 years) were studied. The mean of urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratio was calculated as 0.092 +/- 0.123. The percentile values between 3rd and 97th for urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratio according to age were calculated and shown as multiple line graphs. Hypercalciuria prevalence was found as 9.6% when the upper limit of urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratio was accepted as 0.21. Urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratio of the children from different districts, altitudes, and ethnic origins were statistically different. Poor negative correlations were found between urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratio and age and weight. No differences in urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratios were observed in terms of sexes, diet, physical activity, urolithiasis in the family, symptoms related to hypercalciuria, amount of calcium in drinking water, and urine strip analysis. In conclusion, reference values for urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratios should be established for children in each country and also in each geographic region.",
2035,"Geological, fluid inclusion, and H-O-S-Pb isotopic studies of the Xiaban epithermal gold deposit, Fujian Province, southeast China: Implications for ore genesis and mineral exploration The Xiaban gold deposit is located in the Dehua goldfield of central-eastern Fujian Province, southeast China. Detailed field observations combined with mineral exploration in the study area indicate that the majority of mineralization within the Xiaban gold deposit is hosted by porphyritic rhyolite units in areas proximal to E-W trending faults with lesser amounts located within alteration zones along lithological contacts. The deposit contains silicified banded, disseminated, brecciated, fine-grained stockwork, and quartz-sulfide vein-hosted mineralization, all of which is associated with a quartz-sericite-illite-chalcedony alteration assemblage. The main ore minerals are electrum and pyrite with lesser amounts of galena, Fe-rich sphalerite, and marcasite, all of which are associated with sericitic and argillic alteration as well as silicification. Fluid inclusion microthermometric analysis of quartz-hosted fluid inclusions associated with the main stage of mineralization yielded homogenization temperatures (T-h) of 157-207 degrees C (mean of 180 degrees C) and salinities of 0.7-2.9 wt% NaCl equivalent, which are indicative of an epithermal-type system. The precipitation of gold was most likely caused by fluid mixing between dominant meteoric and minor magmatic fluid components. Fluids within quartz-hosted fluid inclusions have H and O isotopic compositions (delta D-H2O = - 106.3 parts per thousand to - 81.8 parts per thousand; delta(OH2O)-O-18 = -5.8 parts per thousand to -3.0 parts per thousand) that are indicative of ore-forming fluids derived from a meteoric-water-dominated source. Pyrite in the study area has S isotopic compositions that vary between - 2.8 parts per thousand and - 1.6 parts per thousand, indicative of S derived from a homogeneous magmatic source. Lead isotopic compositions of the pyrite within the deposit (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.2953-18.3203, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.6458-15.6502, and Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.6974-38.7271) plot between the orogenic-belt and upper-crustal evolution lines on tectonic discrimination diagrams as well as in the upper-crustal zone of a Delta gamma-Delta beta genetic classification diagram, indicating that Pb within the Xiaban deposit was derived from a homogeneous upper-crustal source. Taken together, these mineralization and alteration, gangue and ore mineral assemblage, fluid inclusion, and H-O-S-Pb isotopic characteristics suggests that the Xiaban gold deposit is a lowsulfidation epithermal deposit This result, together with the inferred minor amount of denudation that has affected the study area, means that the surrounding region should be considered prospective for this style of mineralization, with further exploration for epithermal mineralization within the Dehua goldfield ideally focusing on areas that show similar alteration characteristics to those found in the Xiaban deposit.",
2036,"Activity concentration and dose estimation of Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 and Cs-137 in drinking water of selected areas of Punjab, Pakistan Radioactivity of naturally occurring (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) and anthropogenic (Cs-137) radioactive nuclides wasmeasured in 29 potable ground and surfacewater samples of Punjab, Pakistan. The results showed average activity concentrations for Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 and Cs-137 as 1.09, 0.55, 16.17 and 0.40 Bql(-1), respectively. Cs-137 was detected in only a few samples. The obtained results showed that, in general, activity concentrations of radionuclides (Th-232 and Cs-137) in drinking water samples did not exceed WHO recommendations. Ra-226 in the majority of samples exceeded WHO drinking water guidelines. The estimated committed effective dose due to intake of the water for three age-groups considered (< 1 y, 2-7 y and >= 17 y) was below the ICRP permissible limit (0.1 mSvy(-1)) except for Ra-226 and K-40.",
2037,"Urban landscape management and implications: For greening of urban areas and controlling pollution in context to Indian conditions In the last decade many of the developing countries in Asia have witnessed rapid growth of industrialization and have emerged as economic power house. This express growth in industrialization has lead to unplanned expansion of urban areas by large scale cutting of trees, converting agricultural land for human habitation. This has affected adversely on general environment and maintaining ecological balance. Moreover, in this blind race of growth and development indiscriminative ""mining"" is also identified as another potential threat to environment. Rapid migration and increase in population in the urban areas has also lead to large scale spreading of air and water pollution, garbage etc., and also impairing aesthetic value of area / land. This study was aimed to initiate eco-restoration efforts; rehabilitation of mined out areas; identification and selection of the suitable plant species for afforestation; creating environmental awareness; standardization of horticultural practices with relevance to urban landscape management. Now, it is well accepted that urban greening plays an important role in the social and natural sustainability of a city. An increase of vegetated surfaces in the urban landscape, provide ecological diversity etc. - can help mitigate several negative effects of urbanization on climate, air pollution, since they contribute to the reduction of the structural differences between the urban area and its rural surrounding.",
2038,"Improving neural network for flood forecasting using radar data on the Upper Ping River Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and other data-driven methods are appearing with increasing frequency in the literature for the prediction of water discharge or stage. Unfortunately, many of these data-driven models are used as the forecasting tools only short lead times where unsurprisingly they perform very well. There have not been much documented attempts at predicting floods at longer and more useful lead times for flood warning. In this paper ANNs flood forecasting model are developed for the Upper Ping River, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Raw radar reflectively data are used as the primary inputs and water stage are used as the additional inputs, also four input determination techniques (Correlation, Stepwise regression, combination between Correlation and Stepwise Regression and Genetic algorithms) are applied to select the most appropriated inputs. Normally, the ANNs model can predict up to 6 hours when only water stage used as the input data and the lead time can be increased up to 24 hours by using only radar data. In addition, combination of the input between water stage and radar data, gave the overall result better then using only water stage or radar data, also selecting different appropriated inputs could improve model's performance.",
2039,"Effects of Post-Thinning Precipitation on Soil Acid Phosphomonoesterase Activity in Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. Plantations Soil phosphorus (P) is one of the essential macronutrients for plant growth. Phosphatase-mediated P mineralization in particular is critical for the biogeochemical cycling of P, and its activity reflects the organic P (P-o) mineralization potential in soils. In recent years, global climate change has led to changes in precipitation, which inevitably has affected the P cycle as well. To study these effects of precipitation on soil acid phosphomonoesterase (AcPME) activity, the following combined thinning and precipitation treatments were conducted across Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. plantations in China: control (CK), light (LT), moderate (MT), and high thinning (HT). The precipitation treatments included natural precipitation (NP), 30% reduced precipitation (RP30), and 60% reduced precipitation (RP60). Soil moisture, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and soil P fractions were also determined to link their effects on soil AcPME. The results show that soil AcPME activity was significantly higher in the rainy season, which is associated with higher microbial activity and increased P demand, than in the dry season. Generally, soil AcPME activity was found to increase with thinning intensity. In the dry season, the NP treatment was more conducive to improving soil AcPME activity. In the rainy season, the RP60 treatment inhibited soil AcPME activity under all thinning treatments. The RP30 treatment was only found to offer a significant boost for MT. These results indicate that the potential transformation rate of P-o may be more dependent on water in the dry season than in the rainy season. If drought occurs, the P-o mineralization rate would decrease for all L. principis-rupprechtii plantations, but excessive rainfall in the rainy season would also impact the turnover of P-o into MT adversely.",
2040,"Determination of leaf carbon isotope discrimination in C4 plants under variable N and water supply Understanding the mechanisms underlying variations in carbon isotope discrimination (Î”) in C4 plants is critical for predicting the C3/C4 ratio in C3/C4 mixed grassland. The value of Î” is determined by bundle sheath leakiness (Ð¤) and the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO(2) concentration (C (i) /C (a) ). Leaf nitrogen concentration (N (leaf) ) is considered a driver of Î” in C4 plants. However, little is known about how N (leaf) affects Ð¤ and C (i) /C (a) , and subsequently Î”. Here leaf carbon isotope composition, N (leaf) , Ð¤, and leaf gas exchange were measured in Cleistogenes squarrosa, a dominant C4 species in the Inner Mongolia grassland. Î” remained relatively stable under variable N and water supply. Higher N supply and lower water supply increased N (leaf) , stimulated photosynthesis and further decreased C (i) /C (a) . High N supply increased Ð¤, which responded weakly to water supply. N (leaf) exerted similar effects on C (i) /C (a) and on Ð¤ in the field and pot experiments. Pooling all the data, N (leaf) explained 73% of the variation in C (i) /C (a) . Overall, both Ð¤ and C (i) /C (a) determined Î”; however, the contribution of Ð¤ was stronger. N (leaf) influenced Î” primarily though C (i) /C (a) , rather than Ð¤. Ð¤ should be considered in estimating Î” of C4 endmember.",
2041,"Characterization of underground tunnel water hydrochemical system and uses through multivariate statistical methods: a case study from Maddhapara Granite Mine, Dinajpur, Bangladesh A quality study of the drained water from Maddhapara Granite Mine underground tunnel was undertaken to study their hydrochemical variations and suitability for various uses employing chemical analysis, basic statistics, correlation matrix (r), cluster analysis, principal component/factor analyses, and ANOVA as the multivariate statistical methods. The results of chemical analysis of water show the modest variation in their ionic assemblage among different sampling points of the tunnel where Ca-HCO3 type of hydrochemical facies is principally dominated. The correlation matrix shows a very strong to very weak positive, even negative, correlation relationship, suggesting the influence of different processes such as geochemical, biochemical processes, and multiple anthropogenic sources on controlling the hydrochemical evolution and variations of water in the mine area. Cluster analysis confirms that cluster 1 contains 68.75% of total samples, whereas cluster 2 contains 31.25%. On the whole, the dominated chemical ions of first cluster groups are Ca and HCO3, suggesting a natural process similar to dissolution of carbonate minerals. The second cluster group consisted of Cl- and SO42- ions representing natural and anthropogenic hydrochemical process. The results of PCA/FA analysis illustrate that different processes are involved in controlling the chemical composition of groundwater in the mine area. The factor 1 loadings showed that pH, EC, TDS, Na, Mg, chloride, and sulfate which have high loading in this factor are expected to come from carbonate dissolution to oxidation conditions. One-way ANOVA describes the significance of dependent variables with respect to independent variables. ANOVA gives us the idea that EC, K+, Fe-total, SO42, As, and Pb are the most important factors in controlling spatial differences in water quality in this tunnel. But different results have been encountered for different independent variables which might be due to dissimilar sources of water. From the qualitative analysis, it is clear that water quality is not very favorable for aquatic creatures as well as for drinking purposes. The water can be used for irrigation purposes without any doubt as SAR and RSC analysis provides good results. Moreover, the results of this research confirmed that the application of multivariate statistical analysis methods is apposite to inferring complex water quality data sets with its possible pollution sources. At the end, this research recommends (1) as water becomes more and more important, water treatment plants should be built before the water being used; (2) a detailed water step utilization plan should be set beforehand to guarantee tunnel water being used effectively; and (3) after the water being used for agriculture, elements in crops should be monitored continuously to ensure that ions and compounds that come from the tunnel water are lower than guideline values for human beings health.",
2042,"Leachate risks of fine solid wastes in porous asphalt pavement and runoff purification effects of diatomite filler Solid wastes have been widely applied in porous asphalt pavement, but some of them may contain pollutants. Whether their leachate during rainfall events poses a threat to nearby watersheds has not received enough attention. Based on the laboratory rainfall and infiltrate test, this study evaluated the leachate risks of fine solid wastes in porous asphalt mixture (PA). Based on the runoff pollution characteristics in Shanghai, China, the purification performance of PA with diatomite filler was explored. The results showed that a small amount of Al and Fe in solid waste fillers might infiltrate during intensive rainfall. The diatomite filler could improve pollutants removal rates via physical filtration and selective chemical adsorption effects. The correlations between rainfall characteristics and the removal rates were further developed, which indicated the increase of rainfall time and intensity adversely affected the removal rates. The composition of PA for different runoff pollution characteristics was proposed as well. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2043,"FLOW UNIT CHARACTERISATION IN THE PERMIAN-TRIASSIC CARBONATE RESERVOIR SUCCESSION AT SOUTH PARS GASFIELD, OFFSHORE IRAN The South Pars gasfield (offshore southern Iran) has been investigated in detail in recent studies in terms of depositional, diagenetic and reservoir properties of the Permian-Triassic carbonate succession. In the present paper, a variety of flow unit approaches were applied to identify reservoir (flow) and non-reservoir (baffle or barrier) units within the Permian-Triassic carbonates. The zonation scheme was based on three approaches; (i) flow units were identified using the stratigraphic modified Lorenz plot (SMLP) method; (ii) hydraulic flow units were identified using a parameter known as the flow zone indicator (FZI); and (iii) petrophysical flow units (PFUs) were determined using the pore throat radius (R-35) and water saturation (S-w) parameters. Studies of flow units at both macro-and micro-scales showed that flow properties were controlled by both depositional and diagenetic features. In order to construct a reservoir flow model, the flow units and PFUs were correlated between the four wells studied within a sequence stratigraphic framework. SMLP-derived flow units appeared to be distributed homogenously within the reservoir succession resulting in a layer-cake architecture. By contrast, the FZI-derived hydraulic flow units drew attention to the presence of small-scale heterogeneities within the reservoir. A comparison between these methods showed that the flow model derived from PFUs included greater vertical and horizontal heterogeneities, especially in the Upper Dalan Member (upper K4 reservoir unit). This was due to depositional/diagenetic heterogeneities in both lateral and vertical directions, and the parameters applied in the PFU method. The PFU-derived flow model showed a closer relationship to the actual reservoir performance than the flow units derived by the other methods and can therefore be used as the basis for future dynamic flow simulation.",
2044,"Co-distribution, possible origins, status and potential health risk of trace elements in surface water sources from six major river basins, Bangladesh In this study, we appraised the concentrations of 8 major trace elements (TEs) in surface water sources from six river basins, Bangladesh: Meghna, Kartoya, Sitalakha, Teesta, Pashur and Rupsha River basins. Co-distribution, the status of water quality and potential health risks were assessed using statistical analyses, the entropy water quality index (EWQI), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), spatial autocorrelation index (SAI), hazard index (HI), and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. The spatial variations of TEs concentrations differed notably among the studied river basins. The average concentrations of TEs (except Ni, As, and Zn) in six river basins exceeded the drinking water quality guidelines. About 20% of water samples in six basins were categorized as undrinkable to poor qualities for drinking uses, while good water quality for irrigation purposes. The entropy theory identified that Cr, Pb, and As are the key pollutants influencing the water quality. According to the results of non-carcinogenic risk, the hazard index (HI) values for adults and children surpassed the allowable limit (>1), demonstrating detrimental health effects on humans. The carcinogenic risk values of chromium (Cr) were much higher than As and Cd exposures which exceeded the benchmark recommended by US EPA (>10(-6) to 10(-4)), with an elevated risk for adults than children through the oral intake as the primary exposure route. Overall, the results suggest that the local population exposed to surface water may pose an adverse health effect, thus, strict regulation and efficient management should be focused on Cr, Cd and As monitoring and appraisal in these basins.",
2045,"Silver Nanoparticle-Incorporated Porous Renewable Film as Low-Cost Bactericidal and Antifouling Filter for Point-of-Use Water Disinfection In developing countries, waterborne diseases caused by the pathogenic bacteria are afflicting people who lack access to clean drinking water and live in poor sanitary conditions. User-friendly and low-cost point-of-use (POU) disinfection systems have become the key solution for providing safe drinking water. Herein, a biomass-based renewable film filter with good mechanical strength, porous network structure, and robustly immobilized silver nanoparticles was facilely fabricated via Fe(III) cross-linking-induced collagen fibers (CFs) and gallic acid-protected silver nanoparticle (GA@AgNP) self-assembly. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction were employed to characterize the GA@AgNPs-Fe-CF composite film. This film exhibited both excellent bacterial anti-adhesive and bactericidal activities, which effectively prevented biofouling during the filtration process because of the anionic GA@AgNPs. As the bactericidal filter is driven by gravity, 1 L of the natural water sample was treated by the GA@AgNPs-Fe-CF film for 20 min, and the water quality was in full compliance with the drinking water guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), demonstrating the potential application of the proposed filter in POU water disinfection.

2046,"Fabrication and installation of KSTAR in-vessel control coils The in-vessel control coil (IVCC) system, which has been designed for dedication of various active feedback plasma control functions, successfully fabricated and installed in the vacuum vessel of the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR). The IVCC system consists of sixteen segmented coils that were independently fabricated outside the vacuum vessel and installed without any inside welding or brazing joints. The segmented coil system has several advantages such as eliminating possibility of cooling water leakage at the welded or brazed joints, simplification in fabrication and installation, and easy repair and maintenance of the coil system. Each segment contains eight oxygen-free high conductive coppers, which are grouped to four pairs, called as sections. Consequently, a segmented coil forms four sections for position control, field error correction (FEC), and resistive wall mode (RWM) control in accordance with electrical connection outside the cryostat. The eight conductors (or four sections) with internal coolant holes were enclosed in a rectangular welded jacket made of stainless steel 316LN and electrically insulated from the conductors by epoxy/glass composite layers. This coil system was commissioned up to 5 kA (30 kA-turns) for 5s to achieve tentative use for the fast vertical plasma position control in the 2010 campaign of the KSTAR. This paper describes the several remarkable results in the fabrication and installation of the IVCC as well as commissioning results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2047,"Water and Radiation Use Efficiencies in Drip-irrigated Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.): Response to Full and Deficit Irrigation Regimes Bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L., cv. 'Mercury') response to full and deficit irrigation was studied during the 2005 growing season at Tal Amara research station in the Central Bekaa valley of Lebanon. Treatments were (C) well-watered treatment receiving 100 % of crop evapotranspiration (ET(crop)), and three water-stressed treatments receiving irrigation at 80 (WS(1)), 60 (WS(2)) and 40 % (WS(3)) of ET(crop). Pepper seasonal evapotranspiration varied from a low of 275 mm in the more stressed treatment (WS(3)) to a high of 478 mm in the well irrigated control, while in WS(1) and WS(2) seasonal ET accounted for totals of 427 and 360 mm, respectively. Relative to plants grown in WS(1) treatment (31.9 t ha(-1)), marketable fruit yields of C, WS(2), and WS(3) were reduced by 11.3, 12.2, and 38.2%, respectively. WS(1) and WS(2) treatments enhanced fruit quality (dry matter and total soluble solids contents) compared with C. Water use efficiency at dry yield basis (WUE(y)) of the control was 0.35 kg m(-3) while WS(1), WS(2) and WS(3) treatments had WUE(y) higher by 22, 35 and 39 %, respectively. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) observed in the C and WS(1) treatments (avg. 2.20 g MJ(-1)) was higher by 13 % in comparison to WS(2) and WS(3) treatments (avg. 1.96 g MJ(-1)), with no significant differences between C-WS(1) and WS(2)-WS(3). We concluded that WS(1) treatment is recommended for drip irrigated bell pepper under field conditions in order to obtain higher yield and optimized WUE under the Mediterranean dry climate of the Central Bekaa Valley.",
2048,"Mineral chemistry and H-O-S-Pb isotopic compositions of skarn type copper deposits in the Jiurui district of the Middle-Lower Yangtze River metallogenic belt, Eastern China The skarn type copper deposits are widespread in the Jiurui district in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River metallogenic belt. This paper reports a detailed study on mineral chemistry, and H, O, S and Pb isotopic compositions on skarn silicate and sulfide minerals in the three major skarn dominant deposits (Wushan, Dongleiwan and Dengjiashan). The Wushan skarn deposit is characterized with prograde garnet-dominated and clinopyroxene limited skarns with average andradite content of 83% and hedenbergite content of 10%, whereas the Dongleiwan and Dengjiashan deposits are featured with retrograde skarn alteration with abundant hydrous minerals such as epidote and chlorite. The garnet and clinopyroxene compositions show 59% andradite and 15% hedenbergite for the Dongleiwan skarns, and 43% and 22% for the Dengjiashan skams respectively. The pistacite components (Ps value) defined as Fe3+/(Fe3+ +Al) and Fe3+/Fe2+ value of epidote are 0.12 and 1.63 for the Wushan skarns, 030 and 32.73 for the Dongleiwan skarns, and 0.17 and 42.85 for the Dengjiashan skams. It is suggested that the prograde skarn mineralization in the three deposits was all formed in a relatively oxidizing environment, with the Wushan showing the highest oxidation potential and the Dengjiashan having the least oxidation potential. However, in the retrograde skarns, the Dongleiwan and Dengjiashan deposits show higher oxidation potential than that of Wushan. The three deposits show similar sulfur isotopic compositions of -2.9 to + 1.4 parts per thousand and similar lead isotopic compositions with (206)pb/(204)pb, (207)pb/(204)pb and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios of 17.900 to 18.205, 15.538 to 15.649 and 38.170 to 39.025, respectively. All the three deposits should have similar magmatic origin for the ore-forming materials based on their S and Pb isotopes. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the prograde and retrograde fluids in the three deposits show some differences, with delta O-18(Fluid) values of + 8.13 parts per thousand and + 7.81 parts per thousand for the Wushan, + 6.47 parts per thousand. and + 2.33 parts per thousand for the Dongleiwan, and + 8.27 parts per thousand and + 4.43 parts per thousand for the Dengjiashan. But the hydrogen isotopic compositions are similar for the prograde (-65 to -31 parts per thousand.) and retrograde (-64 to -33 parts per thousand) fluids. Therefore, the fluid origins and evolution may be different in each deposit. The hydrothermal fluids for the prograde skarns in all three deposits were likely derived from magmatic-hydrothermal sources, but the Dongleiwan and Dengjiashan show a higher proportion of meteoric water input in the retrograde stage. Considering the similar average prograde temperatures (574 to 560 degrees C) as calculated from coexisting garnet-clinopyroxene pairs, and similar retrograde temperatures (281 to 246 degrees C) as calculated from chlorite chemistry for the three deposits, we suggest that the trigger for deposition of sulfide ores in the Wushan garnet-dominated skarn deposit was mainly caused by system cooling with temperature drop along with magmatic intrusion and crystallization process. The Dongleiwan and Dengjiashan skarn deposits constitute a well developed retrograde skarn system with abundant epidote, chlorite, quartz and calcite, which probably caused by fluid mixing of high-temperature saline magmatic-hydrothermal fluids with cooler, oxidizing and dilute meteoric water.

2049,"Analysis of pedestrian walking characteristics at vertical facilities in underground train station Kuala Lumpur is the national capital of Malaysia as well as the center of attraction for people looking for jobs. Thus, in the future people will tend to use public transport including the Light Rail Transit (LRT) more often than driving their vehicle. This is especially so due to critical traffic congestion on the road especially during peak hours. The increasing population in Kuala Lumpur could lead the LRT stations to become more crowded form day to day due to excessive demand. Due to this problem, the facilities provided will not be enough and suitable to cater the space demand. Unfortunately, the limited study was done regarding the pedestrian spaces and facilities at underground LRT in Malaysia. Thus, this paper aims to establish the fundamental understanding of pedestrian behavior at vertical facilities in underground train station.",
2050,"Spatial analysis of groundwater quality for drinking purpose in Sirjan Plain, Iran by fuzzy logic in GIS At present, due to shortage of water resources, especially in arid and semiarid areas of the world such as Iran, exploitation of groundwater resources with suitable quality for drinking is of high importance. In this regard, contamination of groundwater resources to heavy metals, especially arsenic, is one of the most important hazards that threaten human health. The present study aims to develop an approach for presenting the groundwater quality of Sirjan city in Kerman Province, based on modern tools of spatial zoning in the GIS environment and a fuzzy approach of evaluating drinking water in accordance with the standards of world health organization (WHO). For this purpose, qualitative data related to 22 exploitation wells recorded during 2002 to 2017 were used. In addition, fuzzy aggregate maps were prepared in two scenarios by neglecting and considering arsenic presence in groundwater resources. The results showed a decrease in groundwater quality over time. More specifically, neglecting the presence of arsenic, in 2002, all drinking wells in the area were located in an excellent zone, while in 2017 a number of operation wells were located in the good and medium zone. Also, the final map, considering the presence of arsenic as a limiting factor of drinking water, indicated that parts of the southern regions of the plain would be the best place to dig wells for drinking water. Therefore, the use of new methods can contribute significantly to the usage of groundwater aquifers and provide a good view of the aquifer water quality.",
2051,"Investigation of Competitive and Noncompetitive Adsorption of Some Heavy Metals Ions on Leucodon sciuroides (Hedw.) SchwÃ¤gr Heavy metals are an important pollutant group. Adsorption is one of the methods used to remove heavy metals from the environment. Mosses were preferred as bio-indicators because they have the capacity to accumulate many elements by their high surface-to-volume ratio. Leucodon sciuroides (Hedw.) SchwÃ¤gr. (LS) are mosses that play an important part of the ecosystem and are collected from the Ida Mountain (Kazdag) region of Ã‡anakkale (Turkey). For the purpose of determining the adsorption capacity of heavy metal ion (Pb(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Cu(2+)) analysis conditions, pH, contact time, and adsorbent amounts were determined and the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated with the help of the relevant isotherms. Heavy metal concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. It was determined that the optimum adsorption for mosses was 30 min at pH = 6.0 (the pH at which maximum adsorption occurs). The adsorption event shows that some divalent cations fit the Freundlich isotherm and some fit the Langmuir isotherm model. A pseudo-second-order reaction best fits the kinetic data for metal ions. Among the six metal ions studied, the highest adsorption was observed in Pb(2+) and Cu(2+) cations. According to the competitive adsorption results, the moss has a great advantage in determining the Pb(2+) and Cu(2+) cations industrially as well as other metals and in removing other metal impurities from the environment. Also, LS is exploited as a biosorbent to remove metal ions from aqueous solutions and can be used as a biomarker.",
2052,"GIS-based spatial multi-criteria approach for characterization and prioritization of micro-watersheds: a case study of semi-arid watershed, South India An assessment of micro-watersheds based on topography and physical processes is always helpful in identifying suitable locations for implementing soil and water conservation measures. The present study was taken up with the objectives of characterization and prioritization of micro-watersheds using GIS-based spatial multi-criteria approach for a case study area of Andipatti watershed. In order to characterize the micro-watersheds, measurements derived from linear, areal, and relief aspects of the stream network were primarily used as indicators of topography and physical processes. To compute a comprehensive value for each micro-watershed, values of morphometric parameters viz., bifurcation ratio (Rb), drainage density (Dd), stream frequency (Fs), drainage texture (Rt), elongation ratio (Re), circularity ratio (Rc), length of overland flow (Lg), and relief ratio (Rh) were used. Further, quantitative estimation of annual average rates of soil erosion (SE) through the RUSLE method and surface runoff (SR) thorough NRSC-CN method was also integrated with micro-watersheds for ranking purposes. To normalize the rankings of each spatially distributed parameter, weights were derived through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Finally, the weighted rankings were summed up and all micro-watersheds are categorized into four priority classes viz. very high, high, moderate, and low. Out of 44 micro-watersheds, 16 micro-watersheds fall under very high priority class signifying the need for watershed conservation measures. Based on the priority index, suitable structural and non-structural measures are suggested to the vulnerable watersheds.",
2053,"Removal of Congo red dye from aqueous solution with nickel-based metal-organic framework/graphene oxide composites prepared by ultrasonic wave-assisted ball milling Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were successfully synthesized by ultrasonic wave-assisted ball milling. In the absence of organic solvent, the coupling effect of ultrasonic wave and mechanical force played an significant role in the synthesis of MOFs. Adsorption of Congo red (CR) was studied in view of adsorption kinetic, isotherm and thermodynamics. The adsorbent was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) methods. It was found that pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich adsorption isotherm matched well for the adsorption of CR onto nickel-based metal-organic framework/graphene oxide composites (Ni-MOF/GO). The results of the adsorption thermodynamics indicated that the adsorption process was a spontaneous and endothermic process. The adsorption capacity of graphene oxide/metal-organic frameworks (GO/MOFs) for CR reached 2489 mg/g, much higher than previous reports. It was demonstrated that an increase in the number of active metal sites can dramatically improve the adsorption capacity of dye. A suitable dry temperature is beneficial for the improvement of adsorption capacity for dye. In this paper, the adsorption results indicated that ultrasonic wave-assisted ball milling has a good prospect for synthesis of MOFs with excellent adsorption performance.",
2054,"The aetiology of adult burns in the Western Cape, South Africa Rural to urban migration to major cities in South Africa continues to lead to the proliferation of informal settlements. There is little recent published data on the epidemiology of adult burns in the Western Cape, South Africa. A retrospective review of patients on the Burn Unit database was undertaken, looking at patients admitted to the Burn Unit between January 2003 and December 2008. This study discusses the characteristics and outcome of patients who were treated at the Tygerburg Burn unit. A total of 1908 patients were admitted to the burn unit during the 6 year period under review. Most fatal injuries occurred in the 20-40 year age group. Injuries due to shack fires and fuel stoves comprised 21% (399) of all admissions. Mortality due to these injuries comprised 28% (137) of total mortality. Gas stoves accounted for 24% with kerosene stoves accounting for 71% of injuries. The burn death rate in this study (25%) was found to have increased dramatically from the last audit done from 1986 to 1995 in which a burn death rate of 7.5% was observed. Reasons for this are explored. It is likely that those with HIV/AIDS have poorer outcomes. Shack fires and injuries due to fuel stoves are a common reason for admission to the burn unit and mostly involve young male individuals. Other research from the Southern African region does not mention shack fires as a separate entity making it difficult to obtain an accurate idea of the scale of the problem. Their injuries are severe with a high mortality. The use of kerosene stoves are a major contributing factor. Recommendations include enforceable legislation to promote safer stove design, research into safer bio fuels and materials for building shacks as well promoting fire safety among schoolchildren in the community. Further research is needed to determine the impact of HIV/AIDS on the outcome of acute burns within the Southern African region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.",
2055,"Physicochemical Assessment of Borehole Water in a Reclaimed Section of Nekede Mechanic Village, Imo State, Nigeria The quality of borehole water in a reclaimed and about to be habited section of the Nekede mechanic village in Imo State, Nigeria, was determined. Five sampling points in this area were chosen for the study. Preliminary characterization of soil at these points using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence method identified leachable heavy metals that can contaminate groundwater. The physical and chemical properties of the borehole water samples were analyzed using standard instrumental methods. The data obtained showed that the water samples were considerably acidic with pH ranging between 5.12 and 5.58. Lead, nickel and phosphate levels in the borehole water samples from all the sampling points were above tolerable limits and ranged between 0.22-0.42 mg/L, 1.03-1.12 mg/L and 0.14-0.34 mg/L respectively. The contamination factor model showed that all the borehole water samples were highly contaminated by lead and nickel, with values ranging between 38.00-42.00 and 14.71-16.00, respectively. The calculated Water Quality Index at all the sampling points gave values between 554.31 and 935.35 and indicated that the water samples were unsuitable for drinking. Constant consumption of borehole water from this area therefore would pose serious health risks to its intending and existing occupants.",
2056,"The shifting sands of land governance in peri-urban Mangaluru, India: fluctuating land as an 'informality machine' reinforcing rapid coastal transformations This article examines how unstable land on a sandy peninsula in peri-urban Mangaluru becomes part of urban land contestation to primarily support continued informal tenure. The peninsula is undergoing shifts changing both its shape and land use under the influence of a range of biophysical and human forces. For the time being, fisherfolk can remain in place despite lacking land documents, but much of the peninsula has been proposed for commercial development projects. The sand-spit thus becomes a frontier for variegated land claims part of urbanization processes where the variable 'nature' of land is enmeshed. Drawing on urban political ecology and Indian land governance literature, the article highlights how the fluctuating land supports continued informality since the shifting sands make boundaries challenging to delimit and maintain, and, once stabilised, can be claimed by the state. The informalising characteristics of land, understood as an 'informality machine', reinforces similar ongoing urban transformations along the entire coastline, to mainly favour elite interests, but can also be seized upon by the fisherfolk themselves for new claims, or workarounds aimed at securing long-term tenure. Future research on the urban land question would do well to include a perspective of land as co-constituted by socionatural processes.",
2057,"Characterization of PM2.5 source profiles from typical biomass burning of maize straw, wheat straw, wood branch, and their processed products (briquette and charcoal) in China Chemical profiles from burning of raw biomass materials (i.e., maize straw, wheat straw and wood branch) and their processed products (i.e., briquette and charcoal) were determined with a customized cleaning stove in a combustion chamber. Inorganic species such as water-soluble ions and elements, and carbonaceous fractions including saccharide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were quantified. Organic carbon (OC) was the highest fraction with a mass contribution to PM(2.5 )ranging from 17.65 +/- 0.15% to 40.17 +/- 3.83%. Potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) were the two most abundant water-soluble ions (4.31 +/- 1.57% and 3.05 +/- 1.29%, respectively). Most elements (e.g., heavy metals) had relatively low fractions ( < 0.01%) or below detection limit. For organics, levoglucosan averagely accounted for over 60% in total quantified saccharides, while 4-ring PAHs was the most dominant fraction. The proportions of OC, sum of quantified PAHs (EPAH5) and levoglucosan, as well as diagnostic ratios such as OC/element carbon (EC), K+/ EC, and sum of quantified saccharides (Sigma saccharides)/PM2.5 showed a characteristic descending order of raw fuels > briquette > charcoal. In comparison, charcoal burning had lower fractions of the organics since most volatile matters and moisture had been removed during carbonization. In addition, the similarities of chemical profiles from different bio-fuels burning were assessed by calculating the coefficient of divergence (CD) and their correlations. Relatively low CD (0.21-0.36) and high correlation (R > 0.97) suggest that the chemical profiles from straw and their briquettes were similar. However, the profiles from charcoal burning showed significant differences between their corresponding raw fuels (CDs = 0.26-0.47, R = 0.69-0.99) and also large variations from each other (CDs = 0.40-0.49, R < 0.90). The results of this study summarize that the processed fuels especially charcoals are unique in source apportionment and inventory studies.",
2058,"Micro-macro linkages in institutional restructuring processes in the water sector: example of the operations management support project (OMS) in Jordan The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) has supported the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) since 1994 by the provision of assistance aimed at increasing the efficiency of the potable water supply and wastewater disposal services under the Operations Management Support (OMS) project. Using OMS as an example, this article shows the links of the change processes at the utility and the sector level (micro-macro linkages) for the introduction of institutional changes within the Jordanian water sector. The support of OMS followed co-evolutionary thinking, that is, it supported the dynamics coming from the utility level and affecting the sector level as well as the feedback loops from sector level to utility level. On the utility level, OMS activities and the induced improvements are a technical base for wider reform processes. They facilitated the implementation of private sector participation, PSP, with better quality base data. The information systems which were introduced by the project also indicated the importance of structural changes on the sector level and the urgency of these reforms. And finally, the involvement of OMS staff on the utility level made them credible when offering advice about the sector level. Hence, the parallel support of activities on both levels provided a deeper awareness of the reform issues and contributed to the success of the sector reforms.",
2059,"Determination of Lead in Water Samples by GFAAS after Collection on Montmorillonite with Slurry Introduction In this study, a highly accurate, fast and practical separation/enrichment technique is described to determine the Pb in tap water samples by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. For this purpose, at first, Pb was collected on montmorillonite by batch technique, the supernatant was decanted and the solid phase was slurried in a mixture of 0.1% Triton X-114 and 0.1 mol L-1 HNO3 then directly introduced into graphite furnace without elution. Since the elution step was not applied, the method was simpler and faster compared to conventional techniques. The risks of elution step on the precision and recovery were eliminated. Up to 50-fold enrichment could be obtained by this method. The limit of detection (3 delta, N = 10) and characteristic concentration of the method for Pb were 0.46 and 1.13 mu g L-1, respectively. In addition, the Pb in water samples (tap and river) collected from different regions of Turkey were determined.",
2060,"Calcutta's industrial pollution: Groundwater arsenic contamination in a residential area and sufferings of people due to industrial effluent discharge - An eight-year study report An industry was producing 20-30 tons of Parin Green [Copper acetoarsenite (Cu(CH3COO)(2)3Cu(AsO2)] per year and was discharging most of the effluent without proper treatment in an open land just outside the boundary of the factory. Due to the high porosity of the soil, arsenic percolated and contaminated the underground aquifer. More than 7000 people living around the discharge point, were exposed posed to arsenic contaminated water. Primary investigations and follow-up studies in the area, carried out for the last 8 years, have revealed that some effluent the distant tubewells which were earlier free from arsenic, are getting contaminated now. In May 1997, a preliminary analysis of arsenic in the urine, hair and nails of some of the people drinking contaminated water from CMC deep tubewells indicated higher arsenic concentration than in the normal population.",
2061,"Health risk assessment of phreatic water based on triangular fuzzy theory in Yinchuan plain Groundwater quality relating closely to human health has become a great concern to the whole society, especially in heavily polluted areas. Yinchuan Plain, located in the arid and semi-arid region of Northwestern China, where people rely heavily on groundwater resource. However, due to the improper groundwater exploitation and negative effect of human activities in recent years, groundwater quality in Yinchuan plain become deteriorated. For the sustainable utilization and protection of groundwater resources, health risk assessment (HRA) of phreatic water is conducted in this paper. On the basis of model recommended by EPA, triangular fuzzy number is applied to establish risk assessment model for health risk assessment of adults and children in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Results of HRA indicate that carcinogenic risk of arsenic is highest among the risk from components in phreatic water, and the highest risk from arsenic to adults and children in wet and dry season are 6.48â€¯Ã—â€¯10(-6)a(-1) and 9.56â€¯Ã—â€¯10(-6)a(-1), 1.08â€¯Ã—â€¯10(-5)a(-1) and 1.59â€¯Ã—â€¯10(-5)a(-1), respectively. This study also states that in Yinchuan Plain carcinogenic risk from drinking groundwater can be 3-4 times magnitude higher than the noncarcinogenic risk. Also it is found that the health risk to children is as 1.5-2 times as to adults, while the uncertainties of adults' health risk are higher than that of children.",
2062,"Assessment of soil phosphorus availability to corn In order to evaluate soil phosphorus availability to plants, the extraction methods: Mehlich-1, exchange resins in beads (RE), encapsulated (RC) and as membrane (RM) and iron oxide impregnated filter papers with 75% field capacity (D1) and waterlogged conditions (D2) were studied in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, in 1994, in a greenhouse experiment with six soils fertilized with four phosphate rates and cultivated with corn (Zea mays L.) for 28 days. Determination coefficients between plant absorbed phosphorus and the amounts determined by the extraction methods were: 0.85 (Mehlich-1), 0.82 (RE), 0.84 (RC), 0.89 (RM), 0.75 (D1) and 0.70 (D2). Soil phosphorus contents extracted by the exchange resin methods were highly correlated (r = 0.98), as well as with the amounts extracted by the D-l method (r = 0.89). The results indicated that the studied methods are equally effective for predicting P availability to the corn plants.",
2063,"Impact of Heavy Metal Pollution on Ammonia Oxidizers in Soils in the Vicinity of a Tailings Dam, Baotou, China Soil heavy metal pollution has received increasing attention due to their toxicity to soil microorganisms. We have analyzed the effects of heavy metal pollution on ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in soils in the vicinity of a tailings dam of Baotou region, China. Results showed that AOB were dominated with Nitrosomonas-like clusters, while AOA was dominated by group1.1b (Nitrososphaera cluster). Single Cd and Cr contents, as well as compound heavy metal pollution levels, had a significant negative impact on soil potential nitrification rate and both diversities of AOA and AOB. No clear relationship was found between any single heavy metal and abundance of AOA or AOB. But compound pollution could significantly decrease AOA abundance. The results indicated that heavy metal pollution had an obviously deleterious effect on the abundance, diversity, activity and composition of ammonia oxidizers in natural soils.",
2064,"SAFETY EVALUATION OF RURAL DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN NANG COUNTY, TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION OF CHINA This paper evaluates the quality of drinking water sources of 9 villages in Nang County, Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China using the water quality index (WQI) model of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), and verifies the evaluation results by the comprehensive pollutant index (CPI) method. The results show that CCME WQI and CPI have outputted similar rankings, and the results of the two methods have high Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This means CCME WQI is a feasible way to evaluate the safety of rural drinking water sources. CCME WQI evaluation shows that the water qualities in the 9 villages satisfy the requirements on drinking water.",
2065,"STRONTIUM ISOTOPIC VARIATIONS OF NEOPROTEROZOIC SEAWATER - IMPLICATIONS FOR CRUSTAL EVOLUTION We report high precision Sr isotopic data on carbonates from the Neoproterozoic Shaler Group, Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Lithostratigraphic correlations with the relatively well-dated Mackenzie Mountains Supergroup constrain Shaler deposition to approximately 770-880 Ma, a range corroborated by 723 +/- 3 Ma lavas that disconformably overlie Shaler carbonates and by Late Riphean microfossils within the section. Samples with low Rb-87/Sr-86 ratios (< 0.01) were selected for Sr isotopic analysis. delta-O-18, Mn, Ca, Mg, and Sr data were used to recognize altered samples. The altered samples are characterized by high Mn/Sr (greater-than-or-equal-to 2) and variable delta-O-18; most are dolomites. The data indicate that between ca. 790-850 Ma the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of seawater varued between 0.70676 and 0.70561. The samples show smooth and systematic variation, with the lowest Sr-87/Sr-86 value of 0.70561 at ca. 830 Ma. The low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of carbonates from the lower parts of our section is similar to a value reported for one sample from the Adrar of Mauritania (almost-equal-to 900 Ma), West African Craton. Isotopic ratios from the upper part of the Shaler section are identical to values from the lower part of the Neoproterozoic Akademikerbreen Group, Spitsbergen. Although a paucity of absolute age determinations hinders attempts at the precise correlation of Neoproterozoic successions, it is possible to draw a broad outline of the Sr isotopic composition of seawater for this period. Indeed, the Sr isotope data themselves provide a stratigraphic tool of considerable potential. Data from this study and the literature are used to construct a curve of the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of Neoproterozoic seawater. The new data reported in this study substantially improve the isotopic record of Sr in seawater for the period 790-850 Ma. The Sr isotope composition of seawater reflects primarily the balance between continental Sr input through river input and mantle input via hydrothermal circulation of seawater through mid-ocean ridges. Coupling of Nd and Sr isotopic systems allows us to model changes in seafloor spreading rates (or hydrothermal flux) and continental erosion. The Sr hydrothermal flux and the erosion rate (relative to present-day value) are modeled for the period 500-900 Ma. The results indicate that the hydrothermal flux reached a maximum value at ca. 830 Ma. In contrast, a large peak in erosion rate is indicated at ca. 570 Ma. The peaks in hydrothermal flux and erosion rate are most likely related to developments in the Pan-African and related orogenic events, whose initial development is characterized by production of juvenile crust during supercontinental break up and rifting. The time ca. 570 Ma is characterized by continent-continent collision and production of recycled crust. Sr isotope data from Proterozoic carbonates offer a valuable resource for understanding large-scale crust dynamics.",
2066,"Association of Physicochemical Characteristics, Aggregate Indices, Major Ions, and Trace Elements in Developing Groundwater Quality Index (GWQI) in Agricultural Area The aim of this study was to propose a groundwater quality index (GWQI) that presents water quality data as a single number and represents the water quality level. The development of the GWQI in agricultural areas is vital as the groundwater considered as an alternative water source for domestic purposes. The insufficiency of the groundwater quality standard in Malaysia revealed the importance of the GWQI development in determining the quality of groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from thirteen groundwater wells in the Northern Kuala Langat and the Southern Kuala Langat regions from February 2018 to January 2019. Thirty-four parameters that embodied physicochemical characteristics, aggregate indicator, major ions, and trace elements were considered in the development of the GWQI. Multivariate analysis has been used to finalize the important parameters by using principal component analysis (PCA). Notably, seven parameters-electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium, and chloride were chosen to evaluate the quality of groundwater. The GWQI was then verified by comparing the groundwater quality in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. A sensitivity analysis was performed on this index to verify its reliability. The sensitivity GWQI has been analyzed and showed high sensitivity to any changes of the pollutant parameters. The development of GWQI should be beneficial to the public, practitioners, and industries. From another angle, this index can help to detect any form of pollution which ultimately could be minimized by controlling the sources of pollutants.",
2067,"Linking leaf-level morphological and physiological plasticity to seedling survival and growth of introduced Canadian sugar maple to elevated precipitation under warming Global climate change will lead to new combinations of temperature and precipitation patterns. Extreme precipitation events will become more common by the late 21' century due to anthropogenic warming, particularly in high latitudes; however, the specific responses of high latitude species are mostly unknown. We employed an introduction trial by transplanting temperate sugar maples (Acer saccharum Marsh) from three provenances of their native ranges within Canada, which had a mean annual temperature (MAT) ranging from 3.0 to 9.4 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 520 to 1190 mm. These maples were transplanted to four sites in subtropical China with a MAT of 15.8-16.2 degrees C and a MAP of 913 mm, 1001 mm, 1172 mm, 1490 mm, respectively. We measured the survival and growth of the first-year seedlings of all provenances, as well as the survival, growth, and leaf morphological and physiological traits of the seedlings of Ontario provenance after four years of acclimation. We found that the first-year survival and growth of all provenances increased with the MAP at the planting sites, peaked at 1172 mm, and then decreased at the 1490 mm MAP site, with the seedlings of Ontario provenance had the best overall survival and growth rates across all of the sites. At the end of the 4th growing season, the seedlings of the Quebec and Manitoba provenances died off, and the survival- and growth-MAP relationships of the Ontario provenance mirrored those observed in the first year. For the Ontario provenance at year 4, the major vein density, stomatal density and size, and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) changed significantly with MAP at the introduced sites. Principal component analysis indicated that seedling survival was negatively associated with stomatal size, density and starch content and that growth was positively related to leaf major vein density and negatively to soluble sugar and NSC. Our results indicate that changes in the precipitation range determined the performance of introduced sugar maple at the introduced sites. A moderate increase in precipitation was observed to ameliorate heat stress and benefit plant growth; however, excessive water could result in a fatal effect. Moreover, our findings suggest that the plasticity of leaf morphological and physiological traits influenced the survival and growth of the introduced sugar maple under future precipitation and warming.",
2068,"Design and analysis of a hybrid air and water cooler In this paper we have discussed the utilization of a desert cooler for cooling air as well as water. Hot water is allowed to flow inside a copper coil immersed in the desert cooler tank; in this process the hot water gets cooled. We have developed a model to predict the performance of the device as an air cooler cum water cooler. This model has been experimentally validated. We have computed the performance for hot and dry climate of Jodhpur, India (26.2389 degrees N, 73.0243 degrees E). It is seen that the cooler is performing very well in hot and dry climate; Maximum depression in temperature of hot water is 17.8 degrees C for the month of May. The average depression is 12.6 degrees C, 12.9 degrees C and 8.6 degrees C April, May and June. For heat transfer we have considered a copper tube of length 15 m and diameter 0.012 m. The total thermal energy extracted from hot water for summer months (April, May, June) is 1442.3 kWh, and the cost of thermal energy extracted is Rs 0.32/kWh (US$ 0.0049/kWh). The cost of extracting heat by using the proposed method is about 88% less than the cost to extract same quantity of heat using electricity. (C) 2019 Karabuk University.

2069,"Influence of abnormal water intake linked to underwater aeration on ceramic membrane fouling in a drinking water treatment plant in Yeoncho, Korea This study investigated the fouling of ceramic membranes, which led to an increase in the transmembrane pressure (TMP) in a drinking water treatment plant in Yeoncho, Korea. The TMP values of the ceramic membranes monitored from 2014 to 2018 ranged from 0.01 to 2.12 kg f cm(-2) (average TMP = 0.61 kg f cm(-2)). The TMP values fluctuated significantly, and considerable differences were found for each ceramic membrane module. A high TMP value (>1.5 kg f cm(-2)), the criterion for clean-in-place, was frequently observed, and its duration was prolonged. In addition, the TMP values remarkably increased when the water level in the reservoir decreased after increasing and when the underwater aeration within the reservoir was activated. The TMP was also related to the depth of the water intake. Comprehensive analyses of the fouled ceramic membranes revealed that organic matter, microalgae (e.g., diatom frustule), aluminum, manganese, and silica were the main components of the membrane foulants (organic material content = 48.5%; inorganic material content = 51.5%). Thus, a large proportion of the source material in the reservoir strongly contributed to the fouling of the ceramic membranes. To comprehensively explore the behavior of foulants in the reservoir and alleviate membrane fouling, minimizing artificial disturbances in the water body in the reservoir in terms of raw water management was necessary. In particular, semi-enclosed medium-sized reservoirs that supply raw water to the membrane filtration process for producing drinking water are more vulnerable to membrane fouling.",
2070,"Hydrogeochemistry of the Chiang Mai Basin, northern Thailand Chemical composition of groundwater samples collected from 247 boreholes throughout the Chiang Mai Basin was determined in order to describe the background ion concentrations and to identify the major hydrogeochemical processes that control the observed water chemistry. The investigation results indicate that the groundwater is generally free from heavy metals although exceptionally high Fe, Mn, F and Na are found locally. The groundwater of the Chiang Mai Basin has evolved chemically through water-rock interactions from low TDI and low pH meteoric water recharges principally at basin rims towards higher TDI and pH groundwaters discharges mainly along the through-flowing Mae Ping River. The average groundwater has hydrochemical facies either of Ca-Na or Na-Ca bicarbonate type with neutral pH and total dissolved ions (TDI) of about 10 meg/l.

2071,"Restoration challenges for urban rivers Urban sources account for significant quantities of important diffuse pollutants, and urban watercourses are typically badly polluted. As well as toxic metals, hydrocarbons including PAHs, and suspended matter, priority urban pollutants include faecal pathogens and nutrients. Can urban watercourses be restored by sufficient reductions in pollution loads? Case studies in the UK and Sweden provide insights and some grounds for optimism. A major trans-Atlantic review of the performance of best management practices (BMPs) is informing BMP planning. New approaches such as the maximisation of self-purification capacity in the receiving waters may also need to be developed, alongside BMPs at source. Other initiatives in Europe, USA and China, including collaborative projects, are trying to address the intractable issues such as persistent pollutants from transport and urban infrastructure. The challenge is daunting, but there are clear ways forward and future research needs are evident.",
2072,"Spatio-temporal characterization of arsenic distribution in a karst aquifer in the south of the State of Mexico Diversity of anthropogenic, geological and climatic factors are related to the conformation of the physicochemical properties of groundwater in a specific area, which should be studied using appropriate approaches. To achieve this, the main objective of this research was aimed at assessing the current situation of the resource emphasizing the individualization of the main factors that determine its temporal-space evolution in the municipalities of Ixtapan de la Sal and Tonatico. The methodological approach used consisted of a combination of hydrochemical, multivariate statistical and geostatistical analysis techniques, applied to the physicochemical parameters measured in thermal, non-thermal, surface sources and wells. For 2015 and 2019, the results show that two types of water predominate: Ca2+-HCO3- and Na+-Cl-. A third group, Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl-, evidences mixing processes between thermal and non-thermal waters. Additionally, the dissolution of halite, carbonate minerals (dolomite and calcite) and magnesium sulfate is predominant in the majority ionic conformation. Principal components analysis confirms two important processes: (1) salinity and (2) alkalinity, related to geogenic and anthropogenic factors. The geostatistical modeling, carried out by ordinary kriging, shows that water quality decreases in a south-west to north-east direction, involving arsenic as the main quality limitation factor. It can be concluded that a combined approach, which includes hydrochemical analysis and statistical techniques, offers a viable alternative for the study of the physicochemical evolution of groundwater, the implementation of which can be extrapolated to aquifers of a similar nature.",
2073,"Deriving the aquatic predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) of three chlorophenols for the Taihu Lake, China The Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) is a key for ecological risk assessment. In this paper, the aquatic species existing widely in the Taihu Lake were selected, and their toxicity data to 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were collected. The PNECs of 2,4-DCP; 2,4,6-TCP; and PCP were derived using three different approaches, i.e., the assessment factor (AF), species sensitivity distribution (SSD) as well as an eco-toxicological model (AQUATOX). As the results, PNEC(AF)s were 2.18 Î¼g L(-1), 2.53 Î¼g L(-1) and 0.26 Î¼g L(-1), and PNEC(SSD)s were 77 Î¼g L(-1), 197 Î¼g L(-1) and 10 Î¼g L(-1), respectively for 2,4-DCP; 2,4,6-TCP; and PCP respectively. Based on the aquatic conditions of the Taihu Lake, the derived site-specific PNEC(AQUATOX)s were 15 Î¼g L(-1), 67 Î¼g L(-1) and 4 Î¼g L(-1), respectively. In general, the PNECs for three chlorophenols derived from different approaches followed the declined order of PNEC(SSD) > PNEC(AQUATOX) > PNEC(AF). The ratios of PNEC(AF) to PNEC(SSD) and PNEC(AQUATOX) to PNEC(SSD) for three chlorophenols were 0.013-0.028 and 0.19-0.4, respectively. It indicated that PNECs obtained using different approaches may vary and the one based on the AF was the lowest. Therefore, PNEC(AF) can be seen as overprotective. The PNEC(AQUATOX) values for three chlorophenols were less than the corresponding PNEC(SSD) values, mostly because the indirect effects were considered in the ecological model.",
2074,"The applicability and limitations of thermodynamic geochemical models to simulate trace element behaviour in natural waters. Lessons learned from natural analogue studies Natural analogue investigations aim to understand key phenomena and processes in natural systems related to those expected to occur in radioactive waste repositories. One of the key applications of natural analogue studies has been the possibility to test the geochemical models to be used to describe the migration of radionuclides in a future radioactive waste repository system. To this end, several geochemical modelling testing exercises (commonly denoted as blind predictive modelling, BPM) have formed an integral part of these studies over the last decade. We have reviewed, discussed and compared the results obtained from geochemical modelling BPM exercises carried out within six natural analogue studies: Pocos de Caldas, Cigar Lake, Maqarin, El Berrocal, Oklo and Palmottu. To make this comparison meaningful, we present the main geochemical characteristics of each site in order to highlight the most relevant mineralogical and hydrochemical differences. The elements selected for discussion are: Sr, Ba, Sn, Pb, Se, Ni, Zn, REEs, Th and U. We have based our discussion on the results obtained from the calculated aqueous speciation as well as by comparing solubility calculations with the actually observed concentrations. Results can be differentiated into two categories of elemental behaviour: 1. those elements Re Th and U under reducing conditions that can be fairly well described by assuming solubility control exerted by pure solid phases as their oxyhydroxides; 2. elements such as Sr, Zn, REEs and U under oxidising conditions for which the association to major geochemical components of the system must be considered in order to explain their concentrations in groundwaters. Additionally, we discuss the main improvements made to the thermodynamic databases and the geochemical calculation methodologies due to the BPM exercises.

2075,"Problems of groundwater quality related to the urban environment in Greater Cairo Greater Cairo is faced with increases in population and unplanned extensions in urbanization. This has not been followed by an equal expansion in water supply and sanitary drainage, thus resulting in poor environmental conditions. Cairo covers 300 km(2) with intensive and varied urban land uses and encompasses the oldest industrial areas of Egypt, such as Shubra-Mostorad and Helwan. In addition, new industrial communities are located in the western desert fringe of Greater Cairo with many industrial areas located in zones of highly vulnerable groundwater. Pollution sources of industrial origin threatening groundwater occur in a wide variety of both large and small industrial areas. Moreover the desert fringes of Cairo are being reclaimed by using sewage (waste) water for irrigation. The adverse environmental impacts of unplanned urban expansion and industrial and agricultural activities could lead to deterioration in groundwater quality. This has dictated quick interventions based on groundwater quality monitoring systems designed to detect pollution sources and their spatial extension. This paper presents groundwater quality indicators for domestic, agricultural and industrial pollution at representative sites within Greater Cairo.",
2076,"Groundwater Arsenic Contamination, Its Health Effects and Approach for Mitigation in West Bengal, India and Bangladesh Since 1988, water samples from 140,150 tube-wells were analyzed for arsenic (As) in all 19 districts of West Bengal. In 9 districts, As has been found above the national standard (50 mu g/L) and in 5 districts, between 10 and 50 mu g/L. From Bangladesh, 50,515 tube-well water samples were analyzed from all 64 districts. Arsenic was present above 10 mu g/L in 60 districts and in 50 districts, above 50 mu g/L. Other than urine As speciation, 39,000 biological samples were analyzed from both patients and non-patients, 83% of the samples had As above normal level. Arsenical skin lesions were identified in 13,118 people, screening 114,841 from West Bengal and Bangladesh. About 6.1% of 5,000 children in Bangladesh and 1.7% of 14,000 in West Bengal were found to have arsenical skin lesions. Arsenic neuropathy, obstetric outcome and As in foodstuffs were also studied. Proper watershed management and community participation are needed to mitigate this alarming situation.",
2077,"Risk assessment of uranium in selected gold mining areas in South Africa Real and perceived risks due to gold and uranium mining in the West Rand and Far West Rand goldfields of South Africa have led to intense and sometimes heated public debate. In this context, it is critical to present results of such investigations carefully in a neutral format. The format for reporting in the current study was that of a Tier-II risk assessment, as routinely implemented by the US EPA. Sources, release and fate and transport mechanisms have been investigated and integrated with identified pathways to the local communities. An unacceptable level of risk has been identified, primarily due to the chemical toxicity of uranium on ingestion via drinking water.",
2078,"Modeling spring-summer phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan with and without riverine nutrient loading There were two phytoplankton blooms captured by remote sensing in Lake Michigan in 1998, one from March to May, and one during June. In this paper, those phytoplankton blooms were simulated by a coupled physical-biological model, driven by observed meteorological forcing in 1998. The model reasonably reproduced the lake currents. The biological model results, with and without riverine nutrient loading, were compared with the remote sensing data. A 3-month-long donut-like phytoplankton bloom that appeared in southern Lake Michigan was reasonably well simulated only when riverine input was included, indicating the importance of riverine nutrient input for supporting the growth of phytoplankton in Lake Michigan. The model with riverine input also captured a second event-driven phytoplankton bloom during June with weaker magnitude that occurred in mid-south Lake Michigan, which lasted for about 20 days. The major reason for the weaker bloom in June was that vertical mixing in the hydrodynamic model was too weak (leading to a mixed-layer depth of 20 m) to bring the bottom nutrient-rich water up to the epilimnion. High chlorophyll concentration that persisted in Green Bay for almost a year was simulated with less intensity.",
2079,"HYDROCHEMICAL AND GASEOUS ANOMALIES ON SULFIDE TAILINGS (SALAIR, KEMEROVO REGION) The relevance of the research consists in obtaining data on the processes occurring in the sulfide mine waste, their transformation under the influence of oxidative factors, migration of toxic components into the environment. The main aim of the research is to determine the vertical zoning by elemental composition and content of gases (carbon disulfide and dimethyl sulfide) in the tailings, as well as to establish the hydrochemical anomalies in the nearest river as a result of migration of potentially toxic elements with water flows from the tailings. Object of the research is the abandoned tailings dump of the Salair mining and processing plant - Talmovskie Peski (Salair, Kemerovo region), containing wastes of cyanidation and flotation of barite-polymetallic ores. Methods. In the field, thermometry, gas analysis, electric exploration by the resistance method in the electrotomography mode were carried out. Solid and liquid sampling was carried out in accordance with generally accepted techniques. The laboratory study of the chemical composition was carried out by the methods of conductometry, potentiometry, capillary electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. Results. The vertical distribution of the total element concentrations is determined by the heterogeneity of the stored tailings material. Using the example of two cross sections to a depth of 1,2 m, it was determined that the humidity of the substance increases with depth, and the temperature, pH pastes and aqueous extracts decrease. With depth, the amount of water-soluble species of metals increases due to the transformation of sulfides in acidic conditions, as well as due to the inflow from the upper horizons. The gas generation of carbon disulfide and dimethyl sulfide increases towards the upper layers of the tailings, which is due to the both transformation of minerals, and active functioning of biota in the upper heated layers with a neutral reaction of the medium. As a result of active tailings-water-gas interactions, contrasting hydrochemical anomalies with high metal concentrations are formed in the Malaya Talmovaya River, in the channel of which the tailing dump is located.",
2080,"Changes in the antioxidant intensities of seven different soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cultivars during drought Drought stress-induced antioxidative defense responses were studied in seven soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) cultivars PUSA 9712, LSB 1, JS 335, ADB 22, NRC 37, DSB 20, and MAUS 61, respectively. Drought stress was imposed by withholding irrigation till the leaf water potentials reached -1.0, -1.5, and -2.0 MPa. Lipid peroxidation and superoxide, H2O2, (OH)-O-center dot, DPPH radical scavenging assays were performed. Antioxidants during drought stress were studied by quantifying the ascorbic acid, glutathione, alpha-tocopherol, phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. Antioxidant levels were significantly high in soybean foliages exposed to drought with the increased concentrations of radicals and enhanced lipid peroxidation rates. Isoenzyme analysis of SOD has shown the upregulation of Cu/Zn and MnSODs. Our results demonstrate that cultivars PUSA 9712 and LSB1 have shown to possess a high rate of antioxidants and a very efficient antioxidative defense system when compared with other cultivars. Practical applications Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is an economically important cash crop, cultivated globally for its rich protein, oil, nutraceutical, and antioxidant constituents. It is also cultivated for its rich enriched food, animal feed as well as several other commercial products. In India, most of the soybean cultivation is being done under rainfed conditions. Hence, identification of superior soybean cultivars rich in antioxidants is very important. The work presented here is the output of the investigation carried out on cramming the changes in antioxidative defense mechanisms of seven popular soybean cultivars that are regularly cultivated in India. A study was performed by quantifying the radicals, H2O2 concentrations, lipid peroxidation, determination of enzymatic, and nonenzymatic antioxidants in all selected soybean cultivars exposed to control and increased the duration of drought stress, for the identification of superior cultivars with a rich avenue of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.",
2081,"Maternal and fetal blood lead concentrations under non-occupational lead exposure and associated factors in Pakistan This study in selected Pakistani populations was conducted to determine the blood lead levels (BLL) in mothers and their developing fetuses. Associated factors were correlated with the maternal BLL. Blood samples from 113 pregnant women and their umbilical cords were examined for BLL and cord blood lead levels through a graphite furnace-attached atomic absorption spectrophotometer. A structured questionnaire was also used to obtain sociodemographic and obstetric data based on basic demographic data, reproductive history, hemoglobin levels, gestational age, parity, mode of delivery, maternal and baby weight, drinking water, menarche age, blood pressure, lead (Pb)-containing eye liner use, smoking, and nutritional status. In order to assess the strength of the relationship between different parameters, Pearson's coefficient correlation was utilized and their significance was determined by applying the t-test. Data demonstrated that the maternal BLL were always higher than the recommended concentrations of 10 mu g/dl and many factors contributed towards such results. Drinking water seemed to affect the Pb concentration as women using spring water had relatively higher BLL. The calcium concentration in pregnant women and their fetuses ranged from 9 to 13 mg/dl. Majority of the pregnant women were undergraduates with 12 years of education (equivalent to high school in the United States). Evidence indicates that the avoidance of Pb intake and its associated factors in the study area will diminish risk to newborns.",
2082,"Application of water quality index and chemometric methods on contamination assessment in the shallow aquifer, Ganges River basin, India Water quality index and chemometric methods were employed to assess the groundwater quality and contamination sources in the upper Ganges basin (UGB) and lower Ganges basin (LGB) as groundwater is a sole source for drinking, domestic and agricultural uses. Groundwater samples were collected from UGB (n = 44) and LGB (n = 26) and analysed for physicochemical parameters. Groundwater in this basin is desirable (51%) to permissible (TDS < 1000 mg/l, 96%) classes for drinking. Chemical constituents in the groundwater are lower than the maximum allowable limit recommended by the WHO for drinking except K. Drinking water quality index (DWQI) values reveal that groundwater belongs to excellent (89%) and good (10%) classes. However, the high concentrations of Fe and Mn in 61 and 77% of samples, respectively, restrict the usage for drinking according to USEPA recommendations. Both LGB and UGB groundwater in shallow wells have elevated concentration of TDS, EC and other ions (Ca2+, Cl- and SO42- in LGB; major ions, NO3-, PO43-, F-, Fe and Mn in UGB) and imply the influences of anthropogenic activities. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis reiterated that groundwater quality is affected by the anthropogenic activities as well as mineral dissolutions (carbonate and silicate minerals). This study highlighted that the infiltration of wastewater from various contamination sources likely triggered the dissolution of the minerals in the vadose zone that resulted in the accumulation of ions in the shallow aquifer. An effective management plan is essential to protect this shallow aquifer.",
2083,"GREEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN GHANA: A REVIEW Market-led strategies for growth and development have resulted in negative externalities at the various stages of production and consumption cycle, leading to the destruction of the environment, with negative consequences for sustainable development. Prior to the emergence of sustainable development, economic development, which was geared more towards economic growth paid less attention to externalities. Since 1983, vibrant and competitive private sector; and entrepreneurship approaches have been tapped in Ghana for the creation of jobs and employment. These, coupled with other factors, transitioned the country to middle-income status in 2011. The undue focus on a competitive private sector without prudent practices of sustainability has led to over exploitation and use of natural resources and this has caused deforestation, land degradation, air and water pollution, soil erosion, overgrazing and destruction of bio-diversity. These effects are estimated to cost about 10% of the country's GDP annually. Green entrepreneurship is very vital for addressing these challenges and the eradication of poverty. Using a desk study approach, this paper assesses how Ghana can harness the innovative potentials of green entrepreneurship to foster the attainment of sustainable development.",
2084,"Estimating groundwater resource and understanding recharge processes in the rapidly urbanizing Dhaka City, Bangladesh Rapid urbanisation in Dhaka (Bangladesh) with high dependency on the groundwater have recently raised concern over the sustainability of the aquifers. The present study focusses on quantifying the dynamic groundwater resource vis-a-vis the status of groundwater development and understanding the different recharge processes in the Dhaka City, using the water balance based lumped and distributed approaches. In the lumped approach, the groundwater assessment is carried out using groundwater balance method following the methodology and norms recommended by the Groundwater Estimation Committee-2015 (referred hereafter as GEC). In the distributed approach, a physics-based hydrological model (Variable Infiltration Capacity, VIC) is utilised to model the baseflow (i.e., potential recharge). Then, an attempt is made to establish the relation between VIC-based baseflow and actual (GEC-based) groundwater recharge from rainfall. Remote sensing data derived spatio-temporal information along with field-based observations have been used in the process. Dhaka City is divided into 10 zones and the groundwater assessment is made individually in these zones as well as for the entire city during 2001-2015 period. The total annual recharge is estimated as 635.35 million m(3) (or similar to 2065 mm/year per unit area). Lateral and unaccounted recharge is found to be the dominant (51.8%) process in the study area, followed by recharge from urban return flow (35.5%), rainfall (7.1%), and surface water bodies/wetlands (5.6%). The study underscores that the lateral and unaccounted recharge must not be ignored in the urban landscape underlain by alluvial aquifers and with non-hydrologic unit boundaries. The stage of groundwater development is found to vary from 117 to 320%, thus indicating overexploitation of aquifers in all the zones. The higher groundwater abstraction as compared to recharge in all the zones has led to consistent decline in groundwater level by 2-3.2 m/year across the study area. The VIC model, on the other hand, depicted that nearly 17.2% of the annual rainfall contributes towards baseflow. Further, it is observed that similar to 31% of baseflow contributes to groundwater recharge due to rainfall. Researchers can use this relationship for quick assessment of the groundwater recharge from rainfall in Dhaka, based on hydrological models with varying meteorological and land cover scenarios, especially in the light of climate change and rapid urbanisation.",
2085,"Origin of certain magnetite-bearing pegmatites in the eastern part of the Bushveld complex, South Africa Structural relations of dunitic and pyroxenitic pegmatites on Farms Grootboom and Annex Grootboom indicate that the pegmatites formed by replacement of rocks of the Critical Zone, principally thick anorthosite-norite units. Chromitite seams and pyroxenite units have locally been partly replaced. A similar body straddling the Tweefontein-De Groote-boom boundary is inferred to be of the same origin. The outer forsteritic dunite of the Onverwacht platinum pipe has formed by replacement of bronzitites of the lower part of the Critical Zone by olivine. The similarity of the hortonolite dunite core to bodies of hortonolite dunite on Annex Grootboom and Grootboom suggests that the core is likewise of replacement origin. Such an origin is consistent with structural relations of the core to the Steelpoort Main chromitite seam, as reported by Wagner and Schneiderhohn. Conversion of bronzitite to forsteritic dunite probably involved loss of Si02 and addition of MgO and FeO. The production of hortonolite dunite from bronzitite requires addition of Fe and Ti, loss of Si02 and some A1203. Conversion of anorthositic and noritic rocks to magnetite-bearing hortonolite dunite and wehrlite requires addition of FeO, Si02, and locally MgO, accompanied by loss of Si02 and A1203. In rocks originally anorthositic, loss of CaO is indicateDConstituents involved are all available in the rocks of the Critical Zone through which the solutions must have passed, and only a rearrangement is necessary. This aspect of origin, however, is at present obscure. Replacement is ascribed to fluids, probably water in large part, at high temperature and pressure. Neither the source of fluids nor the time of replacement is indicated. Â© 1964 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.",
2086,"Perspectives of Microbial Inoculation for Sustainable Development and Environmental Management How to sustainably feed a growing global population is a question still without an answer. Particularly farmers, to increase production, tend to apply more fertilizers and pesticides, a trend especially predominant in developing countries. Another challenge is that industrialization and other human activities produce pollutants, which accumulate in soils or aquatic environments, contaminating them. Not only is human well-being at risk, but also environmental health. Currently, recycling, land-filling, incineration and pyrolysis are being used to reduce the concentration of toxic pollutants from contaminated sites, but too have adverse effects on the environment, producing even more resistant and highly toxic intermediate compounds. Moreover, these methods are expensive, and are difficult to execute for soil, water, and air decontamination. Alternatively, green technologies are currently being developed to degrade toxic pollutants. This review provides an overview of current research on microbial inoculation as a way to either replace or reduce the use of agrochemicals and clean environments heavily affected by pollution. Microorganism-based inoculants that enhance nutrient uptake, promote crop growth, or protect plants from pests and diseases can replace agrochemicals in food production. Several examples of how biofertilizers and biopesticides enhance crop production are discussed. Plant roots can be colonized by a variety of favorable species and genera that promote plant growth. Microbial interventions can also be used to clean contaminated sites from accumulated pesticides, heavy metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and other industrial effluents. The potential of and key processes used by microorganisms for sustainable development and environmental management are discussed in this review, followed by their future prospects.",
2087,"Optimal design of reusing water systems in a housing complex The excessive demand for water worldwide has promoted the development of strategies for its efficient use. The industrial sector has developed several water recycle and conservation strategies that have led to reduction in the fresh water consumption and the wastewater discharged to the environment. Comparable environmental and economic benefits can accrue as a result of adopting similar water strategies in the residential sector. This paper proposes an optimization formulation for the design and operation of networks for the recycle, regeneration, and storage of water in residential complexes. Segregation of wastewater streams is considered to avoid the mixing of streams with different qualities prior to treatment and recycle. The optimization model accounts for the simultaneous minimization of the total annual cost and the fresh water consumption. A case study for a residential complex of the city of Morelia Michoacan in Mexico is used to apply the proposed approach. The results show significant economic and environmental benefits (such as reduction of natural resources consumption and waste generation) for the implementation of the proposed approach. The developed optimization model also enables tradeoff between the considered objectives.",
2088,"An Emerging Problem of Shisha Smoking among High School Students in Ethiopia Shisha smoking is also known as hookah, water pipe, goza, and nargile. Shisha use among the young is increasing globally. Shisha smoke results in a high concentration of carbon monoxide, tar, nicotine, and heavy metals which can be toxic to humans, especially with chronic exposure. This study aims to determine the prevalence and risk factors of shisha smoking among in-school adolescents in Ethiopia. Four regional states in Ethiopia (Oromia, Amhara, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Tigray) and the capital city (Addis Ababa) were the study areas. A two-stage cluster sampling approach was employed to produce a representative sample. From the sampling frames in the study areas, 36 high schools were selected randomly. A multi-level logistic regression analysis was used to account for cluster-specific random effects, the effect of individuals', and school-level variables for ever-use of shisha. A total of 3355 secondary school grade 9 and 10 students aged between 13 and 22 years took part in this study. A total of 86 (2.6%) and 20 (0.6%) of the study participants, reported that they had ever smoked or were current smokers of shisha, respectively. Of all study participants, 38.6% perceived shisha as less harmful than cigarettes and 48.5% reported that they do not know which was more harmful to health. Students were more likely to ever use shisha if they had friend/s who smoke shisha (AOR = 16.8, 95% CI: 6.4-44.3), ever smoked cigarettes (AOR = 8.2, 95% CI: 3.4-19.8), ever used khat (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.9-10.4), ever used marijuana (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.4-11.1), ever used smokeless tobacco (AOR = 3.1 95% CI: 1.1-8.4), and students had received income from their parents (AOR = 3.1 CI: 1.1-8.8). Prevalence of ever and current use of shisha among high school students is low in Ethiopia compared to many countries in Africa. The majority of adolescents perceived shisha as less harmful to health than cigarette smoking. Health education about the harmful effects of shisha should be delivered to adolescents, along with information on other substances like khat, cigarettes, marijuana, and smokeless tobacco to prevent initiation of substance use.",
2089,"A review of diffuse pollution modeling and associated implications for watershed management in China Diffuse pollution has been extensively studied in China from loading assessments to watershed management, which are important in international research. However, few studies that assess the advances of diffuse pollution modeling and studies of trace diffuse pollutants have been conducted. The adaption and development of imported model systems based on local observations and climatic features have improved study skills and presented unique characteristics. In addition to traditional diffuse pollutants (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), modeling trace heavy metals and pesticide also provides insights for watershed management. We reviewed existing literature on diffuse pollution model applications and developments in China, attempting to provide a better understanding of the advances of diffuse pollution and new research directions for pollution modeling. Diverse methods have been adopted to express diffuse pollution formation, transport and environmental impacts using modeling as an effective tool for developing management guidelines in China. Model applications at different temporal-spatial scales, development of diffuse pollution modeling for emerging pollutants, and impacts of diffuse pollution on water quality in China were analyzed. Pollution loading decreased from east to west, coinciding with farmland distributions, tillage intensity, and economic levels. The temporal patterns of pollution loading have increased in recent decades due to increased fertilizer additions and climate warming which has put more pressure on water quality. This analysis indicated that enhancing existing models, with more field observations, is key for future diffuse pollution studies of trace organic pollutants and heavy metals. Establishing national databases and validating standard model parameters are essential and currently weak points at the national scale with respect to diffuse pollution modeling. Diffuse pollution has become a challenging issue in watershed management, and agricultural diffuse pollution poses the greatest risk to watershed management in China. However, the mechanisms involved in trace pollutant transport and the environmental consequences of these pollutants are largely unknown in China, where complicated tillage methods are used and climatic conditions vary throughout the country. Accumulated field observations at diverse temporal-spatial scales are important to accurately model and perform water risk assessments.",
2090,"Assessment of groundwater quality and human health risk associated with chromium exposure in the industrial area of Ranipet, Tamil Nadu, India Rapid urbanization and industrialization leading to an increase in groundwater contamination is a serious environmental concern in India in recent years. The risk of groundwater contamination is highly pronounced in and around the Ranipet industrial area causing a threat to human health and a balanced ecosystem. In this study, 40 groundwater samples were collected in and around the industrial area of Ranipet which is largely producing Chromium (Cr) and Chromium-based chemicals. The heavy metal contamination and water quality index (WQI) were evaluated to determine groundwater quality and related human health risk assessment using the model proposed by the USEPA for adults. Based on the WQI range, it is found that more than 50% of groundwater samples are poor and non-potable. Also, the concentration of heavy metal Chromium in the groundwater exceeded the acceptable limit, i.e., 0.05 mg/L. The human health risk assessment indicates that the chronic daily intake of groundwater for the adult in the study area is in the order of Cr > Fe > Pb > Cd indicating chronic toxicity. It was also observed that the carcinogenic risk is higher than the acceptable limit (1 x 10(-6)) as a result of higher Chromium intake via ingestion. The outcome of the present study will support the stakeholders in decision-making toward regional sustainable groundwater management.",
2091,"Indoor radon concentrations in residential houses, processing factories, and mines in Neyriz, Iran PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine radon concentrations in mines, stone processing factories, residential houses, and public areas, as well as calculating its effective dose in Neyriz, Iran. METHOD: A total of 74 alpha Track detectors (CR-39 detector) were installed at the desired locations based on the US-EPA's protocol. After 3Â months the detectors were collected and delivered to a Radon Reference Laboratory for analyzing. RESULTS: Meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD, minimum and maximum radon concentrations in the sampling buildings were 29.93â€‰Â±â€‰12.63, 10.33, and 66.76Â Bq/m(3), respectively. The effective annual dose was calculated to be 0.75Â mSv/year, which was lower than the recommended value. Significant positive correlations were found between radon concentrations and some studied variables including smoking cigarettes, number of cigarettes smoked, duration of smoking, building's age, number of floors, having cracks, use of colors in the building, use of ceramic for flooring, use of stone for flooring, and gas consumption. The number of cigarettes smoked by the residents was the most important predictor of radon concentrations. Radon concentrations were lower than standard values in all sampling locations. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to conduct further studies in the field of regional geology and determine the sources that release radon in these areas to prevent further increases in radon concentration due to the proximity and plurality of mines and factories.",
2092,"Effect of long-term tillage and diversified crop rotations on nutrient uptake, profitability and energetics of maize (Zea mays) in north-western India The current cereal based systems of South Asia are under threat due to multiple challenges of declining water table, escalating energy and fuel prices, shortages of farm labour, deteriorating soil health with overarching effects of climatic variability making farming uneconomical and unattractive. Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices together with cropping system optimization have demonstrated to produce more with less while restoring, conserving and sustaining natural resources. In north-western India, maize (Zea mays L.) based systems are being advocated as an alternate to rice-based systems to address the issues of resource degradation particularly water table and climate-change-induced variability in rainfall and temperature, etc. However, targeting maize systems without futuristic best-bet crop management practices suited to production systems and ecologies, may lead to other problems. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the performance of maize in kharif 2014 under long-term CA-based [permanent bed (PB) and zero tillage (ZT)] practices with conventional tillage (CT) as main-plots and four intensified irrigated maize systems [maize-wheat-mungbean (MWMb), maize-chickpea-Sesbania (MCS), maize-mustard-mungbean (MMuMb) and maize-maize-Sesbania (MMS)] in sub-plots under an ongoing trial established in 2008. During seventh year of study, higher maize glucose equivalent yield (MGEY) was recorded in ZT (2 942 kg/ha) and PB (2 774 kg/ha) while, the lowest in CT (2 576 kg/ha). Similarly maize glucose equivalent yield under diversified maize-based rotations was invariably higher in MCS and MWMb systems compared to MMuMb and MMS rotations. The results revealed that the maximum total N, P and K uptake (134.7, 40.9 and 156.6 kg/ha) as well as the protein content (8.7%) in maize grain were recorded in ZT, and minimum in CT. However, among the cropping systems plots the kharif maize planted in MCS plots registered the highest N, P, K uptake in stover and grain and protein (8.96%) content in grain. Maize net returns and BC ratio were significantly higher under ZT and PB planting compared to CT. Net returns and BC ratio under ZT and PB were higher by 18-29% and 26-38%, compared to CT plots, respectively. The maximum gross output energy (210.1 x10(3) MJ/ha), energy efficiency (16.4) and energy intensity (8.50 MJ/(sic)) were recorded under ZT. Tillage and cropping system interactions significantly influenced maize cob and grain yield in 7th year of experimentation and maximum yield was in ZT-MCS. Overall, our long-term results suggest that adoption of conservation agriculture-based tillage under MCS and MWMb systems can enhance crop productivity, profitability, nutrient uptake and energetics of kharif maize in north-western region of India and elsewhere under similar agroclimatic conditions.",
2093,"Nanotechnology in Wastewater and the Capacity of Nanotechnology for Sustainability About 70% of the Earth's surface is covered with water; unfortunately, there is difficulty in accessing 3% of the water as freshwater that is fit for human consumption. The paucity of safe and universal freshwater is a serious challenge across developed, transition and developing countries due to the globalisation processes and the ever-increasing consumer society. The dynamisms of the rising global demand for freshwater are the growth of the world population, industrial activities, upgrade in standards of living, altering consumption pattern and the increase of agricultural irrigation. Furthermore, climate change, such as pollution at elevated level, change in weather patterns, emission of greenhouse gases, deforestation and uneconomical use of water, are the causes of water paucity. The invariable nature of global water paucity is the geographic and temporal disproportion between the demand for freshwater and the availability of freshwater. The transformation in the development of novel nanomaterials, such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles and nanofibres, is among the most stimulating and promising innovative nanotechnologies for wastewater treatment. In this report, we reviewed the use of nanotechnology in wastewater treatment and the capacity of nanotechnology for sustainability. Thus, the major points are as follows: (1) nanotechnology in water treatment and remediation promises to overcome the major obstacles to having clean freshwater, (2) sustainability of using nanotechnology to solve the problem of water paucity of the present generation without compromising the needs of the future generations, (3) the use of nanoadsorption technology with different types of nanoadsorbents in order to provide new treatment capabilities, (4) the use of nanomembranes for water treatment to allow the economic utilisation of unconventional water sources in order to increase safe and clean water supply, (5) patents that carefully utilise nanotechnology innovations and (6) the challenges of using nanotechnology in wastewater treatment.",
2094,"Review of Yield Comparison Options for Planning Irrigation Reservoirs in Ungauged Watersheds Irrigation reservoir design is often associated with ungauged watersheds. Irrigation system planners have the option of selecting either traditional institutional guidelines or more recently calibrated and verified hydrologic models to compute watershed yield. A design watershed yield is the key for sustainable irrigation reservoir development. Design values not only should lead to reliable estimates but also require the incorporation of safety factors for both rainfall uncertainty and modelling uncertainties. Empirical design yield calculation options in guidelines require explicit rationalization to determine appropriate design levels. Use of popular watershed models, developed and calibrated with other datasets, too requires the guidance to convert the estimations as design watershed yield with the use of safety factors. Therefore, both options need to clearly express the reliability of yield estimations and the associated safety factors for a sustainable practice of water management. Comparison of available alternatives in the light of methods and incorporation of safety is a necessity to select the appropriate option for water resources design in ungauged watersheds. Accordingly, the objective of the present work is to carry out a critical review of available methods to recommend a selection for estimation of streamflow yield from ungauged watersheds. A comprehensive literature review is carried out considering available text books, guidelines and other literature. The study looked at the runoff estimation methods, strengths and difficulties, incorporation of safety factors etc., when deriving design watershed yield from watershed yield. The review of 110 related documents revealed that, although there is literature on models for the estimation of watershed yield, there is a gap in the applicability at various locations and in the conversion to design watershed yield. Irrigation Department Sri Lanka has reported the most detailed direct yield model with threshold considerations. Unit Hydrograph model has many text book references while HEC HMS is the most commonly cited process-based model for runoff estimations. The review shows that, amidst the drawbacks in the present documentation, the best available option for a practicing engineer to compute design watershed yield is to use a similar approach that is indicated in the guidelines of Irrigation Department of Sri Lanka. There is an urgent necessity to verify guideline recommended design watershed yield estimation methods by using observed data and take measures to incorporate explicit safety factors.",
2095,"RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase gene TaSDIR1-4A contributes to determination of grain size in common wheat Salt and drought-induced RING finger1 (SDIR1) is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a key role in ABA-mediated responses to salinity and drought stress via the ubiquitination pathway in some plant species. However, its function in wheat (Triticum aestivum) is unknown. Here, we isolated a SDIR1 member in wheat, TaSDIR1-4A, and characterized its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. DNA polymorphism assays showed the presence of two nucleotide variation sites in the promoter region of TaSDIR1-4A, leading to the detection of the haplotypes Hap-4A-1 and Hap-4A-2 in wheat populations. Association analysis showed that TaSDIR1-4A haplotypes were associated with 1000-grain weight (TGW) across a variety of different environments, including well-watered and heat-stress conditions. Genotypes with Hap-4A-2 had higher TGW than those with Hap-4A-1. Phenotypes in both gene-silenced wheat and transgenic Arabidopsis showed that TaSDIR1-4A was a negative regulator of grain size. Gene expression assays indicated that TaSDIR1-4A was most highly expressed in flag leaves, and expression was higher in Hap-4A-1 accessions than in Hap-4A-2 accessions. The difference might be attributable to the fact that TaERF3 (ethylene response factor) can act as a transcriptional repressor of TaSDIR1-4A in Hap-4A-2 but not in Hap-4A-1. Examination of modern wheat varieties shows that the favorable haplotype has been positively selected in breeding programs in China. The functional marker for TaSDIR1-4A developed in this study should be helpful for future wheat breeding.",
2096,"Nitrate contamination and source apportionment in surface and groundwater in Ghana using dual isotopes ((15)N and (18)O-NO(3)) and a Bayesian isotope mixing model The rising food production to meet the growing human population has led to increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients such as NO(3)(-) in groundwater and aquatic environments. Nitrate concentrations, hydrochemistry, and isotope data (Î´(18)O-H(2)O, Î´(2)H-H(2)O, (15)N-NO(3), and Î´(18)O-NO(3)) from boreholes (BH), hand dug wells (HDW), and surface water (SW) were analyzed. The objectives of the study were to identify potential nitrate sources and their proportional contributions using an isotope mixing model (SIAR). The results showed that NO(3)(-) concentrations in the BH, HDW, and SW were heterogeneous and controlled by localized anthropogenic activities. The hydrochemistry and dual isotope ((15)N-NO(3) and (18)O-NO(3)) identified manure/sewage as the dominant source of NO(3)(-) in the groundwater, while the SW showed a complex signature overlapping in the areas of manure/septic, chemical fertilizer, and soil nitrogen. The SIAR analysis showed that sewage/manure contributed about 66%, 68%, and 55% of NO(3)(-) in the BH, HDW, and SW, respectively. In the study area, the NO(3)(-) source contribution based on the mean probable estimate (MPE) were in the order S&MÂ >Â SNÂ >Â CFÂ >Â P. Shortcomings and the uncertainties associated with the SIAR to guide future studies have also been discussed. The study also highlighted the use of hydrochemistry, environmental isotopes, and Bayesian isotope mixing models for NO(3)(-) source identification and apportionment. This is to enable effective planning, farming practices, and sewage disposals to safeguard groundwater quality and control the eutrophication in rivers to meet safe drinking water demand.",
2097,"Assessment of trace elements in terminal tap water of Hunan Province, South China, and the potential health risks A total of 116 terminal tap water (TTW) samples from Xiangjiang, Zijiang, Yuanjiang, and Lishui river basins of Hunan province were collected and concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, and Cu were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results showed that 10% of the water samples exceeded the limit level of Cd established by World Health Organization (WHO) of 0.003Â mgÂ L(-1). Three percent of the samples had Fe level and 1% had As level above the WHO limits of 0.3 and 0.01Â mgÂ L(-1), respectively. Multivariate statistic approach (cluster analysis and principal component analysis) results revealed that anthropogenic activities and pipeline corrosion were major sources of TTW contamination in Hunan province. The individual and total hazard quotient values estimated by deterministic and probabilistic approaches were both less than 1. However, the mean cancer risk values of Cd were 2.2â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-4) and 1.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-4) for Xiangjiang and Yuanjiang river basin, respectively, both greater than 10(-4). The 95th percentile value of cancer risk for Cr was slightly greater than 10(-4) in Xiangjiang river basins. Long-term exposure to Cd and Cr through tap water consumption poses moderate carcinogenic health risks to the local residents.",
2098,"Ceria modified activated carbon: an efficient arsenic removal adsorbent for drinking water purification Ceria (CeO2) coated powdered activated carbon was synthesized by a single step chemical process and demonstrated to be a highly efficient adsorbent for the removal of both As(III) and As(V) from water without any pre-oxidation process. The formation of CeO2 on the surface of powdered activated carbon was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The percentage of Ce in the adsorbent was confirmed to be 3.5 % by ICP-OES. The maximum removal capacity for As(III) and As(V) was found to be 10.3 and 12.2 mg/g, respectively. These values are comparable to most of the commercially available adsorbents. 80 % of the removal process was completed within 15 min of contact time in a batch process. More than 95 % removal of both As(III) and As(V) was achieved within an hour. The efficiency of removal was not affected by change in pH (5-9), salinity, hardness, organic (1-4 ppm of humic acid) and inorganic anions (sulphate, nitrate, chloride, bicarbonate and fluoride) excluding phosphate. Presence of 100 ppm phosphate reduced the removal significantly from 90 to 18 %. The equilibrium adsorption pattern of both As(III) and As(V) fitted well with the Freundlich model with R-2 values 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. The material shows reusability greater than three times in a batch process (arsenic concentration reduced below 10 ppb from 330 ppb) and a life of at least 100 L in a column study with 80 g material when tested under natural hard water (TDS 1000 ppm, pH 7.8, hardness 600 ppm as CaCO3) spiked with 330 ppb of arsenic.",
2099,"Hydrothermal mineralization at the Dahu Au-Mo deposit in the Xiaoqinling gold field, Qinling Orogen, central China The Xiaoqinling gold field in central China is the second largest orogenic Au province in China. In the Xiaoqinling area, the Dahu Au-Mo deposit is typical because it is one of the five early-discovered large gold deposits, but also unique for its northernmost location and Mo-association. This study shows that the deposit is a fault-controlled lode system formed by a three-stage hydrothermal process. The early-stage pyrite-quartz veins are structurally deformed and broken. The middle-stage molybdenite-pyrite-quartz stockworks (mostly coaxial) infill the cracks of the early-stage veins and minerals. The late-stage open-space filling quartz-carbonate veinlets show a comb-like texture. The early-and late-stage quartz only contains the fluid inclusions of CO2-H2O and H2O-NaCl types, respectively, suggesting an evolution from CO2-rich to CO2-poor; whereas the middle-stage quartz contains fluid inclusions of CO2-H2O, H2O-NaCl, pure CO2 and daughter mineral-bearing types, supporting a boiling fluid system, because they can occur in a microscopic domain of a single crystal, homogenize divergently at similar temperatures clustering between 293 and 410 degrees C, and show contrasting salinities of <13.6wt.% and >26.3wt.% NaCl equiv. The inclusions in early-stage quartz are homogenized at 402-503 degrees C, with salinities of 4.5-10.4wt.% NaCl equiv.; and those in late-stage quartz are homogenized at temperatures of <251 degrees C, with salinities of 14.4-14.8 wt.% NaCl equiv. The trapping pressures of inclusions are estimated to be 138-331MPa in the early stage and 78-237MPa in the middle stage, implying that the fluid system alternately fluctuated from lithostatic to hydrostatic, which was controlled by a fault-valve mechanism at depths of >11 km and similar to 7.8 km, respectively. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures indicate that the fluids originated from metamorphic devolatilization in the early stage, then mixed with meteoric water in the middle stage, and finally replaced by meteoric water in the late stage. Hence, it is concluded, that metal precipitation at the Dahu deposit was mainly caused by fluid boiling, followed by fluid mixing, along with a trans-compressing at the transitional zone from a magmatic arc to back-arc basin, which resulted from the Triassic northward subduction of the Mian-Lue oceanic slab.

2100,"Urinary heavy metals in Hispanics 40-85Â years old in DoÃ±a Ana County, New Mexico Exposure to As, Cd, Pb, and U among older Hispanic adults residing in underserved communities in southern New Mexico was investigated. Personal information was obtained by standardized interview from 188 adults aged 40-85Â years. Urinary metal concentrations were measured and compared to results from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Urinary As and U in study participants significantly (p < .05) exceeded NHANES reference values. Elevated urinary As concentration was significantly associated with older age, Latin American birthplace, clinic site, private-well drinking water, higher self-rated health, and diabetes. Higher urinary Cd was significantly associated with older age, clinic site, female sex, agricultural work, and current cigarette smoking. No personal characteristics were significantly associated with urinary Pb or U. Our results suggest elevated levels of As and U in this population.",
2101,"Multilayer arsenic mobilization and multimetal co-enrichment in the alluvium (Brahmaputra) plains of India: A tale of redox domination along the depth The study attempts to understand arsenic (As) mobilization in a shallow aquifer with depth variation while focusing on the potential co-occurrence of As with priority metals (zinc and lead), using a pilot scale multilevel groundwater monitoring system (MGWS). Groundwater samples (nâ€¯=â€¯72) were collected bi-weekly (every 15 days) from the multilevel sampler (4.6, 9.2 and 13.8â€¯m depths), installed at Tezpur, Sonitpur district of Brahmaputra floodplain (BFP), Assam, India, for a period of 1 year (August 2013-July 2014). Both geogenic and anthropogenic influences were found to affect the studied unconfined aquifer. At 4.6â€¯m, weathering dominated due to interaction with CO(2) and infiltrating water. Prevalent high pH (7.9-8.6) at all three depths in association with strong oxidizing condition (at 4.6â€¯m) during the drier months seem to play a crucial role in desorption based As release. Multivariate analyses revealed that redox potential (ORP) remains the primary controller of As release at all three depths. With depth, stronger anoxic conditions resulted in the dominance of reductive hydrolysis leading to a co-occurrence scenario of As (max 4.6â€¯Î¼gL(-1)) with Zn (max 2514â€¯Î¼gL(-1)) and Pb (max 740â€¯Î¼L(-1)) with influences of anthropogenic modes of activities like agriculture and dry deposition from a brick kiln. Multi-element enrichment is an emerging concern but the bigger picture would be to understand the peculiarities of individual aquifers, as a generalization can lead to missing a ton of information. In this regard, long-term multilevel monitoring can help in the predictive understanding of the vertical stratification and co-occurrences of multi-metals that can subsequently be applied for water production at the safer depths.",
2102,"Green and sustainable median on a divided multilane highway The road system in Malaysia showed good growth with increasing number of vehicles on the road. However, statistic of road accident is still at an alarming rate. There are many factor can contribute to the occurrence of an accident. If the accident was caused by road facilities such as street furniture, it is shown that the street furniture was failed to improve the safety of the road users. In this study, a new concept of materials for the construction of road dividers was purpose. The sustainable materials such as laterite soil, Cow Grass, tires and PVC pipes was used to replace the cement and iron guardrails in road divider construction. The main objectives of this study is to design characteristics of a road divider using natural material such as laterite soil, sand, grass and recycle material like used a tyre. A series of experiments such as test liquid limit, plastic limit test, standard proctor test and observations of root growth in 30 days were conducted. The result shows that the plastic index value of 35% was obtained. From the proctor compaction test, the optimum water content was 23% and maximum dry density at 15.3 kN/m(3). This value was used to build a prototype of green and sustainable raised road median. The suitability of sand used as the medium in irrigation system was approved. Permeability of sand is 10(-2) to 10 mm/s which is having a high rate of flow. The growth of Cow Grass roots was increased by 4.9 cm in 30 days. This shows that, the grass is suitable to grow in laterite soil and can be used as vegetation material. Through the impact test conducted on a model with a scale of 1:7.5, indicate the initial damage occurred when a force reaches 10N. However, the condition of the model is still stable. From the impact test conducted, the prototype of green and sustainable raised road median has a good potential to be used as existing road divider as it can absorb the impact of an accident.",
2103,"The soil water dynamics and hydraulic processes of crops with plastic film mulching in terraced dryland fields on the Loess Plateau The soil water supply is the main limiting factor for dryland crop production on the Loess Plateau in China. Local farmers have been looking for tactics to interfere with natural hydrologic processes and to conserve soil water in dry seasons. Recently, plastic film mulching has been widely used by local farms. Moreover, mulching no longer occurs before planting, instead, it is done earlier, and thus crop yields increase. Therefore, soil water hydrologic processes for fields mulched entirely with plastic film mulch require better understanding. Field experiments were conducted from October 2009 to September 2010, 2011, and 2013 to evaluate the soil water dynamics and hydrologic process in winter wheat, maize, and potato fields with plastic film mulching. The soil moisture for depths of 0-100 cm in 2010-2011 and 0-200 cm in 2013 was measured at every 20-cm depth interval during the growth period from sowing to harvesting in all of the treatments. The results showed that the soil water distribution of a plastic film-mulched field is significantly different from that of an unmulched field. The soil water of the mulched field presented an obvious inverted S-trend at depths of 0-60 cm during the growth season. During the dry season (winter and spring), under conditions of high surface evaporation and no effective rainfall, changes in the boundary conditions of the vapor migration hydrologic process between the soil and atmosphere by the mulched treatments led to an obvious increase in the soil water with wheat increasing by 3.45 (cm(3)/cm(3)) at depths of 0-20 cm and maize and potato increasing by 0.04-6.04 (cm(3)/cm(3)) at depths of 0-80 cm. This condition increased the available water to guarantee the crops' water demand at the dry seedling stage for maize and the revival stage for wheat against the threat of seasonal drought and ensured a higher crop yield.",
2104,"Potentially toxic elements in some fresh water bodies in Ethiopia A total of thirty three water samples were collected from Tinishu Akaki River, Lake Awassa, and Lake Ziway, Ethiopia. Multi-element determination of trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Ag, Cd, Sn, Hg, and Pb) in water samples was carried out by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry after acidification with 1% HNO3. The concentration (in mu g L-1) of the elements were in the range of 1.0-19, <0.42-83, 1.1-1580, <45-1760, <0.11-2.0, 0.43-13, 0.77-13, 6-300,<0.94-2.0,<0.3-1.5,<0.012-0.63, 0.13-4.8,<0.29, and 0.2-7.2 for V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Ag, Cd, Sn, Hg, and Pb, respectively. The concentrations of all the quantified elements, with the exception of Mn, were in the range of the permissible limits of the Ethiopian, European Community, and World Health Organization for both drinking water quality guidelines and irrigation water guidelines. The accuracy of the method was validated by analyzing trace elements in water standard reference material (SRM 1643e). The measured values of trace elements in the SRM agreed well with the certified values at the 95% confidence level.",
2105,"High Methanol Uptake Capacity in Two New Series of Metal-Organic Frameworks: Promising Materials for Adsorption-Driven Heat Pump Applications Two new series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), termed M-VNU-74-I and -II (where M = Mg, Ni, Co; VNU = Vietnam National University) were designed to expand the methanol uptake capacities with polar amide functionalities. The resulting MOFs, isoreticular to MOF-74, exhibited high porosity (up to 3000 m(2) g(-1)) as well as the highest reported methanol uptake [>1 g g(-1) or >400 cm(3) cm(-3)]. As a representative example, Mg-VNU-74-II was shown to maintain a remarkably high stability and methanol mass transfer capacity for at least 42 ad/desorption cycles (3 days). Indeed, these findings highlight the potential of such materials for practical use in adsorption heat pump applications.",
2106,"OCCURRENCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS IN DRINKING WATERS AS RELATED TO WATER SHORTAGE PROBLEMS IN ISTANBUL METROPOLITAN CITY As expected for the majority Of South Europe countries, Turkey Would also face serious problems related to water shortage conditions particularly for drinking water. Istanbul is one of the mega cities of the world with a Population of 13 million. Considering both European and Asian sides, average water demand is 3 x 10(6) m(3)/day. Existing raw water sources display quite different characteristics ill relation to raw water quality. Besides basic parameters set by the local as well as the international standards, daily monitoring of pesticides, taste and odor compounds, bromide and bromate levels also followed for all of the finished water samples before being introduced to the distribution system. Considering the major concern as disinfection by-products (DBPs) among all of the chlorinated by-products trihalomethanes (THMs) constitute the main group of interest. The major surrogate parameter of DBPs is mainly the natural organic matter (NOM) content of water either expressed as total organic carbon (TOC) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Therefore the control of DBPs primarily relies oil the efficiency of DOC removal from drinking waters through the application of conventional treatment methods as well as by the use of disinfection alternatives Such as ozonation, chlorine dioxide or UV-irradiation. Preoxidation either by prechlorination or by preozonation is applied to Surface water Sources of Istanbul. Following a conventional treatment scheme, post chlorination is applied as a final step in all of the treatment plants. Therefore existence of chlorinated DBPs as well as the other DBPs ill drinking waters Could possibly pose a public health risk. However, as monitored by the local authorities the THM levels are reported to be well below 100 mu g/L. Water shortage and drought conditions lead to adverse changes in water quality parameters mainly in terms of NOM characteristics. The major consequence of the diverse conditions related to the occurrence and distribution of allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter contents would be observed in the process efficiencies as well as on the DBPs formed via the action of oxidizing agents. This paper addresses the occurrence and consequences of disinfection byproducts in drinking waters as related to the water shortage problems in Istanbul Metropolitan City. Detailed information would be presented regarding the speciation and characteristics of NOM, removal efficiencies, application of conventional and novel treatment schemes in relation to the formation of DBPs and THMs.",
2107,"Reductive dissolution of jarosite by a sulfate reducing bacterial community: Secondary mineralization and microflora development Jarosite is an iron-hydroxysulfate mineral commonly found in acid mine drainage (AMD). Given its strong adsorption capacity and its ability to co-precipitation with heavy metals, jarosite is considered a potent scavenger of contaminants in AMD-impacted environments. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play an important role in the reductive dissolution of jarosite; however, the mechanism involved has yet to be elucidated. In this study, an indigenous SRB community enriched from the Dabaoshan mine area (Guangdong, China) was employed to explore the mechanism of the microbial reduction of jarosite. Different cultures, with or without dissolved sulfate and the physical separation of jarosite from bacteria by dialysis bags, were examined. Results indicate that the reduction of jarosite by SRB occurred via an indirect mechanism. In systems with dissolved sulfate, lactate was incompletely oxidized to acetate coupled with the reduction of SO(4)(2-) to S(2-), which subsequently reduced the Fe(3+) in jarosite, forming secondary minerals including vivianite, mackinawite and pyrite. In systems without dissolved sulfate, jarosite dissolution occurred prior to reduction, and similar secondary minerals formed as well. Extracellular polymeric substances secreted by SRB appeared to facilitate the release of sulfate from jarosite. Structural sulfate in the solid phase of jarosite may not be available for SRB respiration. Although direct contact between SRB and jarosite is not necessary for mineral reduction, wrapping jarosite into dialysis bags suppressed the reduction to a certain extent. Microbial community composition differed in direct contact treatments and physical separation treatments. Physical separation of the SRB community from jarosite mineral supported the growth of Citrobacter, while Desulfosporosinus dominated in direct contact treatments.",
2108,"Periodontal diseases and carotid intima-media thickness in Bangladesh Aim: To evaluate the relationship between periodontal diseases and subclinical atherosclerosis in a younger and lean South Asian population. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 917 subjects (mean age 46 years and mean body mass index 21.1 kg/m(2)) from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study in Bangladesh. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the associations between multiple clinical measures of periodontal diseases and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Results: Mean attachment loss (AL) and percentage of sites with AL >= 4 mm (% AL >= 4) were associated with increased IMT. The IMT was 20.0-mu m (95% CI: 2.2, 37.8) and 26.5-mu m (95% CI: 8.9, 44.1) higher in subjects in the top quartile of mean AL (>3.72 mm) and % AL >= 4 (>58.4%), respectively, compared to those in the bottom quartile. In a subset of 366 subjects, mean AL was positively associated with plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (p < 0.05) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Attachment loss was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in this young and lean Bangladeshi population. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm this association.",
2109,"Independent and combined effects of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene, and improved complementary feeding, on stunting and anaemia among HIV-exposed children in rural Zimbabwe: a cluster-randomised controlled trial BACKGROUND: Children exposed to HIV have a high prevalence of stunting and anaemia. We aimed to test the effect of improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) on child linear growth and haemoglobin concentrations. METHODS: We did a cluster randomised 2â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ2 factorial trial in two districts in rural Zimbabwe. Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently lived in the trial clusters (ie, the catchment area of between one and four village health workers employed by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Care) and were confirmed pregnant. Clusters were randomly allocated to standard of care (52 clusters); IYCF (20 g small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement daily for infants from 6 months to 18 months, complementary feeding counselling with context-specific messages, longitudinal delivery, and reinforcement; 53 clusters); WASH (ventilated, improved pit latrine, two hand-washing stations, liquid soap, chlorine, play space, and hygiene counselling; 53 clusters); or IYCF plus WASH (53 clusters). Participants and fieldworkers were not masked. Our co-primary outcomes were length for age Z score and haemoglobin in infants at 18 months of age. Here, we report these outcomes in the HIV-exposed children, analysed by intention to treat. We estimated the effects of the interventions by comparing the two IYCF groups with the two non-IYCF groups and the two WASH groups with the two non-WASH groups, except for outcomes with an important statistical interaction between the interventions. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01824940) and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between Nov 22, 2012, and March 27, 2015, 726 HIV-positive pregnant women were included in the trial. 668 children were evaluated at 18 months (147 from 46 standard of care clusters; 147 from 48 IYCF clusters; 184 from 44 WASH clusters; 190 from 47 IYCF plus WASH clusters). Of the 668 children, 22 (3%) were HIV-positive, 594 (89%) HIV-exposed uninfected, and 52 (8%) HIV-unknown. The IYCF intervention increased mean length for age Z score by 0Â·26 (95% CI 0Â·09-0Â·43; p=0Â·003) and haemoglobin concentration by 2Â·9 g/L (95% CI 0Â·90-4Â·90; p=0Â·005). 165 (50%) of 329 children in the non-IYCF groups were stunted, compared with 136 (40%) of 336 in the IYCF groups (absolute difference 10%, 95% CI 2-17); and the prevalence of anaemia was also lower in the IYCF groups (45 [14%] of 319) than in the non-IYCF groups (24 [7%] of 329; absolute difference 7%, 95% CI 2-12). The WASH intervention had no effect on length or haemoglobin concentration. There were no trial-related adverse or serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Since HIV-exposed children are particularly vulnerable to undernutrition and responded well to improved complementary feeding, IYCF interventions could have considerable benefits in areas of high antenatal HIV prevalence. However, elementary WASH interventions did not lead to improvements in growth.

2110,"DISTRIBUTION OF RADON AND URANIUM LEVELS IN GROUNDWATER OF DISTRICT PALWAL, SOUTHERN HARYANA, INDIA Scintillation-detector-based SMART RnDuo (AQTEK System, India) and LED fluorimeter (Quantalase Instrument, India) were used for measurements of radon and uranium concentration in 54 groundwater samples collected from different locations in the Palwal district of Haryana (India). Radon in 26% and uranium in 54% of samples were found to be at higher levels than the maximum contamination limit (11Â BqÂ l-1) for drinking water recommended by US Environmental Protection Agency and provisional guideline level (30Â Î¼gÂ l-1) stated by World Health Organization.",
2111,"Exploring a multi-exposure-pathway approach to assess human health risk associated with groundwater fluoride exposure in the semi-arid region of east India Human health risks associated with groundwater fluoride have been assessed using USEPA method in few parts of India, but those assessments were conducted based on a single value for each parameter, which may lead to certain inaccuracy and uncertainties in results. In this study, a higher degree of accuracy in health risk assessment was achieved through Monte Carlo simulations, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis. As fluoride hazards to human health are chronic, a total of 4560 water samples (N = 4560) were collected during consecutive four seasons (2 pre-monsoon and 2 post-monsoon seasons; 1140 samples/season) from the entire Birbhum district, covering all the blocks and geological settings to obtain the spatiotemporal variation of fluoride level. The Empirical Bayesian Kriging geo-statistical model was employed to determine fluoride endemic areas. Amongst all blocks, Nalhati-1 had exhibited the highest fluoride level (18.25 mg/L). The study revealed that most of the blocks are vulnerable to groundwater fluoride due to its occurrences in excess level. The average and 95th percentile values of total hazard index indicate that the infants and children populations of the district are more susceptible than the adults and teens. The sensitivity analysis revealed that water ingestion rate and fluoride concentration are the most influential parameters for higher risk of fluoride-related health hazards. Health risks were evaluated through ingestion and dermal exposure routes for infants, children, teens, and adult residents. The exposure was much higher through ingestion than dermal contacts. Ingestion of defluoridated water will reduce the health risks associated with groundwater fluoride exposure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2112,"Hydrological Aspects of Arsenic Contamination of Groundwater in Eastern India Arsenic in the Bengal Delta has been the topic of discussion for more than a decade since 73% of the population (more than 140 million people) are under deep stress for locating arsenic-free drinking water. Most of this arsenic is geogenic, having its source from the Himalayan metamorphic facies, and is carried down by major river systems and thereby accumulating on the fluvio-deltaic plains to the southeast. All the states on this path are to some extent have depicted the presence of arsenic in the subsurface groundwaters. Currently, there are two major pathways for ingesting arsenic: (1) by the drinking water; and (2) by the food chain. Various scales of health effects from skin lesions to major cancer outbreaks have been located distinctively and pathologically in about 43% of the affected population. Irrigation practices have exacerbated the lateral extent of high arsenic in this region. Secondary natural minerals Fe and Mn oxy-hydroxides seem to adsorb both the valences of arsenic and, in the presence of labile organic carbon as in dissolved organic matter, help in releasing the arsenic into the groundwaters. Shallow to intermediate depth-reducing aquifers within the Holocene floodplains are the most contaminated and range from <10 to 4600 mu g L-1. The Bengal Basin, within a few meters of sea level, has repercussions from infiltrating saline seawater, and the impacts of climate change makes the problem worse in this region. Switching groundwater wells, harvesting rainwater, and household small-scale filtration systems, are the three most effective remediation mechanisms known to the people of the Bengal Delta.",
2113,"Modeling the additive effects of Pb(II) and Cu(II) on the competitive attenuation of As(V) through solid precipitation versus adsorption to goethite Mine-related activities cause widespread contamination of aqueous environments with high concentrations of arsenic and accompanying heavy metals. The natural attenuation of As(V) in soils and groundwater under oxic conditions occurs mainly through sorption processes to iron and aluminum (hydr) oxides; as well as through the formation of highly insoluble heavy metal(II) arsenates. In the present investigation we used thermodynamic modeling to predict the environmental geochemical behavior of As(V) in the presence of Pb(II), Cu(II) and goethite, in an effort to approach the complexity of multi-component real contaminated scenarios. The key to this modeling was the coupling of a highly robust Surface Complexation Model of As(V) adsorption to goethite, which uses combined tenets of the Triple-Layer and CD-MUSIC models, together with appropriate metal(II) arsenate solid formation constants as well as those of all chemical equilibria taking place in the aqueous phase. Mixed-metal arsenates were predicted to form and increase the predominance region of the precipitation reactions for a highly surface-reactive goethite, at the expense of the adsorption mechanism, but the model yielded no aqueous As(V) released at any condition investigated.",
2114,"Biochar Improves Soil-Tomato Plant, Tomato Production, and Economic Benefits under Reduced Nitrogen Application in Northwestern China The tomato is an important economic crop that is a main ingredient of some prepared food as well as a focus of the agricultural industry. Optimizing nitrogen (N) fertilizers is essential for sustainable agricultural development, while the excessive use of N fertilizers leads to environmental and food production problems. As a soil amendment, biochar has been widely used to improve soil quality and crop yield. However, little information is available on the effects of biochar and N fertilizer reduction on tomato plant, soil characteristics in tomato cultivation and tomato production. In this study, a greenhouse experiment was carried out in Yangling, Shaanxi province, China, including four biochar levels (0, 30, 50, and 70 t ha(-1)) under drip irrigation and four N application rates (170, 190, 210, and 250 kg ha(-1)). The results showed that adding too much biochar (e.g., 70 t ha(-1)) and reducing N fertilizer too far (e.g., by 32%) will not lead to satisfactory results in terms of tomato growth, tomato yield and quality, and economic benefits. Biochar addition could significantly enhance microbial abundance, enzyme activity, and tomato growth compared with nonâ€’biochar treatments when reducing the amount of applied N fertilizer by 16% or 24% (N2 and N3). From the perspectives of tomato yield, tomato quality (sugarâ€’acid ratio and vitamin C (VC) content), and economic benefits, optimal application rate of biochar and N fertilizer based on the silty clay loam soil of northwest China under drip irrigation is proposed, respectively. The proposal is based on both multidimensional nonlinear regression models and a comparison with experimental treatments. For example, biochar addition at 50 t ha(-1) and reducing N fertilizer by 24% achieved the greatest tomato yield. Compared with non-biochar treatment under the corresponding N fertilizer level, soil enzyme activity (urease, phosphatase, and catalase), microbial abundance (bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes), leaf gas exchange parameters (gs, Pn, and Tr), and biomass increased on average by 88.76%, 7.49%, 43.23%, and 39.67%, respectively. Based on a comprehensive consideration of tomato yield, VC content, sugarâ€’acid ratio, and economic benefits, 35 t ha(-1) biochar and 200 kg ha(-1) N fertilizer is the recommended combination of biochar and nitrogen fertilizer for local farmers.",
2115,"Promoting Smart Water Systems in Developing Countries Through Innovation Partnerships: Evidence from VIA Water-Supported Projects in Africa Over the past decades, the potential of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to improve water management has been demonstrated. However, the development and/or adoption of ICT-focused water innovations in developing countries does not seem to occur at the expected pace, which calls for suitable innovation approaches. This chapter investigates how these innovations can be fostered through partnerships. The explorative analysis of 24 ICT-focused water innovation partnerships (ICT-WIPs) implemented in Africa leads to two important findings. First, it appears that these partnerships enable effective exchange of complementary tangible and intangible resources and co-creation of ICT-focused water solutions in a cost-effective and timely manner but also pose collaboration challenges due to the heterogeneity of innovation partners. Second, the analysis demonstrates the importance of concurrent use of relational (trust-based) and structural (legally binding control-based) partnership governance mechanisms to mitigate these challenges, notably by reducing opportunistic behaviours and increasing clarity of partnersâ€™ commitments and rights. We conclude that well-designed and -implemented ICT-WIPs can contribute to enhancing the capabilities of developing countries to implement the smart water systems agenda.

2116,"Mexico, the Water Stress: Challenges and Opportunities in Wastewater Treatment and Reuse A proper treatment of wastewater is important to avoid the consequences of releasing untreated wastewater into water bodies and soils, which causes harmful effects on human health and on the environment and also leads to negative social and economic consequences. Due to this, regeneration and reuse activities are of paramount importance. Many countries practice the regeneration and reuse with successful results. In developing countries because of technological and economical deficiencies, the use of strong and efficient systems of lesser cost and sophistication is required. The current situation in Mexico is described by mentioning the need of a model to make these activities as sustainable as possible and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The need to reinforce the reuse of regenerated water regarding direct or indirect potable reuse is discussed. A model of recycled water management to assure a continuous water supply is proposed from the technical, health, economical, legal, and environmental perspective to preserve quality and increase stock in the region.",
2117,"Weed management improves yield and quality of direct seeded rice Severe water shortage in Pakistan has led the researchers to develop different sowing methods of rice such as direct drilling of seed in the soil as an alternative or substitute to the flooded transplanted rice. But direct drilling of rice severs the weed proliferation which reduces crop yields. Weed control methods including hand hoeing, mechanical and chemical control were tested for weed management in direct seeded rice. All the weed control methods were effective in decreasing the total weed density and dry weight over control and improving the rice yield and quality. Higher weed suppression and increase in rice yield was resulted by hand pulling than by the mechanical hoeing. Both hand pulling and mechanical hoeing were better than herbicides in suppression of weed and increasing yield. All the herbicides resulted in more than 80 % reduction in weed density and 74-87 % decrease in weed dry weight. Maximum increase of 30 % in grain yield over control was observed in hand pulling and that of 25 % in mechanical hoeing. Both methods also resulted in improved quality and gave maximum percentage of normal kernels that is 60.47 in mechanical hoeing and 60.03 hand pulling. Increase in rice yield due to application of herbicides was 7-19 %. The order of herbicides in suppressing the weeds as well as increasing rice yield was pretilachlor > butachlor > pendimethalin.",
2118,"ON THE POLLUTION WITH ANTIBIOTICS, HEAVY METALS AND CONVENTIONAL INDICATORS IN DIGESTED WASTEWATER FROM LARGE-SCALE PIG FARMS IN JIAXING CITY, CHINA Occurrence of antibiotics and heavy metals, together with concentrations of conventional pollution indicators were assessed in digested piggery wastewater (DPW) generated in ten large-scale pig farms in Jiaxing City, China. Results showed that water quality of DPW varied in different farms as well as in different seasons. Digested piggery wastewater pollution tended to be less serious in Summer than in Spring, Autumn and Winter. Conventional pollution indicators of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and total phosphorus (TP) in Spring ranged 1008 - 18479 mg/L, 205 - 2228 mg/L, 119 - 1936 mg/L and 32.6 - 306 mg/L, respectively, being four times higher than those in Summer. Pollution of antibiotics and heavy metals in DPW was very severe for all farms. Six heavy metals (copper, Cu; zinc, Zn; lead, Pb; cadmium, Cd; nickel, Ni; and chromium, Cr) and ten antibiotics (three tetracyclines, two sulfonamides, three macrolides and two quinolones) were detectable in all the ten farms. Copper and Zn accounted for 97 +/- 3% of the total heavy metals concentrations, and their concentrations reached the discharge limits of 0.5 mg/L (Cu) and 1.5 mg/L (Zn) in most cases. The total concentrations of the ten antibiotics were in the range of 0.155 - 1,090 mu g/L. Heavy metals and antibiotics should be given intensive attention during resource utilization and treatment of DPW.",
2119,"Comparison of Prussian blue and apple-pectin efficacy on 137Cs decorporation in rats Cesium-137 (137Cs) is one of the most important nuclear fission elements that contaminated the environment after the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine (1986). The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of two chelating agent, Prussian blue and apple-pectin on 137cesium decorporation in rats. Rats were intravenously injected with a solution of 137cesium (5 kBq per rat). Chelating agents, Prussian blue or apple-pectin were given immediately after Cs contamination and during 11 days by addition of each chelating agent in drinking water at a concentration corresponding to 400 mg kg(-1) day(-1). Efficiency was evaluated 11 days after contamination (at the end of treatment) through their ability to promote Cs excretion and to reduce the radionuclide accumulation in some retention compartments (blood, liver, kidneys, spleen, skeleton and in the remaining carcass). In these conditions after treatment with Prussian blue a fivefold increase in fecal excretion of Cs was observed and was associated with a reduction in the radionuclide retention in the main organs measured. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between untreated rats and rats treated with apple-pectin. These observations were discussed in terms of ability of pectins to bind Cs and compared to recently published results obtained after treatment of Cs-contaminated children with this chelate.",
2120,"Water quality modeling to evaluate BMPs in rice paddies A water quality model applicable to rice paddies was developed using field data from 1999-2002. Use of the Dirac delta function efficiently explained the nutrient-concentration characteristics of ponded water. The model results agreed reasonably well with the observed data. The ponded-water quality was influenced primarily by fertilization; nutrient concentration was especially high during early cultivation periods. Reducing surface drainage during the fertilization period may substantially reduce nonpoint source loading from paddies. Increased weir heights and shallow irrigation methods were evaluated by the model as practical methods for reducing nutrient loading from paddies. These methods were effective in reducing surface drainage and are suggested as ""best management practices"" (BMPs) if applied based on site-specific paddy conditions.",
2121,"Arsenic contamination of groundwater and its health impact on residents in a village in West Bengal, India An in-depth study was carried out in Rajapur, an arsenic-affected village in West Bengal, India, to determine the degree of groundwater contamination with arsenic and the impact of this contamination on residents. The flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HG-AAS) method was used to measure arsenic concentrations in water and biological samples. Dermatologists recorded the dermatological features of arsenicosis. Out of a total of 336 hand-pumped tube-wells in Rajapur, 91% (307/336) contained arsenic at concentrations > 10 mug/l, and 63% (213/336) contained arsenic at > 50 mug/l. The type of arsenic in groundwater, the variation in concentrations of arsenic as the depth of tube-wells changed, and the iron concentration in the wells were also measured. Altogether 825 of 3500 residents were examined for skin lesions; of these, 149 had lesions caused by exposure to arsenic. Of the 420 biological samples collected and analysed, 92.6% (389) contained arsenic at concentrations that were above normal. Thus many villagers might be subclinically affected. Although five arsenic-filtering devices had been installed in Rajapur, it appears that villagers are still exposed to raised concentrations of arsenic in their drinking-water. Detailed village-level studies of arsenic-affected areas in West Bengal are required in order to understand the magnitude of contamination and its effects on people. Villagers are ill-informed about the dangers of drinking arsenic-contaminated water. The contamination could be brought under control by increasing community awareness of the dangers and implementing proper watershed management techniques that involve local people.",
2122,"Human health risks by potentially toxic metals in drinking water along the Hattar Industrial Estate, Pakistan This study aimed to investigate the contamination of drinking water sources with potentially toxic metals (PTMs) together with some hydrochemical characteristics in the highly populated industrial zone of Pakistan. For this purpose, drinking (n = 40) and surface (n = 20) water samples were collected and analyzed for PTM using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer (GFAAS, PerkinElmer-700, USA). The metals, including cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), showed significantly (p = 0.05) higher concentrations than their respective limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO 2011) in drinking water. The chronic daily intake (CDI) and human hazard quotient (HQ) were also evaluated. The highest daily intake through drinking water consumption was found for Ni (4.3 mu g/kg/day), while lowest for Cd (0.25 mu g/kg/day). The highest hazard quotient values were found for Cd (0.33) and Ni (0.29) that could be attributed to industrial wastewater discharge. Higher CDI and HQ values of Ni and Cd may cause chronic human health problems. According to the Chadha Piper diagram, the hydrochemical facies distribution indicated that water trend in the study area followed an order such as follows: Ca-Mg-Cl < Na-Cl < Ca-HCO3 < Na-HCO3. Statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA, correlation analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the elevated levels of PTM were attributed to industrial wastewater discharge. This study provides baseline information for policy makers and the effective management of water in populated industrialized zone.",
2123,"Early extinguishment of spontaneous combustion of coal underground by using dry-ice's rapid sublimation: A case study of application Carbon dioxide injection is an ideal approach to prevent and control spontaneous combustion of coal in coal mines, which has higher purity, wider coverage and stronger inerting effect, but its application is limited by how to produce considerable gaseous carbon dioxide underground. Liquid carbon dioxide has high risks to be used underground due to its phase-state instability. Dry-ice has stable properties, but its sublimation in normally is too slow to extinguish the fire. To address this issue, a new type of apparatus for efficiently sublimating dry-ice has been developed independently, which would yield more than 205 times as much carbon dioxide as dry-ice under normal condition. There is no external power supply during its working, but the heat for dry-ice's rapid sublimation originates from continuously running water in a copper pipe inside the apparatus, thereby greatly improving the security of the use underground. This apparatus has been successfully applied to extinguish several early spontaneous combustion in Yangmeiwu Coal Mine in China. This paper describes the apparatus and its application.",
2124,"DESIGN OF THE SPENT FUEL STORAGE WELL OF HTR-PM There are more than 400 reactors in operation to generate electricity in the world, most of them are pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors, which generate great amount of spent fuel every year. The residual heat power of the spent fuel just discharged from the reactor core is high, it is required to store the spent fuel in the spent fuel storage pool at the first 5 years after discharged from the reactor, and then the spent fuel could be moved to the interim storage facility for long term storage, or be moved to the factory for final treatment. In the accident of the Fukushima in 2011, the spent fuel pool ruptured, which led to the loss of coolant accident, it was very danger to the spent fuel assemblies stored in the pool. On the other hand, the spent fuel stored in the dry storage facility was safe in the whole process of earthquake and tsunami, which proved inherent safety of the spent fuel dry storage facility. In china, the High Temperature gas cooled Reactor (HTR) is developing for a long time in support of the government. At the first stage, HTR-10 with 10MW thermal power was designed and constructed in the Institute of Nuclear Energy Technology (INET) of Tsinghua University, and then the High Temperature Reactor-Pebble bed Modules (HTR-PM) is designed to meet the commercial application, which is in constructing process in Shandong Province. HTR has some features of the generation four nuclear power plant, including inherent safety, avoiding nuclear proliferation, could generate high temperature industrial heat, and so on. Spherical fuel elements would be used as fuel in HTR-PM, there are many coating fuel particles separated in the fuel element. As the fuel is different for the HTR and the PWR, the fuel element would be discharged into the appropriate spent fuel canister, and the canister would be stored in the appropriate interim storage facility. As the residual power density is very low for the spent fuel of HTR, the spent fuel canister could be cooled with air ventilation without water cooling process. The advantage of air cooling mode is that it is no need to consider the residual heat removal depravation due to loss of coolant accident, so as to increase the inherent safety of the spent fuel storage system. This paper introduced the design, arrangement and safety characteristics of the spent fuel storage well of HTR-PM. The spent fuel storage wells have enough capacity to hold the total spent fuel canisters for the HTR-PM. The spent fuel storage facility includes several storage wells, cold intake cabin, hot air discharge cabin, heat shield cylinders, well lids and so on. The cold intake cabin links the inlets of all the wells, which would be used to import cold air to every well. The hot air discharge cabin links the outlets of all the wells, which would be used to gather heated air discharged from every well, the heated air would be discharged to the atmosphere through the ventilating pipe at the top of the hot air cabin. The design of the spent fuel storage well and the ventilating pipe could discharge the residual heat of the spent fuel canisters in the storage wells, which could ensure the operating safety of the spent fuel storage system.",
2125,"Evaluation of synergy and bacterial regrowth in photocatalytic ozonation disinfection of municipal wastewater The use of solar and ultraviolet titanium dioxide photocatalytic ozonation processes to inactivate waterborne pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Shigella species and Vibrio cholerae) in synthetic water and secondary municipal wastewater effluent is presented. The performance indicators were bacterial inactivation efficiency, post-disinfection regrowth and synergy effects (collaboration) between ozonation and photocatalysis (photocatalytic ozonation). Photocatalytic ozonation effectively inactivated the target bacteria and positive synergistic interactions were observed, leading to synergy indices (SI) of up to 1.86 indicating a performance much higher than that of ozonation and photocatalysis individually (SI <= 1, no synergy; SI > 1 shows synergy between the two processes). Furthermore, there was a substantial reduction in contact time required for complete bacterial inactivation by 50-75% compared to the individual unit processes of ozonation and photocatalysis. Moreover, no post-treatment bacterial regrowth after 24 and 48 h in the dark was observed. Therefore, the combined processes overcame the limitations of the individual unit processes in terms of the suppression of bacterial reactivation and regrowth owing to the fact that bacterial cells were irreparably damaged. The treated wastewater satisfied the bacteriological requirements in treated wastewater for South Africa. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2126,"Demand control and quota management strategy for sustainable water use in China With enhanced economic development and population growth in recent years, total water consumption has increased significantly around the world. As the most populated and most rapidly developing country in the world, one of the major challenges for the Chinese government is to guarantee a continuous water supply to improve the livelihood of the growing population and maintain the fast development of the economy. An ever-increasing trend of water consumption has led to the construction of hydraulic structures and degradation of the ecosystem in China. Through the analysis of water consumption and water-use efficiency around the world, this study concluded that water demand management is the only option to assure a continuous supply of water to a growing population and developing economy. In this paper, water supply and demand of China over the time period 1980-2009 are analyzed to formulate water demand management strategies for a sustainable water supply. The study proposes that a water demand management strategy, based on demand control and quota management, could be a better option for sustainable water management in China. An example of the Haihe River Basin is provided to show the success of water demand management using total demand control and quota management. It can be expected that through the encouragement of a water conserving society, by water demand management, it is possible to harmonize the relationship among water, the environment, ecosystems, and human beings in China.",
2127,"The effect of water treatment processes on the biological stability of potable water The AOC (assimilable organic carbon) method was used in this study to evaluate the biological stability of potable water. The potable water was drawn from a waterworks located in a petrochemical industrial area in China. Infrared spectra analysis was adopted in this study to examine the relationship between treatment process and organic compounds in water. By monitoring the AOC concentration in groundwater, potable water and the effluent of each treatment process (biological pretreatment, ozonation, GAC adsorption), the following were noted: (1) a considerable AOC concentration could still be detected in potable water after advanced treatment processes, such as ozonation and activated carbon adsorption. Relatively poor biological stability was also noted in the potable water; (2) GAC was the most effective process with a total AOC removal efficiency of more than 80%. The corresponding biotreatment removal efficiency was only 45%. However, ozonation yielded a negative overall removal efficiency of -119%; (3) while biological pre-treatment and GAC adsorption contributed towards a biologically stable water, ozonation yielded oxidation products which were biologically unstable. Ozonation, if used, should therefore be combined with the GAC or biological processes. Treatment processes (like ozonation) which increased the amount of organics in carbonyl group would likely lead to poor product water biological stability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

2128,"Bacterial adaptation and performance of household biosand water filters in differing temperatures The household biosand filter (BSF) is a highly utilized point-of-use water treatment tool. The effect of ambient temperature on the ability of the BSF to remove microbes from water is unclear. Model filters were distributed among different temperature-controlled laboratories and dosed daily with surface water amended with sewage. Comparison of the total coliformand Escherichia coli counts in the influent versus effluent revealed an immediate drop in the removal efficiencies of filters held in colder rooms. This performance difference, however, became less pronounced over the course of the experiment until no significant performance difference was detected between filters regardless of their ambient temperature, perhaps due to microbial adaptation within the BSFs. Subsequently, two-thirds of the filters were exposed to freezing temperatures, thawed, and re-tested for microbial removal. All filters exposed to freezing temperatures showed significant drops in microbial removal compared to control filters. Filters exposed to the most extreme temperatures showed the greatest drop in performance.",
2129,"Development and optimization of analytical method for the determination of cadmium from mineral water samples by off-line solid phase extraction system using sisal fiber loaded TAR by FAAS In the present work, a minicolumn of sisal fiber loaded with tiazolylazo-Resorsinol (TAR) is proposed a preconcentration system for cadmium determination in drinking water samples by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. In the optimization was first of all a full factorial design of two levels (24) was used for preliminary evaluation of four factors, involving the variables: sampling flow rate, elution flow rate, buffer concentration and pH. This design has showed that, for the studied levels, buffer concentration and pH are significant factors. Using the established experimental conditions in the optimization step of: pH 7.0, buffer concentration of 0.009 mol L-1 for elution utilized HCl at 2.0 mol L-1, this system allows the determination of cadmium with a detection limit (LD) (3 sigma/S) of 0.05 mu g L-1 and a quantification limit (LQ) (10 sigma/S) of 0.17 mu g L-1, precision expressed as a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 2.9 and 3.4% for a cadmium concentration of 10.0 and 20.0 mu g L-1, respectively, and a preconcentration factor of 30 for a sample volume of 50.0 mL. The accuracy was confirmed by cadmium with spike tests with recuperations varying from 92% to 103%, procedure was applied for cadmium determination in drinking water samples collected from Salvador City, Bahia, Brazil. From the five samples analyzed, the achieved concentrations varied from 0.10 to 0.54 mu g L-1. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2130,"Water Quality for Agricultural Irrigation and Aquatic Arsenic Health Risk in the Altay and Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia Due to a lack of water-quality studies compared with water-quantity studies, an investigation into the factors influencing the hydrochemical composition of the rivers in the Tianshan and Altay Mountains was conducted with a model of multiple linear regression, while the suitability of the water quality for irrigation and the health risks of arsenic (As) were assessed with classical evaluation methods. The results suggest that 44.0% of the water samples from the Altay Mountains fell into the Ca-HCO3 category type, 48.0% of the water samples were of the Ca-HCO3-Cl type, and the remaining samples belonged to the Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl type. In the Tianshan Mountain area, 58.6% of the water samples fell into the Ca-HCO3 hydrochemical category, 20.7% of the water samples were of the Ca-HCO3-Cl type, and 20.7% of the water samples belonged to the Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl type. The major ions in the water were dominated by the control of the water and rock interaction. The interaction between water and rock in the Altay area controlled 69.2% of the overall variance in the As content in the river waters, and it dominated 76.2% of the variance in the Tianshan region. The river waters in the Altay and Tianshan Mountain regions are suitable for agricultural irrigation with excellent-to-good water quality. The results also suggest that there is no non-carcinogenic risk and that the carcinogenic risk is between the acceptable/tolerable risk range of 10(-6)-10(-4), except only one sample in Tianshan Mountain region. The research methodology provided a reference for revealing the potential sources of toxic element pollution, and the results provided a scientific basis for regional agricultural irrigation, as well as a reference for decision making on the environmental protection of the watershed.",
2131,"Monitoring performance or performing monitoring? Exploring the power and political dynamics underlying monitoring the MDG for rural water in Ethiopia Performance monitoring, most prominently exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals, is often perceived as providing objective results. Using the case of access to rural water supplies in Ethiopia, this article explores the power and political dynamics inherent in sector performance monitoring. It traces how the framing of access via employing different calculation methods led to divergent portrayals of water access in Ethiopia's Southern Region (23.7%-54%). While acknowledging that powerful actors can choose monitoring results to serve a particular end, such as a positive policy picture of access, this article illuminates the plural character of monitoring processes and their potential for a more reflective practice.",
2132,"Typhoid fever in sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges of diagnosis and management of infections Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), is a disease transmitted by the faecal-oral route. It continues to be a public health problem in many developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. School-age children, especially those from resource-poor settings with inadequate water and sanitation systems, are disproportionately affected. It is estimated that a total of 400,000 cases occur annually in Africa, an incidence of 50 per 100,000 persons per year. Lack of effective diagnosis often leads to inappropriate treatment and management of these infections. Additionally, the emergence and spread of S. Typhi strains having multiple resistance to nearly all commonly available drugs in most developing countries has been a major challenge to health care systems, reducing the effective treatment options for the disease, increasing treatment costs and increasing the risk of complications and death. Although not much data from sub-Saharan Africa has been published, it seems clear that typhoid is common in Nigeria, Mali, Ethiopia and Kenya. Given the importance of information on disease incidence for targeting control measures, including improved sanitation and water supply, vaccination and assessing impact, priority should be given to strengthening surveillance systems for typhoid fever.",
2133,"Performance evaluation for the improved PCF filter to apply to the water treatment plant (WTP) The ultimate object of this study is the replacement of the precipitator plus the rapid sand filter (RSF) used in the conventional water treatment plant (WTP) with single filtration equipment. The pore controllable fiber (PCF) filter which was one of the depth filters using the pump pressure was studied from 2008 to apply to the portable water production. In this study, the PCF was improved by thickening the filter media depth more than 2 times and adjusting the backwash conditions. The feed used in the main study was supplied from the Hoedong catchment of which hydraulic retention time was about 14 d. So, its average turbidity was very low as much as about 5.76 NTU and its particle size was very fine as much as about 8 mu m by weight average since it was naturally precipitated for 14 d. The purpose of this study is to discuss problems and to find solutions through performance tests of the improved PCF (let 150 mm PCF) for the WTP process. According to pilot test results, the filter showed more than 99% removal of the turbidity and so the turbidity of the filtrate was as low as 0.066 NTU after increasing the filter media depth to 150 mm even though the raw water's turbidity was as low as 8.97 NTU. Moreover, a similar pilot which was tested on the raw water of the Nacdong river for 2 months from June of 2020 showed that the filtrate turbidity was 0.065 NTU and 99.7% of the turbidity was removed from 24.9 NTU of the feed. These results hint that the PCF could be in a fair way to replace the conventional WTP in the near future. According to the performance data for nine equipment including the PCF and seven of UF membranes evaluated by BWQI that was the public organization of Busan city, Korea from to June 24 to September 17 of 2018, the PCF having 100 mm filter media depth (let 100 mm PCF) was lower than the UF by 0.3% in the turbidity removal but was higher than the UF by 11%, 22.7%, and 20% in dissolved organic carbon, Mn, and trihalomethane formation potential removal, respectively. On the other hand, results of SDI15 measurements that were the indirect indicator for colloidal showed 3.3 for the PCF and 2.3 for 6 of the UF by average which were satisfying the RO pre-treatment standard, 5.0 as the colloidal level. The colloidal removal of the 100 mm PCF was slightly worse than membranes through the comparison of the turbidity removal and the SDI15 between the 100 mm PCF and membrane. It was found that these problems were coming from the initial filtrate of the PCF. So, it was concluded that the circulation of the initial filtrate of the PCF to the feed is needed to obtain higher colloidal removal from the PCF, and it is expected that this work makes the colloidal removal of the PCF close to the membrane.",
2134,"Combining emission inventory and isotope ratio analyses for quantitative source apportionment of heavy metals in agricultural soil Two quantitative methods (emission inventory and isotope ratio analysis) were combined to apportion source contributions of heavy metals entering agricultural soils in the Lihe River watershed (Taihu region, east China). Source apportionment based on the emission inventory method indicated that for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn, the mean percentage input from atmospheric deposition was highest (62-85%), followed by irrigation (12-27%) and fertilization (1-14%). Thus, the heavy metals were derived mainly from industrial activities and traffic emissions. For Ni the combined percentage input from irrigation and fertilization was approximately 20% higher than that from atmospheric deposition, indicating that Ni was mainly derived from agricultural activities. Based on isotope ratio analysis, atmospheric deposition accounted for 57-93% of Pb entering soil, with the mean value of 69.3%, which indicates that this was the major source of Pb entering soil in the study area. The mean contributions of irrigation and fertilization to Pb pollution of soil ranged from 0% to 10%, indicating that they played only a marginally important role. Overall, the results obtained using the two methods were similar. This study provides a reliable approach for source apportionment of heavy metals entering agricultural soils in the study area, and clearly have potential application for future studies in other regions.",
2135,"Mobility of heavy metals as related to soil chemical and mineralogical characteristics of Brazilian soils In order to better understand the relationship between soil characteristics and mobility of some heavy metals, correlation studies were conducted in samples of unlimed and limed A, B and C horizons of three Brazilian soils, representative of the majority of the tropical soils. A number of chemical and mineralogical characteristics of one Oxisol and two Ultisols were related to the retardation factors (Rf) for zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb). The retardation factors, obtained in leaching column experiments, were used as an estimate of solute movement in the profile. Soil types and soil horizons were found to influence metal retardation factors which, in turn, correlated better with the chemical than the mineralogical soil characteristics. For the unlimed soil samples, the soil characteristics that significantly correlated with Zn-Rf and Cd-Rf were the sum of exchangeable bases (SB), and soil exchangeable (Ca-KCl) and non-exchangeable (Ca-HCl) calcium contents. These results showed the strong influence of the cation exchange phenomenon on the retention and mobility of these two metals. For Cu and Pb, not only SB, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and Ca-KCl and Ca-HCl but also the organic matter correlated well with the Rf, showing that complex or chelate formation may play an important role in the movement of these elements. The important soil chemical characteristics related to the retardation factors in the limed soil samples were SB for Cd, and Ca-HCl for Cu and Pb, suggesting that precipitation may also influence the mobility and retention of the latter two heavy metals in these soil samples. Soil pH influenced the heavy metals adsorption and movement as shown by the significant correlation with the retardation factors when the combined data for the unlimed and limed soil samples was considered.",
2136,"The use of factor analysis to distinguish the influence of parent material, mining and agriculture on groundwater composition in the Strumica valley, Macedonia Determination of groundwater chemistry in the Strumica valley was essential given its widespread use for irrigation in the agricultural industry. 224 samples were collected form boreholes forming the dataset for the study. The groundwater chemical composition was examined for selected analytes: As, Sr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ba, Pb, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Ti, Li, Cr, Fe, U, CaCO3, Cl-, NO3-, NH4+, SO42- and PO43-. The source and internal correlations of the analytes were subjected to multivariate statistical analyses (factor analyses), which yielded 7 factors. Geochemical maps of these factors were generated using the kriging method. The groundwater chemistry was predominantly controlled by the geology with some anthropogenic influence due to agriculture and mining, affecting the concentrations and spatial distribution of arsenic, phosphates, sulphates, nitrates and some metals (copper, iron, chromium, lead, nickel, zinc). Mining of copper/gold (molybdenum) in the region of Ilovica increased the concentration of Al, Cu, Pb, Cr, NO3-, Ni, Zn, Na, K, Li and PO43- in groundwater, but only at a local level.",
2137,"Water pollution control technology and strategy for river-lake systems: a case study in Gehu Lake and Taige Canal The Taoge water system is located in the upstream of Taihu Lake basin and is characterized by its multi-connected rivers and lakes. In this paper, current analyses of hydrology, hydrodynamics and water pollution of Gehu Lake and Taige Canal are presented. Several technologies are proposed for pollution prevention and control, and water environmental protection in the Taihu Lake basin. These included water pollution control integration technology for the water systems of Gehu Lake, Taige Canal and Caoqiao River. Additionally, river-lake water quality and quantity regulation technology, ecological restoration technology for polluted and degraded water bodies, and water environmental integration management and optimization strategies were also examined. The main objectives of these strategies are to: (a) improve environmental quality of relative water bodies, prevent pollutants from entering Gehu Lake and Taige Canal, and ensure that the clean water after the pre-treatment through Gehu Lake is not polluted before entering the Taihu Lake through Taige Canal; (b) stably and efficiently intercept and decrease the pollution load entering the lake through enhancing the river outlet ecological system structure function and water self-purifying capacity, and (c) designate Gehu Lake as a regulation system for water quality and water quantity in the Taoge water system and thus guarantee the improvement of the water quality of the inflow into Taihu Lake.",
2138,"Geophysical and hydro-chemical investigation of contamination plume in a basement complex formation around Sunmoye dumpsite in Ikire, Southwestern Nigeria Integrated geophysical survey involving Schlumberger Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES), 2D horizontal profiling and hydro-chemical analysis have been used to map pollution plume around Sunmoye dumpsite located in the basement complex of Ikire, Southwestern Nigeria. This was with a view to assessing possible groundwater pollution arising from leachate plume emanating from the dumpsite. Seventeen (17) vertical electrical sounding (VES) and Nine (9) Wenner profiling were carried out. The 2D data obtained were processed and inverted using RES2DINV inversion software. Ten (10) water samples were collected from hand dug wells for physical and chemical analysis. The geoelectric sections and the inverted 2-D resistivity structures delineate three subsurface geological units consisting of the topsoil, weathered layer and the fractured/fresh basement rock. The weathered layer constitutes the main aquifer unit. The 2-D resistivity structures show that within the premises of the dumpsite, the topsoil and the weathered basement aquifer unit are characterized by relatively low layer resistivity values of < 40 and < 20 ohm-m respectively. The relatively low resistivity values are suspected to be due to conductive leachate from the dumpsite. Results of chemical analysis of water samples from hand dug wells in the study area shows that water samples from the area around the dumpsite are characterized by relatively higher chloride concentration of > 250 mg/l, iron concentration of > 10 mg/l and lead concentration > 0.01 mg/l which confirm groundwater pollution. It can be concluded that the soils and the groundwater in the areas around the investigated dumpsite have been polluted. The polluted zone has a depth extent of about 2.5-7.5 m.",
2139,"Assessing daytime downward longwave radiation estimates for clear and cloudy skies in Southern Brazil Several well-known parameterisations for clear-sky and cloudy-sky downward longwave radiation were tested for an experimental site at Ponta Grossa (Parana State, Brazil) where all radiation components and meteorological data were measured during 279 days in spring, summer, fall and winter (2003/2004). The existing clear-sky parameterisations usually overestimate the measured values, whereas the cloudy-sky formulations underestimate measurements. Best results for clear-sky downward longwave radiation were obtained with Brutsaert's [Brutsaert, W.H., 1975. On a derivable formula for long-wave radiation from clear skies. Water Resour. Res. 11 (5), 742-744] formulation. Jacobs' [Jacobs, J.D., 1978. Radiation climate of Broughton Island. in: Barry, R.G., Jacobs, J.D. (Eds.), Energy budget studies in relation to fast-ice breakup processes in Davis Strait. Inst. of Arctic and Alp. Res. Occas. Paper No. 26. University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, pp. 105-120] and Crawford and Duchon's [Crawford, T.M., Duchon, C.E., 1999. An improved parameterization for estimating effective atmospheric emissivity for use in calculating daytime downwelling longwave radiation. J. Appl. Meteorol. 38, 474-480] equations gave the best results for cloudy skies. The parameterisations that generated the best fits were further locally calibrated, providing a useful tool for applications requiring downward longwave radiation estimates in Southern Brazil. No significant differences between spring/summer and autumn/winter were found for the coefficients of the Brutsaert's clear-sky parameterisation, whereas some seasonality may be present in Jacobs' cloudy-sky parameterisation. For practical purposes, however, little is gained in error reduction, and it is sufficient to use year-round calibrated coefficients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2140,"Seismogenic structure of the 2016 M6.2 Hutubi earthquake and its implication for the uplift process in Tian Shan: Evidence from borehole strainmeters in the near to intermediate field The Tian Shan orogenic belt has experienced intense tectonic uplift and crustal shortening in the Cenozoic due to the Indo-Eurasian collision. Earthquakes happened in the Tian Shan range provide rare opportunities to understand the ongoing tectonic model and the long-term growth of the topography. The 2016 M6. 2 Hutubi earthquake is a reverse event happened in the northern Chinese Tian Shan. However, it is controversial whether the seismogenic fault is the low-angle thrust fault that is predominant in this area. Four RZB borehole strainmeters, locating in the near to intermediate field, have recorded the coseismic strain response. Using the elastic model, the theoretic strain of two well-accepted focal mechanisms (the United States Geological Survey and the Institute of Geophysics, China Earthquake Administration) were calculated. Comparisons between the instrument record and the calculated strain show that the seismogenic fault is a high-angle backthrust fault. Fifteen measured offsets at their original azimuths, together with eight offsets in the N-S and E-W direction are consistent with the calculation results when the seismogenic fault is the backthrust fault. The high-angle backthrust fault is more efficient in creating large topographic difference in height than the prevailing low-angle thrust fault. The ratios between the vertical and horizontal displacement are 2. 89 :1 and 1 :2. 76 respectively, if the dip angles are 70 degrees and 19 degrees for the backthrust and thrust faults. It indicates that the backthrust faults in the Tian Shan range are capable of breaking individually, and they have also played a significant role in constructing the modern ultra-high relief in Tian Shan.",
2141,"Heavy metal content and toxicity of mine and quarry soils Soils formed in metallic mines and serpentinite quarries, among other unfavourable features, have high levels of heavy metals. They can release into the environment causing surface and subsurface water contamination, uptake by plants, their accumulation in the food chain and adverse effects on living organisms. In this work, we studied the magnitude of the soils' toxic effects not only on spontaneous plants but also on two species with phytoremediation potential. Several soils from two different exploitations were selected: a lead and zinc mine and a serpentinite quarry. Soils were characterized, and the pseudo-total and extractable contents of Co, Cr and Ni in soils from a serpentinite quarry were determined. The Cd, Pb and Zn pseudo-total and extractable contents were determined in soils developed in the Pb/Zn abandoned mine. Using a biotest, the chronic toxicity of the soil samples on higher plants was determined. Festuca ovina L., Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link., Sinapis alba L. and Brassica juncea L. were selected, the first two because they are spontaneous plants in the study areas and the last two because they have heavy metal phytoremediation potential. Pseudo-total contents of Co, Cr and Ni in the serpentinite quarry soils and of Zn, Pb and Cd in the Zn/Pb mine soils exceed generic reference levels. CaCl2 is the reactant that extracts the highest proportion of Co, Cr and Ni in the quarry soils and EDTA the largest proportion of Pb Zn and Cd content in the mine soils. The germination index values based on seed germination and root elongation bioassays revealed increasing plant sensitivity to the mine soils in the following order: B. juncea < S. alba < F. ovina < C. scoparius. The wide range of GI values indicates that the response of test plants to soil heavy metals depended on their concentrations and soil characteristics, especially pH and organic matter content. The pollution index indicates severe Cd, Pb and Zn contamination in the mine soils, as well as high Cr and Ni and moderate Co contamination in the serpentinite quarry soils. The performed biotests were suitable for identifying toxic soils and showed that the studied soils are toxic to the spontaneous plants, more to C. scoparius than to F. ovina. They also indicate that the mine soils are more toxic than the quarry soils for both species.",
2142,"Hydrogeochemical features of surface water and groundwater contaminated with acid mine drainage (AMD) in coal mining areas: a case study in southern Brazil Effects of acid mine drainage (AMD) were investigated in surface waters (Laranjinha River and RibeirÃ£o das Pedras stream) and groundwaters from a coal mining area sampled in two different seasons at Figueira city, ParanÃ¡ State, Brazil. The spatial data distribution indicated that the acid effluents favor the chemical elements leaching and transport from the tailings pile into the superficial water bodies or aquifers, modifying their quality. The acid groundwaters in both sampling periods (dry: pH 2.94-6.04; rainy: pH 3.25-6.63) were probably due to the AMD generation and infiltration, after the oxidation of sulfide minerals. Such acid effluents cause an increase of the solubilization rate of metals, mainly iron and aluminum, contributing to both groundwater and surface water contamination. Sulfate in high levels is a result of waters' pollution due to AMD. In some cases, high sulfate and low iron contents, associated with less acidic pH values, could indicate that AMD, previously generated, is nowadays being neutralized. The chemistry of the waters affected by AMD is controlled by the pH, sulfide minerals' oxidation, oxygen, iron content, and microbial activity. It is also influenced by seasonal variations that allow the occurrence of dissolution processes and the concentration of some chemical elements. Under the perspective of the waters' quality evaluation, the parameters such as conductivity, dissolved sodium, and sulfate concentrations acted as AMD indicators of groundwaters and surface waters affected by acid effluents.",
2143,"Speculating on tentacular infrastructures Trains, water pipes and many other infrastructures whisper, and sometimes even roar. There is the sound of metal gripping water tanks, the echoes of deep wells, the soothing sounds of rivers stifled in irrigation ditches, and the sudden rumble of the train. The visual and audible life of infrastructures reverberates through the landscape of the immense green banana and palm oil plantations of the Zona Bananera, Colombia. Walking what was before a banana emporium built by the United Fruit Company involves knowing how to move within infrastructures. This ethnographic photo-essay is a reflection on the everyday becoming of both infrastructure and peasant zoneros. 'The Octopus', as the United Fruit Company is still called by locals, expanded its tentacles through a wide variety of materials. As much as tentacles can violently suffocate they can also be tamed and tricked. By repurposing infrastructures speculative and creative lives are lived, felt and imagined.",
2144,"Identification of toxicity variations in a stream affected by industrial effluents using Daphnia magna and Ulva pertusa A comprehensive toxicity monitoring study from August to October 2011 using Daphnia magna and Ulva pertusa was conducted to identify the cause of toxicity in a stream receiving industrial effluents (IEs) from a textile and leather products manufacturing complex. Acute toxicity toward both species was observed consistently in IE, which influenced toxicity of downstream (DS) water. A toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) confirmed that both Cu and Zn were key toxicants in the IE, and that the calculated toxicity based on Cu and Zn concentrations well simulated the variation in the observed toxicity (r(2)=0.9216 and 0.7256 for D. magna and U. pertusa, respectively). In particular, U. pertusa was sensitive enough to detect acute toxicity in DS and was useful to identify Zn as a key toxicant. Activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and malondialdehyde were induced significantly in D. magna, although acute toxicity was not observed. In addition, higher levels of antioxidant enzymes were expressed in DS than upstream waters, likely due to the Cu and Zn from IE. Overall, TIE procedures with a battery of bioassays were effective for identifying the cause of lethal and sub-lethal toxicity in effluent and stream water.",
2145,"Sex-specific associations of arsenic exposure with global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in leukocytes: results from two studies in Bangladesh BACKGROUND: Depletion of global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is observed in human cancers and is strongly implicated in skin cancer development. Although arsenic (As)-a class I human carcinogen linked to skin lesion and cancer risk-is known to be associated with changes in global %5-methylcytosine (%5-mC), its influence on 5-hmC has not been widely studied. METHODS: We evaluated associations of As in drinking water, urine, and blood with global %5-mC and %5-hmC in two studies of Bangladeshi adults: (i) leukocyte DNA in the Nutritional Influences on Arsenic Toxicity study (n = 196; 49% male, 19-66 years); and (ii) peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA in the Folate and Oxidative Stress study (n = 375; 49% male, 30-63 years). RESULTS: Overall, As was not associated with global %5-mC or %5-hmC. Sex-specific analyses showed that associations of As exposure with global %5-hmC were positive in males and negative in females (P for interaction < 0.01). Analyses examining interactions by elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcys), an indicator of B-vitamin deficiency, found that tHcys also modified the association between As and global %5-hmC (P for interaction < 0.10). CONCLUSION: In two samples, we observed associations between As exposure and global %5-hmC in blood DNA that were modified by sex and tHcys. IMPACT: Our findings suggest that As induces sex-specific changes in 5-hmC, an epigenetic mark that has been associated with cancer. Future research should explore whether altered %5-hmC is a mechanism underlying the sex-specific influences of As on skin lesion and cancer outcomes.",
2146,"High resolution spatiotemporal patterns of seawater temperatures across the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef Coral reefs are under increasingly severe threat from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Anomalously high seawater temperatures in particular are known to cause coral bleaching (loss of algal symbionts in the family Symbiodiniaceae), which frequently leads to coral mortality. Remote sensing of sea surface temperature (SST) has served as an invaluable tool for monitoring physical conditions that can lead to bleaching events over relatively large scales (e.g. few kms to 100s of kms). But, it is also well known that seawater temperatures within a site can vary significantly across depths due to the combined influence of solar heating of surface waters, water column thermal stratification, and cooling from internal waves and upwelling. We deployed small autonomous benthic temperature sensors at depths ranging from 0-40m in fore reef, back reef, and lagoonal reef habitats on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System from 2000-2019. These data can be used to calculate depth-specific climatologies across reef depths and sites, and emphasize the dynamic and spatially-variable nature of coral reef physical environments.",

2148,"Dietary intake, intestinal infection, and safe drinking water among children with anemia in Peru: a cross-sectional analysis BACKGROUND: Anemia is a major public health concern that is present in 41.7% of children under 5 worldwide. The prevalence of anemia in Peru was 43.6% in 2017, a decrease by only 6.8% in 8â€‰years. Despite great efforts made by the government to reduce anemia by distributing free multi-micronutrient supplements and promote the consumption of iron rich foods, progress has been slow. The current study sought to better understand why the prevalence remains high by analyzing the dietary intake, incidence of intestinal infectious disease, and access to safe drinking water by children with anemia in Peru. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from two national surveys that were combined by child ID. Descriptive statistics was analyzed to understand the experience of children with anemia in comparison to child without anemia. Logistic multivariate regression analyses were conducted to test the associations between anemia and dietary intake, intestinal infection, and access to safe drinking water. RESULTS: The sample included 586 children between 6 and 35â€‰months. The prevalence of anemia in this population was 53%. The portion of children that consumed sufficient iron to meet the recommendation for their age was 62%. Of the children with anemia, 52% consumed sufficient iron to meet their recommendation, vs. 72% of children without anemia (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The children with anemia were more likely to have an intestinal infection during the previous year (35% vs. 26%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.057) and less likely to have access to safe drinking water (77% vs. 86%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) than those without anemia. The logistic analysis revealed that having an intestinal infection increased the odds of having anemia (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.64, CI 95% [1.041-2.584]), and having access to safe drinking waters decreased the odds of having anemia (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.578, [0.334-0.998]). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the children with anemia in Peru already consume sufficient iron to meet their daily requirement. However, they continue to have anemia, likely due to intestinal infection, such as diarrhea and parasites, from a lack of access to safe drinking water and hygienic practices.",
2149,"Pollution characteristics of lead, zinc, arsenic, and cadmium in short-term storm water roof runoff in a suburban area Pollution of hazardous elements in roof runoff has been a potential danger to aquatic ecosystem as documented in previous studies. In this study, concentrations of lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), and cadmium (Cd) in roof runoff were measured for short-term rainfall events. The concentrations of the selected elements varied to a high degree during the rainfall period, and the well-known first-flush phenomenon was not observed due to the short-term rainfall patterns. Based on event mean concentrations (EMCs) and fluxes, the elemental pollution may be ranked as Zn >> Pb > As > Cd. The average levels of Pb and Zn exceeded the fourth class value and fifth class value of the environmental quality standards for surface water in China. The relative high pollution could be caused by atmospheric deposition and the erosion of crust steel appurtenance installed above the rooftop. Furthermore, elements in particulate form dominated the roof runoff pollution, and the ratios of elements in particulate form to total amounts were 0.6 (As), 0.9 (Pb), 0.7 (Cd), and 0.5 (Zn). This study cleared the pollution characteristics of hazardous elements in short-term storm water roof runoff; it was useful for the selection of best management practices.",
2150,"[Heavy Metal Pollution of the Drinking Water Sources in the Liujiang River Basin, and Related Health Risk Assessments] The characteristics of heavy metal pollution in drinking water in the Liujiang river basin and its potential hazards on human health were investigated. In this study, the regular water-quality indices and the contents of metal elements Cd, As, Cr, Hg, Zn, Cu, Pb, Fe, and Mn in the Liujiang river and its main tributaries were detected from January to December of 2016. The health risks of drinking contaminated water were evaluated by the health risk assessment model recommended by the US EPA. The results showed that the concentrations of all of the aforementioned metal elements, except Hg, did not exceed the limits recommended by China's surface water environmental quality standard (GB 3838-2002). Pearson correlation analysis of the concentrations of metal elements indicated that Cd, Pb, As, and Fe may have similar sources, and Cu, Cr, Hg, and Zn may have source of diversity, while there was no significant correlation between the concentrations of metal elements and the pH value. The carcinogenic health risks posed by heavy metal elements in the Liujiang river basin in adults and children were 4.52E-04 a(-1) and 5.91E-04 a(-1), respectively, while the non-carcinogenic health risks were 8.96E-09 a(-1) and 1.14E-08 a(-1), respectively. The heavy metal elements in drinking water, on the basis of their average carcinogenic health risks, were ranked as Cr > As > Cd, and the risk levels ranged from 3.58E-06 to 1.21E-04 a(-1); the risk values of Cr and As were higher than the maximum allowance levels recommended by ICRP (5.0Ã—10(-5) a(-1)). Simultaneously, the risk levels of the average non-carcinogenic health risks ranged from 3.53E-12 to 2.87E-09 a(-1), and the range was lower than the maximum allowance levels recommended by EPA. Carcinogens, especially Cr and As, are the main causes of health risks in the aquatic environment of the Liujiang river basin, and should be prioritized as the main objects of aquatic environmental risk management in the Liujiang river basin.",
2151,"A radon survey in some regions of Turkey This paper presents the experimental data of a radon survey conducted in Dikili Geothermal area and Tekirdag city, located in the west and the northwest parts of Turkey. A time-integrating passive method was applied by installing a number of CR-39 nuclear track detectors in dwellings for 3 months. Then, applying chemical etching to the exposed detectors, nuclear track numbers and corresponding indoor radon concentrations were determined. Radon concentrations of the water resources drawn from wells, municipal supplies, village fountains, and spas were also determined by using a liquid scintillation detector. Soil samples were analyzed by using a gammaray spectrometer connected with an HPGe detector and the natural radionuclide concentrations were obtained. Radon concentrations of the soil samples were calculated from the secular equilibrium between (226)Ra-(222)Rn. Risk probabilities of indoor radon inhalation were calculated. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

2152,"Investigation of the effect of large-scale atmospheric signals at different time lags on the autumn precipitation of Iran's watersheds In recent decades, the upgrading of information of human beings about the Earth's climate and concern about climate change in the future has led to a better understanding of the components affecting the climate. One of the factors that has received much attention as a predictor of precipitation is teleconnection patterns, which is one of the topics of interest in hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural forecasts. Therefore, the main goal of the present study is to investigate the effect of teleconnection phenomena on autumn precipitation in Iran at different spatiotemporal scales including basin and different time lags using the Pearson correlation method and synoptical analysis. For this purpose, a network of 717 synoptic and rain gauge stations and 40 teleconnection indices at 1- to 6-month lags (from April to September) were utilized during the period 1987-2015. Finally, the type of correlation and frequency of significant signals or teleconnection (FSS) correlations were analyzed at basin and sub-basin scales. According to the results in most of the basins, the highest FSS correlations occurred at 1- to 3-month lags and in the Central Plateau basin occurred at 2- to 6-month lags. Simultaneous investigation of the effect of time lags and teleconnection indices on the FSS correlations also illustrated that the time lags and type of teleconnection indices were different in each basin. Overall, the results showed that most of the FSS correlations of autumn precipitation in most basins of Iran were well correlated to 3-month lag and Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) indices, which can be used to predict autumn precipitation using different statistical methods. Also, synoptic analysis showed that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) family indices have the most significant correlation with most studied basins, especially the peripheral and western basins of Iran. The pattern of FSS correlations is consistent with the country's topography and precipitation corridors. Also, the regional indices are intermediary to measure the impact of global indices such as ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on the Iranian climate. Based on the results, the interpretation of high correlation of teleconnection patterns with Iran basins precipitation is difficult and requires separate work, but it seems to have relation with Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) index.",
2153,"Subsurface deposition of Cu-rich massive sulphide underneath a Palaeoproterozoic seafloor hydrothermal systemthe Red Bore prospect, Western Australia The Proterozoic Bryah and Yerrida basins of Western Australia contain important base and precious metal deposits. Here we present microtextural data, trace element and S isotope analyses of massive sulphide mineralisation hosted in Palaeoproterozoic subvolcanic rocks (dolerite) recently discovered at Red Bore. The small-scale high-grade mineralisation, which extends from the sub-surface to at least 95m down-hole, is dominated by massive chalcopyrite and contains minor pyrite and Bi-Te-(Se) phases. Massive sulphide mineralisation is surrounded by discontinuous brecciated massive magnetite, and a narrow (<2m) alteration halo, which suggests very focussed fluid flow. Laser ablation ICP-MS analyses indicate that chalcopyrite contains up to 10ppm Au and in excess of 100ppm Ag. Sulphur isotope analyses of pyrite and chalcopyrite indicate a narrow range of S-34(VCD) (-0.2 to +4.6 parts per thousand), and no significant mass-independent fractionation (-0.1<S-33<+0.05 parts per thousand). Re-Os isotope analyses yield scattered values, which suggests secondary remobilisation. Despite the geographical proximity and the common Cu-Au-Ag association, the mineralisation at Red Bore has significant differences with massive sulphide mineralisation at neighbouring DeGrussa, as well as other massive sulphide deposits around the world. These differences include the geometry, sub-volcanic host rocks, extreme Cu enrichment and narrow S-34 ranges. Although a possible explanation for some of these characteristics is leaching of S and metals from the surrounding volcanic rocks, we favour formation as a result of the release of a magmatic fluid phase along very focussed pathways, and we propose that mixing of this fluid with circulating sea water contributed to sea floor mineralisation similar to neighbouring VHMS deposits. Our data are permissive of a genetic association of Red Bore mineralisation with VHMS deposits nearby, thus suggesting a direct connection between magmatism and mineralising fluids responsible for VHMS deposition at surface. Therefore, the Red Bore mineralisation may represent the magmatic roots of a VHMS system.",
2154,"Effects of whale-based tourism in Vava'u, Kingdom of Tonga: Behavioural responses of humpback whales to vessel and swimming tourism activities Vava'u, Kingdom of Tonga, is a well-established whale-watching destination in the South Pacific. Between July and October, the waters around the archipelago represent one of the most important breeding grounds for Oceania humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The Tongan government allows tourist swimming activities with whales and tour operators strongly promote the practice of swimming-with-whales, focusing primarily on mother-calf pairs. However, there is increasing evidence, derived from empirical research on swim-with-cetacean tourism, that this kind of interaction affects cetacean behaviour and can lead to negative effects on the cetaceans involved. This study represents the first assessment of humpback whales' behavioural responses to vessel and swimmer approaches in Vava'u. Fifty-six surveys took place during the 2016 and 2017 whale breeding seasons aboard dedicated research and tour vessels. Whale dive time, number of reorientation events, and respiration rates were documented in both the absence and presence of boats and swimmers. Vessel approach type, swimmer placement, and whale avoidance responses were also recorded. Results indicate that the average diving time and the proportion of time spent diving in the presence of swimming activities increased significantly for mother-calf pairs (F-2,F-36 = 18.183, P < 0.001; F-2,F-36 = 5.462, P = 0.009, respectively). Moreover, avoidance responses of whales towards tour vessels were observed for one third of vessel approaches (33.5%) and the avoidance rate was significantly affected by the boat approach type (95% CI: 20.7-69.2%, z = 3.50, P < 0.001). Finally, low levels of compliance to the existing Tongan swim-with-whales regulations were documented, in particular the stipulated whale resting time between interactions with tour operator vessels and swimmers was often not respected (38.4%). Vava'u is an important calving ground for the Oceania humpback whale population and these findings should be carefully considered by stakeholders in Tonga and at other locations where swim-with-whales opportunities are being undertaken. Effective strategies to reduce the risk of detrimental effects on the whales targeted by swimming activities, especially mother-calf pairs, are needed.",
2155,"Hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater of Bhaktapur Municipality, Nepal The present study aims to evaluate groundwater hydrogeochemistry of Bhaktapur Municipality, Nepal with respect to water types, chemical elements and their statistical variability. Samples were collected in pre-monsoon (April-June), monsoon (July-August) and post-monsoon (October-November) seasons in 2007. Laboratory analysis of samples revealed inter-seasonal variability, primarily attributed to hydrogeochemical processes. All or most of the samples exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value (GLV) for iron, conductivity and turbidity, while none of the samples exceeded WHO GLV for hardness and arsenic with minor fraction exceeding GLV for chloride content. Higher ammonia content in well water and highest phosphate concentration occurred for stone spout in pre-monsoon season. Principle component analysis highlighted three principle components while the dendrogram divided the sampling sites into four and two clusters, respectively, for well water and stone spout water sampling sites. Saturation index computed through WATEQ4F model revealed that ferrihydrite, siderite, strengite and vivianite minerals were in under-saturated state, while goethite was in supersaturated condition for each type of samples (well water and stone spout water) in both pre- and post-monsoon seasons depicting their tendency to precipitate. High degree of supersaturation in goethite mineral indicated response to temperature gradient of the reactions, while under-saturation for other minerals indicated the effect of dilution.",
2156,"Dissolution of radiation-damaged zircon in lateritic soils Zircon crystals from lateritic soils at Nsimi, Cameroon, were investigated using electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy to determine the extent of radiation damage from alpha-decay events. The soils belong to a small watershed developed on granitic rocks of the Congo craton (2.9 Ga). Interactions with fluids are evidenced by significant CaO (up to 1.5 wt%), Al2O3 (up to 2.9 wt%), and Fe2O3 (UP to 2.9 wt%) concentrations in UO2 rich regions (0.05 to 1 wt%) of the zircon. Regional heating up to 500 degrees C, related to the Pan-African orogeny about 0.6 Ga ago, has lead to the recrystallization of the radiation-damaged grains and the formation of a nanoporous microstructure. The correlation observed between the presence of dissolution features and the actual damage state of zircon shows that zircon dissolution occurs under tropical weathering conditions and with preferential dissolution of the highly radiation-damaged regions. Congruent dissolution of zircon and the limited mobility of Zr are supported by the absence of zirconium oxide precipitates in the fractures of weathered grains of zircon.",
2157,"Spatial Distribution and Health Risk Assessment of Dissolved Trace Elements in Groundwater in southern China To understand the groundwater environmental quality and the impact of trace elements in the construction of urban agglomeration in China, this study collected 58 groundwater samples from the core area of the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration (Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan) and quantitatively analyzed the content of 13 dissolved trace element and their spatial distribution characteristics. The health risk assessment model was further used to evaluate the human health risk caused by trace element pollution in groundwater. It was observed that Ba had the highest average concentration (0.28â€‰mgÂ·L(-1)), whereas Cd had the lowest (2.1 Ã— 10(-5)â€‰mgÂ·L(-1)). Compared with China's groundwater environmental quality standard, the exceeding rates of Se, Mn, Zn, and Ni concentrations were 37.93%, 17.24%, 1.72% and 1.72%, respectively. Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, and Pb did not exceed the corresponding standards. The 13 trace elements were distributed in a scattered pattern in space and the trace elements in both banks of the Xiang River, Zhuzhou, Weishui River and surrounding areas were relatively high. Health risk assessments showed that the carcinogenic risk values of Cd, Cr, and Pb and the health risk values of 10 non-carcinogenic elements were less than the corresponding maximum acceptable risk level. The health risks associated with non-carcinogenic substances through ingestion were higher than those associated with dermal absorption. Among the non-carcinogenic substances, Ba and Mn posed the greatest health risks. With respect to drinking water exposure, Cr had the highest carcinogenic risk, followed by Pb. Furthermore, Cd had the lowest carcinogenic risk. This study recommended that continuous monitoring of Ba, Mn, and Cr in groundwater should be practiced by assessing the risk of these elements in the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration.",
2158,"Physicochemical and microbiological characterization of mesquite flour (Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC) Mesquite (Prosopis julfliora (Sw.) D.C.) is a tropical tree legume fairly common in the semi-arid region of Brazil, which thrives in dry environments where other plants would hardly survive. Its seedpods can be made into flour, which is used in human food and other products such as honey, liqueur and a product similar to coffee. The major aim of this study was to characterize the physicochemical and microbiological composition of mesquite flour with a view to introducing it as a commercial raw material. The mesquite flour was analyzed to determine its water, ash, protein, lipids, total sugar, reducing sugar, total food fiber and tannin content. The minerals analyzed were calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, iron, zinc, sodium, potassium, manganese, silicon, aluminum and copper. The microbiological analysis focused on coliforms at 45 degrees C.g(-1), Bacillus cereus.g(-1), Salmonella sp..25 g(-1) and molds and yeasts.g(-1). The mesquite flour presented high levels of sugars (56.5 g. 100 g(-1)), a moderate level of proteins (9.0 g.100 g(-1)) and low levels of lipids (2.1 g.100 g(-1)). As for mineral content, the results showed a prevalence of phosphorous (749 mg. 100 g(-1)) and calcium (390 mg. 100 g(-1)). The microbiological analysis showed results below the legal limits, allowing the product to be considered appropriate from a sanitary standpoint. It was therefore concluded that mesquite flour contains a high concentration of sugars as well as other nutrients such as minerals, which are important for human and animal development.",
2159,"Application of geostatistical models to identify spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters Groundwater quality management is a priority in arid and semi-arid zones where water is scarce. Leachate from open dumping of municipal solid wastes may threaten groundwater quality. This research aimed at assessing groundwater quality of the aquifer of Shur river basin in Tehran province, Iran. The pollution potential of leachate from a landfill, located at the center of the basin, was estimated to assess its impact on the aquifer. Samples from 38 wells and 2 leachate ponds around the landfill were analyzed for their physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals. Leachate Pollution Index (LPI) and Water Quality Index (WQI) were calculated and multivariate statistical techniques were employed through geostatistical models to predict the spatial variability of groundwater quality and assess its contamination sources. The groundwater quality map was developed by GIS Interface. LPI indicated that leachate from the closed cell (LPIâ€‰=â€‰36) was more contaminating than that of the active site (LPIâ€‰=â€‰25). Kriging and cokriging geostatistical interpolation methods were applied to groundwater quality parameters. The best interpolation model was then identified through cross-validation with RMSE and GSD criteria. Cokriging yielded more accurate results than kriging. Spatial distribution maps showed high groundwater contamination and degraded water quality mainly in the central part of the basin, where the landfill was. Also, 293.7Â ha of the study area possessed poor and very poor water quality, unsuitable for drinking. This study implicated multiple approaches for groundwater quality assessment and estimated its spatial structure as an effort toward effective groundwater quality management in Shur river basin.",
2160,"Hydrogeochemical study of spas groundwaters from southeast Brazil This paper describes a hydrochemical study focusing spas groundwaters occurring at Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, Brazil, that are extensively used for drinking in public places, bottling and bathing purposes, among other. The water samples (75) for this study were taken from springs and pumped tubular wells drilled at different aquifer systems that are inserted in Parana and Southeastern Shield hydrogeological provinces. The data acquisition for temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, redox potential (Eh), dissolved gases (O-2, CO2 and H2S) and alkalinity was in situ performed for avoiding losses and modification due to transportation. The total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration was evaluated by gravimetry, the major cations and anions, iron and silica by colorimetry/atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), and fluoride by potentiometry. The acquired database allowed establish the principal trends among the parameters analyzed after assuring its consistence from expected relationships found in hydrogeochemical surveys. The groundwaters are reducing (from pH and Eh data), there is a direct TDS-EC relationship, implying on a significant correlation between their ionic strength (IS) and EC. The major ions justifying such trends were sodium, (bi)carbonate, chloride, sulfate and phosphate that also correlated positively with the IS. The spas groundwaters were classified according to the guidelines of the Brazilian Code of Mineral Waters (BCMW) and EU directive for mineral waters. The major hydrochemical facies were also determined, as well the main sources influencing the groundwater composition and possible subsurface temperatures. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

2163,"Arsenic poisoning in groundwater: health risk and geochemical sources in Bangladesh Of the 2508 water samples analyzed in 10 districts of Bangladesh, 51%, on an average, contained arsenic levels of 0.05 to 2.50 mg/l. 95% of nail, 96% of hair, and 94% of urine samples contained arsenic above the normal level. Approximately 3.58 million people out of a total of 17.92 million who are drinking water containing arsenic levels >0.20 mg/l are potentially exposed to high risk of health hazard. Eight thousand and five hundred arsenic patients are identified; they are suffering from various skin lesions, gangrene in leg, skin, lung, bladder, liver, and renal cancer. A big portion of the total population is highly vulnerable to various internal cancers. Lowest arsenic concentration in drinking water producing dermatological disease is found to be 0.103 mg/l. However, the exposure time to develop arsenicosis varies from case to case reflecting its dependence on arsenic level in drinking water and food, nutritional status, genetic variant of human being, and compounding factors. This study has determined the high intensity of fluorescent humic substances in drinking water containing elevated concentrations of arsenic and very low concentrations of heavy metals. The synergistic/antagonistic effect of fluorescent compounds present in drinking water may aggravate the toxicity of arsenic. Geochemical study suggests that arsenic may be released from both reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn (oxy)hydroxide and microbial oxidation of organic matter.",
2164,"Radioactivity of Po-210 in Drinking Water Samples of Albania Po-210 is naturally occurring alpha emitter and exists in the environmental as a result of the Pb-210 decay within the U-238 decay chain. Radioactivity in drinking-water is principally derived from two sources: the leaching of radionuclides from rocks and soils and the deposition of radionuclides from the atmosphere. In the paper, a study of the Po-210 radioactive content of drinking water in Albania was carried out. According to Albanian legislation the total alpha/beta screening was first carried out since it is a simple radioanalytical procedure, without regard to the identity of specific radionuclides. For total alpha and total beta radioactivity concentration exceeding the screening levels of 0.1 Bq/L and 1 Bq/L respectively, the determination of Po-210 activity concentrations were determined by alpha-spectrometry with low-level-activity silicon detectors. The radiochemical separation procedure on large volume of water samples (10 L) was applied. The chemical yield (efficiency) of this procedure was controlled using a standard source of Po-209. The screening of total alpha and beta showed the activity concentrations ranging from 60 +/- 6 mBq/L to 210 +/- 24mBq/L and from 250 +/- 23 mBq/L to 9400 +/- 95 mBq/L respectively. The results obtained for Po-210 activity concentration range from 3.2 +/- 0.25 mBq/L to 9.6 +/- 0.8 mBq/L.",
2165,"CAMBODIA: FROM DEPENDENCY TO SOVEREIGNTY EMERGING NATIONAL LEADERSHIP In the millennium leading up to its days of glory and regional leadership under the iconic Angkor empire, and even in the centuries of dependence since, Cambodia has often benefited significantly from the influence of its patrons, starting with traders from India who sailed up the Mekong at the beginning of a magnificent water transport system including an inland sea. Most recently such benefits have been from global and multilateral sources. Equally, due to its pivotal strategic location at the centre of the South-East corner of Asia, Cambodia has also suffered, at times enormously, from the competing influences of a plethora of well-intentioned but radically different influences: religious, cultural, linguistic, imperial, political, ideological and educational. This article will review the educational system of Cambodia and the issues that come with achieving political and now psychological freedom from dependence on foreign dominance and tutelage.",
2166,"Trends in ion exchange: Analysis of the literature Ion exchange is an elegant concept whose simplicity has allowed a wide range of applications in separations (e.g., water treatment, chromatography, radiochemistry, food processing), catalysis and synthesis. The objective of this Perspective is to map its origin and present status, then propose a trajectory into the future. This is addressed with data mined from the open literature as reported in the Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics) via a search of the keyword ""ion exchange"" for the period 1900-1960, then narrowed to 1941-1960, followed by subsequent 20-year periods to the present day. Data are sorted into the top ten WoS Categories, Research Areas, Publication Titles and Countries, then further defined with additional keywords. Interest in ion exchange was found to be constant across the vicennial periods as the number of references kept pace with growth in the chemical (open) literature. The period to 1960 had 1213 references with chemistry the dominant area (60.9%) and engineering at only 4.5% of the papers; resins were the dominant material with membranes a distant second. The period 1961-1980 had 5175 references with chemistry retaining its top ranking but engineering significantly increasing; resins and membranes were the primary materials while separations dominated and catalysis barely registered. There were 21,901 references in 1981-2000 with environmental science appearing as a research area for the first time; resins ended the century as they began - the primary material - but by a small margin over membranes. The 21st century (2001-2020) began with 52,187 references, chemistry held steady compared to the preceding period while engineering and materials science increased significantly and environmental science doubled its percentage, joined by water resources; membranes continued their upward trend, surpassing resins. Output from China increased to outperform the USA. In the last three years of that period, environmental science made a stronger showing and energy fuels replaced biotechnology. In comparing the vicennial periods, the rise of engineering, materials science and ecology combined with water was impressive. In comparing Research Areas in the initial period with those from the latest, it is seen that chemistry fell from 61% to 41% while engineering increased from 4% to 25%. Applications were more likely to involve membranes. Separations remained steady from the initial to the current period while catalysis moved equal to them, Examining the most cited papers in the latest period shows an emphasis on metal-organic frameworks, tailored materials, membranes for energy and environmental applications, and to an array of applications in environmental remediation. Ion exchange is applied as a preparative technique in, for example, batteries, photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, supercapacitors, and perovskite nanocrystals. Ion exchange is thus poised to continue well into the 21st century. It has flourished by its ability to adapt. As the analysis of the literature shows, it will continue to flourish.",
2167,"Spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture driven by 'Grain for Green' program on the Loess Plateau, China The continuous afforestation has led to significant changes in soil moisture (SM) dynamics on the Loess Plateau, China (LPC). However, evaluating the spatio-temporal distributions and driving factors of the SM changes following afforestation is challenging because of the difficulty of accessing areas and the lack of long-term series records. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) SM product by comparing with in-situ SM data in LPC, and quantified the spatio-temporal variations of SM in different periods from 1982 to 2015 under the 'Grain for Green' program (GGP). The results showed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was well matched with the SM variations in more than 46% area of LPC from 1982 to 2015, which mainly located at the vegetated areas. The variations of SM responding to re vegetation displayed obvious southeast-negative and northwest-positive patterns, which was the wet region (annual precipitation > 450 mm) to be dry and dry region (annual precipitation <= 450 mm) to be wet. Path coefficient value revealed that the positive effect of vegetation activity for grassland on SM was ascribed to its promotion on the occurrence of rainfall (mean path coefficient = 0.278). Precipitation played vital impact on the SM in bareland and sparsely vegetated area, and evapotranspiration played a dominant role in the SM dynamic of the forestland, especially at the early stage of GGP (From 2000 to 2010), while precipitation and NDVI had stronger effects than evapotranspiration on the SM dynamics of grassland. Our study suggests that in arid and semi-arid areas, vegetation achieves the optimal water retention capacity when the vegetation fractions are 1.4%-3.7% and 3.8%-7.2%, respectively. Hence, vegetation should not be further expanded in semi-humid areas, but should be further restored in arid and semi-arid areas with sparse or excessively sparse vegetation cover (especially in desert).",
2168,"Toxic element contamination in waters from the massive sulfide deposits and wastes around Giresun, Turkey This study assessed the quality of water polluted with mine drainage waters, some of which is used for drinking and agriculture, in the urban areas of the Giresun region, Turkey. A total of 40 water samples were collected from the main rivers and stream, spring, and drainage waters. All samples were analyzed for physical and chemical parameters. The tectonically controlled massive sulfide deposits hosted in the Maastrichtian-Eocene magmatic rocks are either active or have been abandoned. The main ore mineral assemblages are chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and pyrite. The oxidation of the sulfide minerals in the deposits and wastes has caused acid mine drainage (AMD). Most of the spring, stream, and drainage waters have a strongly acidic pH and high sulfate content, and concentrations of Pb, Zn, Fe, and Cu can reach extremely high values. In addition to these elements, the concentrations of Cd, As, Mo, Se, Sb, Tl, and Bi are higher than the international and national drinking water guideline limits. Fe, Al, and Zn levels in stream, spring, and drainage waters are substantially higher than those in the rivers. The risk index values of hazardous elements in the river water show no or low risk, while most of the stream, spring, and drainage waters show high and/or extremely high risk values. The concentrations of the metals and pollution levels of most of the stream, spring, and drainage waters may pose great environmental risks through the changes they cause and disturbances brought to the living things in the area.",
2169,"Soils of the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley escarpment: A transect study The mountainous environment of the Ethiopian highlands has a great variety of ecotopes and thus demands great flexibility in land management. Different climatic conditions and landscape positions induce different soil forming processes, leading to various soil types with specific risks and potentials. The present study portrays a soil sequence of the central section of the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, from the footslopes of the eastern escarpment to the marginal volcano structures. Six profiles under natural vegetation are described for classification according to the USDA Soil Taxonomy and World Reference Base for Soil Resources classification systems, and special site characteristics are discussed. The Acacia savannah of the footslopes (1900 in a. s. 1.) is characterized by Vertisols (Mazic Vertisols/Aridic Haplusterts), with often pronounced effects of seasonal waterlogging. All other soils are well-drained and reflect the general increase in rainfall with elevation and slope, causing a decline in topsoil pH and a change from cation-rich clay soils of the Podocarpus-dominated forest at 2300 m a. s. 1. (Mollic Nitisols/Typic Palehumults) to strongly-leached Humic Urnbrisols/Humic Dystrudepts of the Hagenia-dominated forest around 2600 in a. s. 1. The highland savannah plain (2700 in a. s. 1.) with a drier and cooler environment has typically Mollic Cambisols/Dystric Haplustepts, which are less leached and have a rather brownish colour. At 2900 rn a. s. I., Niti-umbric Alisols/Andic Hapludalfs are found in the Hypericum forest at the midslopes of the marginal volcanoes receiving high rainfall, whereas soil development is at a more initial state in the Erica-dominated forest at 3200 m a. s. 1. (Umbric Andosols/Alic Hapludands). Clay mineral composition is kaolinite-dominated for the upper five profiles, with a high proportion of poorly crystalline components in the upper savannah and the volcano upslopes. The lowermost profile probably has a polygenetic origin indicated by an abrupt change from a smectitic to a kaolinitic composition in the subsoil. Soil development on quite homogeneous bedrock appears essentially controlled by relief and climate, underlining the suitability of the region as a model area for in-depth gradient studies on ecosystem processes and land use.

2170,"Characterization and Consecutive Prediction of Pore Structures in Tight Oil Reservoirs The Lucaogou Formation in Jimuaser Sag of Junggar Basin, China is a typical tight oil reservoir with upper and lower sweet spots. However, the pore structure of this formation has not been studied thoroughly due to limited core analysis data. In this paper, the pore structures of the Lucaogou Formation were characterized, and a new method applicable to oil-wet rocks was verified and used to consecutively predict pore structures by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logs. To do so, a set of experiments including X-ray diffraction (XRD), mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and NMR measurements were conducted. First, SEM images showed that pore types are mainly intragranular dissolution, intergranular dissolution, micro fractures and clay pores. Then, capillary pressure curves were divided into three types (I, II and III). The pores associated with type I and III are mainly dissolution and clay pores, respectively. Next, the new method was verified by as received and water-saturated condition T-2 distributions of two samples. Finally, consecutive prediction in fourteen wells demonstrated that the pores of this formation are dominated by nano-scale pores and the pore structure of the lower sweet spot reservoir is more complicated than that in upper sweet spot reservoir.",
2171,"A study of serum magnesium, calcium and phosphorus level, and cognition in the elderly population of South India Introduction: Different studies have shown the role of micro and macronutrients on cognitive function. Macronutrients have been involved in many metabolic activities of the body including oxidation and reduction reactions in the central nervous system. This involvement of macronutrients in the activities of central nervous system indicates its role in cognition. The present study is designed to know the role of macronutrients and its relation with cognition by using biological samples. Materials and methods: A total of 337 subjects with a mean age of 49 participated in the cross sectional study from different parts of Kerala state in India. Individuals participating in this study were administered a series of neuropsychological test batteries with major emphasis on 7-min screen test. All test procedures were administered by standard protocol after a written consent was obtained from the participating subjects. Analysis of macronutrients level of magnesium, calcium and phosphorus was done by using serum samples and the data obtained were then statistically analyzed using SPSS software version 17. Results: The macronutrients magnesium, calcium and phosphorus were found to be significantly related to the cognitive score. Increasing magnesium and calcium level was associated with higher cognitive score (P<0.0031 and 0.001 respectively), while lower phosphorus level was significantly associated with lower composite score (P<0.001). Conclusion: The results of our study give us an expression that macronutrients such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus may be associated with cognitive function in elderly population of our state. But further studies on a larger population are required to come out with a definite conclusion. (C) 2015 The Authors. Alexandria University Faculty of Medicine.

2172,"Xanthate-modified alginates for the removal of Pb(II) and Ni(II) from aqueous solutions: A brief analysis of alginate xanthation Mining is the most common activity that introduces heavy metal ions into aquatic ecosystems, especially in low income-developing nations where governments are implementing stricter regulations for industrial wastewater. In this context, this work is focused on the application of xanthate-modified alginates for the removal of Pb(II) and Ni(II) from aqueous solutions. In order to confirm the presence of xanthate groups alongside alginate chains, characterization by second-derivative FT-IR was carried out and significance evidence attributed to xanthate groups was found at around 1062-1079Â cm(-1), 829-845Â cm(-1) and 620-602Â cm(-1). In addition to this, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were employed to explore thermal properties of modified alginates. According to these results, enthalpy changes (âˆ†H) characteristic of dehydration and collapse of biopolymeric structure were estimated as +11.41Â J/g and -6.83Â J/g, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of S element was confirmed by EDS mapping technique, whereas FESEM image showed a cracked and homogeneous surface distribution. On the other hand, the effect of important parameters such as pH, dosage, initial concentration as well as Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm were deeply discussed. Finally, rheological measurements were performed aiming to investigate the gel-like viscoelastic features associated to nickel xanthate compound.",
2173,"Analysis of Human Activity Impact on Flash Floods in China from 1950 to 2015 An early warning of a flash flood is essential to prevent the general public from the hazardous flooding events, however, the rapid variation of human activities has led to the uncertainty of risk in prone areas. The lack of a systematic record of flash flood events introduces challenges to flash flood-related research. Herein, we map spatial and temporal variations in flash floods in China from 1950 to 2015 and establish a general ordered logit model in a geographic information environment to estimate the association between the occurrence of flash flood events and natural conditions and the variation of human activities at the watershed level. The results showed that precipitation is an important cause of flash flooding, and demonstrate that anthropogenic intervention (heavy rainfall, density of villages, and vegetation cover) in the environment affect the likelihood of flash floods. We found that the likelihood of flash floods in China may increase with the air quality worsening and that the occurrence of flash floods is strongly correlated with vegetation cover. Our findings suggest a need for further investigation of the link between air quality and flash flooding in flood-prone areas.",
2174,"Determination of four fluoroquinolone antibiotics in tap water in Guangzhou and Macao Four fluoroquinolone antibiotics (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and enrofloxacin) in tap water in Guangzhou and Macao were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection. The results showed that all target antibiotics were detected in high rate both in Guangzhou (77.5%) and Macao (100%), ranging from 1.0 to 679.7 ng/L (SD <or= 37.6) in Guangzhou, and from 2.0 to 37.0 ng/L (SD <or= 2.5) in Macao. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics pollution in tap water widely distributes in Guangzhou and Macao. In addition, the effect of rainfall on concentration of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in south China was also investigated. Our result indicates that the antibiotic concentration in tap water in Guangzhou tends to obviously reduce at the beginning of rainy season, even decreases below the limit of quantification immediately. Thus, it was clarified that the heavy rain in south China has the function of reducing the fluoroquinolone antibiotics concentrations in tap water.",
2175,"Recent Development of Chitosan Nanocomposites for Environmental Applications Background: Potable, clean and safe water is the basic need for all human beings. Major portion of the earth is occupied by water, however, this is contaminated by rapid industrialization, improper sewage and natural calamities and man-made activates, which produce several water-borne and fetal diseases. In this review we presented some recent patent for environmental remediation. Methods: Various technologies have been developed for the treatment of waste water consist of chemical, membrane, filtration, sedimentation, chlorination, disinfection, electrodialysis, electrolysis, reverse osmosis and adsorption. Among these entire phenomenon's, adsorption was the most efficient method for wastewater treatment, because it is a quick and cheap technology which signifies extensive practical applications. Adsorption phenomenon has been tactfully used for the removal of biological waste as well as soluble and insoluble material with a removal efficacy of 90-99%. Results: Clean water supply is limited to human beings. The people in the developing countries have less or no access to the clean and potable water. The shortage of potable water resources and long term safe water deficiencies are some of the leading problems worldwide. In this review, we have explained in the detail adsorption phenomena of chitosan, pharmaceutical importance and other applications. It is worth to say that adsorption technologies using chitosan and its derivative is one of the quickest and cost effective methods for the wastewater treatment. The review comprises of ninety eight references. This review also covers various patents vis-a-vis the role of chitosan-nanocomposite in environmental application for wastewater treatment. Conclusion: Chitosan is a pseudo-neutral cationic polymer which is formed by the de-acetylation of chitin polymer. Various patent on chitosan and chitosan-nanocomposite were taken into account related to wastewater purification. We have found that chitosan and chitosan-nanocomposite are used for the removal of viruses, bacteria, cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts, soluble and insoluble organic pollutants, poly aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals from wastewater. In this study, we also found that chitosan and chitosan-nanocomposite are selected for the removal of transition metals.",
2176,"A case of groundwater depletion in Baluchistan, Pakistan: Enter into the void Study region: Kuchlagh, Balochistan Province, Pakistan. Study focus: The depletion of groundwater is a specter presented for many parts of the world that rely on the unmanaged use of groundwater. This article describes how the alluvial aquifer in Kuchlagh was exhausted after three decades of intensive use from more than three hundred agricultural wells and how the water users gradually adapted to it. Intense nd unsustainable resource use is often expected to lead to conflict or cooperation. However, in Kuchlagh overuse did not lead to conflict nor did it trigger a process of cooperation or the use of efficient irrigation methods or the adaptation of local groundwater recharge measures. The situation is best described as a 's omicron cio-instituti omicron nal void' in which at no point in time action is taken, whereas at the same time the resource is gradually destroyed. New hydrological insights for the region: In Kuchlagh the loss of opportunities in high value horticulture were cushioned by emerging urban employment, by developing agriculture in other parts of the Province or by simply 'chasing the water table deeper', i.e. investment in pumping from the hard rock layers under-neath the alluvial aquifer. This suggests that if groundwater depletion occurs in a single isolated place it may not necessarily lead to human disaster or trigger a turn-around as the loss of resources may be compensated by other intervening opportunities.

2177,"Competition between Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima seedlings under simulated high groundwater availability Desert riparian plants experience high variability in water availability due to hydrological fluctuations. How riparian plants can survive with low water availability has been well studied, however, little is known about the effects of high water availability on plant community structuring. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test whether seedling competition under simulated high groundwater availability can explain the shift of co-dominance of Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima in early communities to P. euphratica dominance in mature ones along the Tarim River in northwestern China. Seedlings of these two plant species were grown in monoculture and mixture pools with high groundwater availability. Results indicated that the above-ground biomass and relative yield of T. ramosissima were higher than those of P. euphratica. The competitive advantages of T. ramosissima included its rapid response in growth to groundwater enrichment and its water spender strategy, as evidenced by the increased leaf biomass proportion and the inert stomatal response to leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In comparison, P. euphratica showed a conservative strategy in water use, with a sensitive response to leaf-to-air VPD. Result of the short-term competition was inconsistent with the long-term competition in fields, suggesting that competition exclusion is not the mechanism structuring the desert riparian plant communities. Thus, our research highlights the importance of mediation by environmental fluctuations (such as lessening competition induced by disturbance) in structuring plant communities along the Tarim riparian zones.",
2178,"Investigation of molten fuel coolant interaction phenomena using real time X-ray imaging of simulated woods metal-water system In liquid metal fast breeder reactors, postulated failures of the plant protection system may lead to serious unprotected accidental consequences. Unprotected transients are generically categorized as transient overpower accidents and transient under cooling accidents. In both cases, core meltdown may occur and this can lead to a molten fuel coolant interaction (MFCI). The understanding of MFCI phenomena is essential for study of debris coolability and characteristics during post-accident heat removal. Sodium is used as coolant in liquid metal fast breeder reactors. Viewing inside sodium at elevated temperature is impossible because of its opaqueness. In the present study, a methodology to depict MFCI phenomena using a flat panel detector based imaging system (i.e., real time radiography) is brought out using a woods metal-water experimental facility which simulates the UO2-Na interaction. The developed imaging system can capture attributes of the MFCI process like jet breakup length, jet front velocity, fragmented particle size, and a profile of the debris bed using digital image processing methods like image filtering, segmentation, and edge detection. This paper describes the MFCI process and developed imaging methodology to capture MFCI attributes which are directly related to the safe aspects of a sodium fast reactor.

2179,"Evaluation of the 2D reflection seismic method toward the exploration of thrust-controlled mineral deposits in southwestern Fujian Province, China The southwestern region of the Fujian Province is one of the major ore districts in China. The current model states that mineral deposition is highly controlled by thrust structure, which means that there may be concealed deposits located deep within overlapping thrust areas. Reflection seismology, which has great depth penetration and higher resolution than other geophysical methods, has great potential to delineate complex structures and give some clues to mineralization. In 2015, an experimental 2D reflection seismic survey called ""Fujian 2D"" was conducted in this region. Data were acquired along a 13.8 km length, with a source interval of 60 m, and 691 identical receivers with an equal spacing of 20 m were used to record data for each source. Due to topographical restrictions caused by the source environment, the mass or position of some shots was changed. Despite the restrictions, the average fold number reached 64 for a 10 km distance along the middle of the survey line. During the data processing procedure, conventional technologies involving static correction, noise elimination, deconvolution, and iterative velocity analyses were applied. After the prestack time migration failed to obtain a high-quality imaging result, rugged prestack depth migration (PSDM) was introduced that resulted in a better quality image of the subsurface structure and which included near-surface parts of the thrusts. In addition, P-and S-wave velocities and density data were determined from two borehole cores. Forward modeling and imaging found that the Permian marble hosting the mineral deposits has lower velocity than the surrounding rocks, where contacts give rise to strong reflections. The final rugged PSDM also clearly delineated the thrust bodies and magma intrusion zones. Combining this forward modeling with the known geology of the investigated site, the Fujian 2D reflection seismic experiment demonstrates great potential for unveiling the main elements controlling mineral deposition, such as tectonic structure, stratigraphic contacts, and lithology. Our experimental results demonstrate that reflection seismology has a wide range of applications for future mineral exploration at greater depths.",
2180,"Enhanced adsorption of congo red using cationic surfactant functionalized zeolite particles In the present work, natural and modified clinoptilolite by cationic surfactant used for congo red removal. Adsorption kinetic models showed that pseudo-second-order by R-2 > 0.99 for both adsorbents were well adapted. Congo red maximum adsorption capacities can attain 16.92 and 200 mg/g for natural and cationic surfactant modified clinoptilolite of the Langmuir isotherm, respectively. The enthalpy change (Delta H degrees) in the adsorption process are - 39.94 and -14.39 kJ/mol , showing the adsorption is an exothermic reaction. Delta S degrees < 0 shows that system confusion degree decreases and the order degree increases. The values of Delta G degrees for adsorption of CR onto NC and SMC ranges from 6242 to 9329 kJ/mol and - 3553 to - 2821 kJ/mol, respectively. The obtained results proved that cationic surfactant modified clinoptilolite powder can be applied effectively for removal of CR as natural adsorbent.",
2181,"Synthesis and characterization of gadolinium doped cobalt ferrite nanoparticles with enhanced adsorption capability for Congo Red Nanoparticles of CoFe2-xGdxO4 (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1) are synthesized by an improved hydrothermal method. Here, the doping of Gd3+ ions leads to an obvious enhancement of absorption capability for Congo Red (CR) from aqueous solution onto CoFe2-xGdxO4 nanoparticles. The morphology and structure of the samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The results indicate that the obtained samples are pure cubic spinel phase with uniform morphological structure. With increasing the doping amount of Gd3+ ions, the average particle size gradually reduces from 13 to 8 nm. The hysteresis loops are investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), where the saturation magnetization and coercivity decrease with the Gd3+ ions doping, further, a remarkable superparamagnetic behavior gradually exhibits. UV-vis spectrophotometer records the adsorption properties of as-synthesized nanoparticles for CR. Due to the substitution of Gd3+ ions, compared with undoped ferrite, the removal ability for CR increased from 131.1 to 161.1 mg g(-1). The absorption kinetics is described well by the pseudo-second-order model. Calculated from Langmuir isotherm model, the maximum adsorption capability of CR dye onto CoFe2-xGdxO4 is up to 263.2 mg g(-1), here, x = 0.07. This study demonstrates that the addition of rare earth (RE) ions can further enhance the adsorption capability of ferrite nanoparticles for dyes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2182,"A carbonate-banded iron formation transition in the Early Protorezoicum of South Africa Seven new and two resurveyed stratigraphic sections through the important carbonate-BIF transition in Griqualand West are presented and compared with six published sections. Lateral correlation within this zone is attempted but the variability was found to be too great for meaningful subdivision. Substantial lithological irregularity is the only unifying character of this zone, for which the new name Finsch Member (Formation) is proposed. Vertical and lateral lithological variations as well as chemical changes across this zone are discussed with reference to environmental aspects. Local and regional considerations lead to the conclusion that fresh water-sea water mixing occurred in a shallowing basin. Â© 1992.",
2183,"Wastewater use in agriculture in Djibouti: Effectiveness of sand filtration treatments and impact of wastewater irrigation on growth and yield of Panicum maximum In the arid climate of Djibouti, salt concentrations of up to 1200 mg L-1 have been recorded in well water, attributed to the overexploitation of aquifers. Farmers are therefore turning to untreated wastewater as a source of water for crop irrigation. The authors undertook a study in two phases. In the first phase they tested the field transposition of an experimental water treatment method previously laboratory-tested on a small scale. The pilot device was composed of an adaptor basin for the wastewater, a filter basin filled with sand and a storage basin to collect and hold the treated water. Transfer of waters from basin to basin was gravitational. The physicochemical and microbiological sleek raw water parameters were determined weekly for 7 weeks. Monitoring of chemical oxygen demand concentrations decreased from 445 +/- 5.76 mg L-1 O-2 on the first day of the experiment to 101 +/- 1.34 mg L-1 O-2 on the 21st day. The removal of total coliforms attained more than 99.6% as of day 21. The performance of the microbiological treatment of waters obtained through sand filtration is therefore of definite interest in agriculture. In the second phase the effect of different irrigation waters (untreated wastewater (WW), treated wastewater (TW), saline well water (SW), mixed water (MW) and potable water (PW)) on growth and yield of the grass Panicum maximum were also compared. The use of WW and TW in irrigation effectively increased stem height and aerial part dry matter compared to other treatments, while irrigation with SW and PW showed the lowest measured values. Depending on their performance, the effectiveness of the treated waters can be ranked in the following increasing order: TW; WW > MW > PW; SW. The performance of the TW treatment can be explained by its higher nutritive content, especially in N. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2184,"Performance-based multi-objective design and expansion of water distribution networks considering life cycle costs and future demands Designing the Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) consists of finding out pipe sizes such that the demands are satisfied and the desired performance levels are achieved at minimum cost. However, WDNs are subject to many future changes such as an increase (or decrease) in demand due to population change and migration, changes in water availability due to seasonal and climatic change, etc. Thus, the capacity expansion of WDNs needs to be performed such that the cost of interventions made is minimum while satisfying the demand and performance requirements at various time periods. Therefore, the current study proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) framework for capacity expansion of WDNs and solved using Multi-Objective Self Adaptive Differential Evolution (MOSADE). The methodology is tested on three benchmark WDNs, namely Two-loop (TL), GoYang, and Blacksburg (BLA) WDNs, and applied to a real case study of the Badlapur region Maharashtra, India. The results show that the proposed methodology leads to effective Pareto optimal fronts, making it an efficient method for solving WDN expansion problems. Subsequently, an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis was performed on the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions to determine the most suitable solution based on three criteria: Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of expansions, hydraulic reliability, and mechanical reliability. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is its capability to consider hydraulic performance as well as structural integrity and demand satisfaction in the face of hydraulic and mechanical failures. HIGHLIGHTS A novel MOSADE-DP framework for solving WDN expansion problems. Takes into consideration LCC and future water demands. Pareto-optimal fronts generated between LCC and hydraulic reliability. Multi-objective multi-criteria decision-making analysis to find out the most suitable option based on LCC, and hydraulic and mechanical reliabilities. Takes into account hydraulic performance as well as structural integrity.",
2185,"Health economics in developing countries The interpretation of health economics chosen for this paper is broad. It includes the relation between economic and other factors in health development. This interpretation has been chosen lest the acceptance of a disciplinary approach in the commissioning of papers should have the unintended effect of excluding some key areas of research which require the consideration of crucial interrelationships between disciplines. The only justification for covering this area in a paper on economics rather than, for example, epidemiology is that increasingly there is and indeed has to be a heavy focus on costs in considering alternative paths to health development. The word 'research' is loosely interpreted and not restricted to the type of activity which could lead to the award of a PhD. The compilation of experience in many areas is, in the view of the author, a priority need, to plan where further research and experiment is needed. This general discussion on health economics provides an historical overview as well as a discussion of some of the developments and deficiencies in health economics in developing countries, broadly focused on expenditure and financing studies, cost benefit and cost effectiveness, local costing studies and health planning. In 1963, it was found that as GDP rose so did health expenditures, that countries with similar per capita income spent different percentages of GDp on health services, that the private sector involvement was greater than the public, and that hospitals received most of the money. Countries were encouraged to conduct further studies. The World Bank has successfully stimulated discussion. However, lacking the expenditure studies, cost benefits are hampered by the availability of epidemiological data and poor cost information, and geared toward studies on how to cut costs for immediate goals, or specific diseases, rather than on practical advice to governments. 1 such study helped identify that most cost effective allocation of resources. The limited local cost studies are particular to understanding specific costs of immunization versus antenatal visits; however, the usefulness of such preliminary information reveals wide variability between countries. The Health for All initiatives and the limited resources in developing countries have placed health planning in a central position with Ministries of Health. Due to prior mistakes in planning an excess number of trained medical staff are underutilized and present needs have been defined as developing local PHC support staff. The WHO expectation of 5% of GNP for health service was unfulfilled because larger donor aid and local resources have not been sufficient even with strong posturing, and over ambitious plans were made unrealistically. Since 1987, WHO has provided economic strategies but the economic crises changed the needs. Many questions remain and consultants are too few, improperly trained, or unavailable for the appropriate time period: unacceptable solutions, coupled with a confusing World bank prospectus for action when more research is needed. Intersectorial collaboration has not provided answers to priorities or addressed the interactions among nutrition and agricultural policy, education and lifestyle, water and sanitation and the economy. The research agenda should include: the identification of the determinants of health, key elements of primary health care (PHC), cost of delivering PHC, hospital efficiency, health manpower mix, adequate procurement and distribution, appropriate technology, user charges for financing, health insurance, and community financing. eng",
2186,"Arsenic in drinking water from groundwater in Transylvania, Romania: an overview In the northwest region of Transylvania (Bihor and Arad counties), Romania, drinking water contains arsenic as a result of geochemical characteristic of the land. The present paper summarises the knowledge of the studies carried out in the region between 1992-1995. The geographical distribution of arsenic in drinking water in counties Bihor and Arad is spotty, with a mixture of high (mostly in the rural area) and low arsenic concentrations in contiguous areas (0-176 mug As/l). Estimates indicated that about 36,000 people are exposed to arsenic via drinking water in concentrations ranging from 11 mg/l to 48 mg/l, and about 14,000 inhabitants are exposed to water arsenic levels exceeding 50 mg/l. Significant and important differences related to the incidence and/or prevalence of cancers, cutaneous disorders, peripheral neuropathy cardiovascular diseases and also spontaneous abortions were observed in the exposed population versus the unexposed population. As a result of urinary examinations, blood pressure and haematocrit measurements in the two groups a significant difference was noticed for hematuria and albuminuria, hypertension and low haematocrit. The findings of the surveys in the northwest region of Transylvania on arsenic emphasize the need for and the importance of the extension of exposure assessment and evaluation of health impact to intermediary concentrations of arsenic in drinking water.",
2187,"EFFECT OF THE MIXTURE OF CORROSION AND SCALING INHIBITORS ON PROTECTION AGAINST CORROSION OF CARBON STEEL The advances of the new technologies in order to explore and produce oil and gas in deep and ultra-deep water is followed with challenges related to corrosion and scaling issues in production and injection wells. in the same way, scaling control in production wells due to carbonate deposition is one of the innumerous challenges of the Brazilian Pre salt. scaling leads to flow restriction and erosion problems in addition corrosion problems which may lead to a production decrease. One of the procedures adopted for removal and scaling inhibition is using inorganic (HCl) or organic (acetic acid) acids, however, the use of these ones is done by the presence of corrosion inhibitors in high level concentration which have high costs. Chelates, such as EDTA, can be used as alternatives in oil and gas wells both in stimulation operations and for the prevention and removal of scales. This work aims to study the effect of the mixture of two kinds of compounds (corrosion and scaling inhibitors) on carbon steel protection by mass loss measurements, electrochemical tests and qualitative scaling test. it was verified an increasing of the corrosion rate of carbon steel by the presence of EDTA, which was reduced by the addition of both anticorrosive and antiscaling compounds",
2188,"Five degradates of imidacloprid in source water, treated water, and tap water in Wuhan, central China Imidacloprid (IMI) is one of the most applied neonicotinoid insecticides worldwide. The occurrence of its degradates such as desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), imidacloprid-urea (IMI-urea), and desnitro-imidacloprid-olefin (DN-IMI-olefin) in environment water and their fate during drinking water treatment were seldom documented. In this study, IMI and its degradates were determined in source water (the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Hanshui River), treated water, and tap water (nÂ =Â 20, 20, and 169, respectively) in different seasons of 2019 in Wuhan, central China. Their occurrence, removal efficiency, and seasonal variations were evaluated. Advanced water treatment with ozone combined with activated carbon might remove target analytes efficiently but conventional water treatment cannot. IMI and its degradates were 100% detectable in the conventionally treated water samples in July. IMI and DN-IMI decreased while IMI-urea, DN-IMI-olefin, imidacloprid-olefin (IMI-olefin), and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (5-OH-IMI) increased during conventional drinking water treatment. IMI and its degradates were found in the tap water samples treated conventionally (range: 1.17-32.0Â ng/L for IMI; 0.57-7.00Â ng/L for DN-IMI; 0.58-4.50Â ng/L for IMI-urea; 0.04-0.65Â ng/L for DN-IMI-olefin; < method detection limit [MDL]-0.80Â ng/L for IMI-olefin; < MDL-0.35Â ng/L for 5-OH-IMI). The concentrations of DN-IMI and IMI-urea observed in this study were higher than those observed in North America. Sodium sulfite did not increase the levels of DN-IMI and IMI-urea in tap water samples in the present study. This is the first study to demonstrate the occurrence of DN-IMI and IMI-urea in water in China and the occurrence of DN-IMI-olefin, IMI-olefin, and 5-OH-IMI in water.",
2189,"Riverine nitrate source apportionment using dual stable isotopes in a drinking water source watershed of southeast China It is crucial to quantitatively track riverine nitrate (NO(3)(-)) sources and transformations in drinking water source watersheds for preventing current and future NO(3)(-) pollution, and ensuring a safe drinking water supply. This study identified the significant contributors to riverine NO(3)(-) in Zhaoshandu reservoir watershed of Zhejiang province, southeast China. To achieve this goal, we used hydrochemistry parameters and stable isotopes of NO(3)(-) (Î´(15)N-NO(3)(-) and Î´(18)O-NO(3)(-)) accompanied with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo mixing model to estimate the proportional contributions of riverine NO(3)(-) inputs from atmospheric deposition (AD), chemical nitrogen fertilizer (NF), soil nitrogen (SN), and manure and sewage (M&S). Results indicated that the main form of riverine nitrogen in this region was NO(3)(-), constituting ~60% of the total nitrogen mass on average (total organic nitrogen ~37% & ammonium ~3%). Variations in the isotopic signatures of NO(3)(-) demonstrated that microbial nitrification of NF, SN and M&S was the primary nitrogen transformation process within the Zhaoshandu reservoir watershed, whereas denitrification was minimal. A classical dual isotope bi-plot incorporating chloride concentrations suggested NF, SN and M&S were the major contributors of NO(3)(-) to the river. Riverine NO(3)(-) source apportionment results were further refined using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo mixing model, which revealed that AD, NF, SN and M&S contributed 7.6Â Â±Â 4.1%, 22.5Â Â±Â 12.8%, 27.4Â Â±Â 14.5% and 42.5Â Â±Â 11.3% of riverine NO(3)(-) at the watershed outlet, respectively. Finally, uncertainties associated with NO(3)(-) source apportionment were quantitatively characterized as: SNÂ >Â NFÂ >Â M&SÂ >Â AD. This work provides a comprehensive approach to distinguish riverine NO(3)(-) sources in drinking water source watersheds, which helps guide implementation of management strategies to effectively control NO(3)(-) contamination and protect drinking water quality. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDING FROM THIS WORKS (CAPSULE): We utilized NO(3)(-) stable isotope analysis and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo mixing model to quantify riverine nitrate pollution sources in a drinking water source watershed in Zhejiang province, southeast China. Markov Chain Monte Carlo mixing model output showed that NF, SN and M&S were the dominant sources of riverine NO(3)(-) during the sampling period in Zhaoshandu watershed. Uncertainty analysis characterized the variation strength associated with contributions of individual nitrate sources and indicated the greatest uncertainty for SN, followed by NF, M&S and AD.",
2190,"Drivers of groundwater utilization in water-limited rice production systems in Nepal Most rice farmers in Nepal's Terai region do not fully utilize irrigation during breaks in monsoon rainfall. This leads to yield losses despite abundant groundwater resources and ongoing expansion of diesel pumps and tubewell infrastructure. We investigate this puzzle by characterizing delay factors governing tubewell irrigation across wealth and precipitation gradients. After the decision to irrigate, different factors delay irrigation by roughly one week. While more sustainable and inexpensive energy for pumping may eventually catalyze transformative change, we identify near-term interventions that may increase rice farmers' resilience to water stress in smallholder-dominated farming communities based on prevailing types of irrigation infrastructure.",
2191,"Modelling The Effect of Hydraulic Conductivity on One Dimensional Contaminant Transport in RBF System Riverbank filtration (RBF) system is a surface water technology that is based on the natural treatment of filtration instead of the use of chemicals, to pre-treat surface water and provides public water supplies. Hydraulic conductivity value is one of the significant factors affecting the water quality in RBF systems. In this article, an analytical modelling is developed to investigate the effect of this parameter on one dimensional contaminant transport in RBF system. The model is solved by using Green's function approach. The model is applied for the first RBF system conducted in Malaysia. Generally, the results show that increasing the hydraulic conductivity value lead to an increase in contaminant concentration in pumping well area.",
2192,"Carbon Footprint Estimation for Oil Production: Iraq Case Study for The Utilization of Waste Gas in Generating Electricity Oil is the main energy resource on earth since its discovery, and Iraq depends mainly on crude oil to generate electricity. The process of oil extrusion differs depending on the physical nature and the accessibility of the reservoirs. In Iraq as a case study, the production of oil is easier, and relatively cost effective due to its high pressure which makes oil emerge to the surface with minimum effort compared to other deep reserves. Oil production is usually connected with high waste. In this study case, the main issues addressed are the waste of oil production and the associated gas as a co-product. Associated gas is a blend of hydrocarbons dissolved in the oil under high pressure underground reservoirs. It is naturally released when crude oil is brought to the surface under low pressure [1]. The aim of this study is to estimate the carbon footprint of crude oil production in Iraq. It considers the associated gas, a part of the production lifecycle in order to propose an alternative energy utilization solution that can reduce the energy waste as well as the carbon footprint. The energy estimation is then used to substitute the equivalent generated electricity from fossil fuel. Basic mathematics is used to estimate the potential energy of the flare gas in order to evaluate the equivalent energy losses. Umberto software is used to estimate the carbon footprint for both flared gas and the electricity generation based on kWh. While the flared gas can be reprocessed to avoid energy waste, this has its own drawbacks. The main drawback of this solution is that the gas needs to be liquefied in order to be efficiently transported. This, as a result, implies a high energy consumption as well as carbon dioxide emissions in both processing and transportation. The outcome of this study is to utilize the flared gas in generating electricity instead of the adopted method of using fossil fuel. This solution potentially saves about 50 million tons of carbon dioxide annually as per todays production rates. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",
2193,"Concluding remarks Production of Lilium has dramatically increased since the First International Symposium was convened in Korea sixteen years ago. Today, more than 2 billion bulbs are produced annually world-wide. Bulb production is increasing in the Southern Hemisphere with Chile and New Zealand as the principal exporting countries for forcing from fall to early winter. In this second symposium topics related to taxonomy and classification, bulb and flower production, physiology and bulb dormancy and flowering, nutrition, genetics (including genetic transformation) and breeding, physiology of flower scent, postharvest technologies and disease control were reported. A few of the contributions that distinguish the advances made in lily research during the past several years include: Taxonomic revisions of sections in the genus Lilium are under ongoing review. Concepts based on the value of morphological traits related to bulb structure, cell shape and structure were presented. Further research should also include genetic relationships using molecular markers and genetic compatibility between and among different sections as additional revisions are made. Lily nutrition and growth control in soil and soilless culture were evaluated on growth and flowering as well as on bulb size and weight. Although this information was developed for local conditions, it may serve as a baseline for nutrition deficiency symptoms and nutritional requirements. This information may have wider applications to other sites of production and different geographical locations. A reduction in the fragrance in Oriental lilies was achieved through the identification of four principal chemical components responsible for scent. An inhibitor of the catalytic reaction producing the odor components was identified and the inhibitor uptake in cut lily stems reduced the undesirable scent. The application of transformation technologies to introduce desirable traits through gene transfer has not yet produced a commercially acceptable product with enhanced physiological traits. A protocol was, however, developed that resulted in transient GUS expression in callus, shoots and basal plate discs using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This system will be used to introduce the rice chitinase gene to produce Lilium with enhanced fungal resistance. Molecular regulation of vernalization in lilies is important in affecting flowering time and flower quality. Understanding the process of gene regulation in vernalization will lead to a better understanding of factors that control dormancy and flowering. Subtraction libraries were generated and cDNA-AFLP analysis was applied to detect genes expressed differentially in cold vernalized and non-vernalized bulbs. Clones were analyzed for homology to known genes and those from subtraction libraries showed genes involved in dormancy. Approximately 80 species are classified in seven sections. Development of Asiatic hybrid lilies was followed by the Oriental hybrids and subsequently LA, LO, OT and OA hybrids crossing with members of different sections. The range of hybrids from these intersectional crosses will increase in the future. Depending on consumer preferences and national preferences, both large and small flowered selections will be developed. Characters that will be emphasized, in addition to flower color, will be new pollen-less and disease resistant cultivars. Six QTLs for Fusarium resistance were mapped on an Asiatic lily population. The major QTL for Fusarium resistance was confirmed in an LA population. The development of Fusarium resistant selections will be a major breakthrough in the development of disease resistant cultivars. Factors affecting the postharvest quality of cut flowers and flower bud abscission are complex. Petal wilting is apparently enhanced by low carbohydrate and not the result of ethylene. The effects of selected chemical treatments applied to foliage under controlled environment conditions showed a significant positive effect on stem height and diameter, flower size and color with a reduction in flower bud abortion and increased inflorescence longevity. Factors that influence these characteristics as well as lower leaf yellowing, should be further evaluated to improve market quality. LSV remains the most important virus in commercial culture. Although the virus is widespread, and certification standards in the EU allow up to 10% infection in commercially traded bulbs, RT-PCR is now available as the most sensitive method for virus detection of LSV, LMoV, LVX and CMV and can be utilized for certification where nuclear stocks are established. Methods of fungus disease control have remained essentially the same over many years with the use of fungicides in pre-plant treatments and postharvest. A new method of controlled hot water treatment of bulbs before and after harvest has, however, eliminated the use of formaldehyde in control of the nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans, and the bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini. Natural products have been evaluated for improved nematode control in the field with reduced use of fumigants. The use of chlorine dioxide in hot water treatments to control nematodes in harvested bulbs should be further evaluated. Improved weather forecasting based on predictive models has significantly reduced the amount fungicide used to control Botrytis elliptica in field grown lilies. Future research directions may include: (1) development of a more inclusive and comprehensive data base for lily classification based on both morphological and molecular genetics data; (2) application of new sequencing technologies for construction of a complete genetic map of lily and production of a set of molecular markers for a range of characters (QTLs) for biotic and abiotic resistances, flower keeping quality, forcing qualities, production, etc., to be used for indirect selection in breeding programs; (3) improving methods of genetic engineering resulting in selected breeding lines for disease and insect resistance and other desirable characteristics in commercial cultivars; (4) identification and manipulation of genes controlling dormancy and flowering with and improved understanding of the vernalization process; (5) selection of lilies with good fragrance and a reduction in the undesirable scent associated with some commercial cultivars; and (6) development of efficient and economical systems to produce bulbs that can be forced in developing countries. The Third International Symposium will be convened in the US in 2014 with a possible fourth symposium in China in 2018.",
2194,"Remediation of vanadium contaminated soil by nano-hydroxyapatite Purpose Vanadium (V) contamination in soil can cause diverse damage to soil ecosystem and has attracted research interests in exploring soil V stabilization methods, but only a few materials were proposed and studied. Here, a pot experiment was firstly conducted to estimate the efficiency of nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HAP) in stabilizing V in soil. To verify the impact of n-HAP on soil V bioavailability and phytotoxicity, cabbages (Brassica chinensis L.) were grown in V-spiked soils after n-HAP amendment. Materials and methods Soils were sampled from a farmland in China, and the n-HAP was prepared in the laboratory. In each pot of soil spiked with 0, 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg V, 2% n-HAP was amended for 30 days, while soils without n-HAP amendment were set as controls. The stabilization effect of n-HAP on V in soil was estimated by the water-extractable and bioavailable V concentrations in soils. Cabbages were grown in pots subsequently. The V(V/IV) concentrations in cabbage leaves and roots, the organic bound V concentrations in cabbage roots, and the chlorophyll concentrations in leaves were determined. Bioconcentration factor and translocation factor were calculated. The composition of organic bound V in leaf was characterized by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. Results and discussion In soils spiked with 150 mg/kg V, n-HAP amendment yielded the highest stabilization rates of 51.0% and 42.4% for water-extractable and bioavailable V, respectively. In 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg V-spiked soil, the plant weight, plant height, and root length of cabbage after 60-day growing decreased 54.6%/89.6%, 30.9%/45.5%, and 41.5%/51.4% in groups with/without n-HAP, respectively. Cabbage leaf chlorophyll concentrations descend firstly then ascend with rising soil V concentration. Leaf V speciation analysis revealed that less leaf V was reduced to V(IV) in groups amended with n-HAP than groups without n-HAP amendment. In 150 and 300 mg/kg V-spiked soil, n-HAP effectively reduced the V content and the V bioconcentration factor of cabbage root. Tyrosine-like and humic acid-like analogues composed the principal part of V complex. Conclusions In general, n-HAP amendments are potential to decrease the mobility of V in soils, as well as inhibit the bioavailability and phytotoxicity of V to cabbage. In V-spiked soils, n-HAP amendment can alleviate the toxicity of V to the cabbage. Overall, 2% n-HAP is efficient for the amendment of slight V-polluted (150-300 mg/kg) soils to alleviate the soil V stress to cabbage.",
2195,"Why crop yields in developing countries have not kept pace with advances in agronomy Crop research generates two distinct sets of products: improved germplasm and advances in agronomy technologies and knowledge/techniques to efficiently exploit the germplasm yield potential (Yp). The success of the Green Revolution was largely due to high farmer adoption of improved germplasm along with subsidized inputs that greatly increased average yield (Ya) from a low base. Although farmers adopted irrigation, fertilizers, machinery and other inputs that changed their agronomy and led to robust total factor productivity (TFP) growth, the Ya remained well below Yp indicating poor agronomy practice. Policies focusing on total production to meet food demand have also contributed to expansion of harvested area at low Ya and low input efficiency (low productivity of land, labor, water, fertilizer or other). Yield growth has since slowed or Ya has stalled at low levels unlike in developed countries where Ya advanced markedly closer to Yp. This paper argues that poor agronomy practice in developing countries is because of farmers' rational perception, regardless of their information needs, of high risks and low returns which do not justify the additional investments in labor and inputs required to systematically practice agronomy. As such, farmers default to low -risk, low -yield practices, even though they would temporarily switch to high -yield practices in low -risk settings, such as in agricultural projects. With poor agronomy practice, there is also little market feedback in developing countries for agronomy research products. Therefore, the potential for agronomy to dramatically increase Ya and productivity remains untapped in developing countries. To increase farmer yields and incomes without enlarging the agricultural footprint at low Ya, this paper argues that the focus must shift from relying mainly on germplasm-driven increases in total production to increasing both Ya and productivity of inputs through effective agronomy practice. This requires creating low -risk, high -return market settings for the average developing country farmer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2196,"Robust estimation of temporal resistivity variations: Changes from the 2010 Mexicali, M-w 7.2 earthquake and first results of continuous monitoring The magnetotelluric (MT) method is a well-known geophysical technique in tectonic and reservoir exploration studies. In recent years, several works have proven that the MT method is a valuable tool for monitoring fluid injection for enhanced geothermal systems and CO, sequestration due to its sensitivity to resistivity changes. However, most of these works report variations only in apparent resistivity and phase data, without estimating changes in the underground structure. Few studies have tried to deal with this problem. Efforts were made for DC-resistivity time-lapse monitoring (Goldstein et al., 1985a) and for the MT case using theoretical examples (Sholpo, 2006, 2010). Promising results had been obtained, but with scarce application to real scenarios. We propose a methodology to estimate resistivity variations in the underground geo-electrical structure by applying a linearized iterative nonlinear least-square inversion scheme using the Marquardt-Levenberg method to stabilize the inversion. The method is tested first with synthetic MT data, then with data registered on a permanent MT station in the Mexicali Valley, Mexico; and finally, with data measured before and after a M-w 7.2 earthquake, also in the Mexicali Valley. We propose a strategy to define and apply a reference model for situations where the available constraining information is not enough. Our method seems to produce stable and coherent results, as long as the ground resistivity change is able to produce response differences larger than the data uncertainty.",
2197,"An overview on the characteristics and origin of iron-oxide copper gold (IOCG) deposits in China Iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) deposits are a new group of hydrothermal Fe-Cu deposits, the concept of which was recently proposed by Hitzman et al. (1992) initially due to the discovery of the giant Olympic Dam Fe-Cu-U deposit in Australia. Such a definition has triggered new discoveries of similar deposits worldwide, thus attracting extensive concerns from academy and industry societies. Researches on IOCG deposits in China are rare in past few years, and no typical IOCG deposits were reported for a long time until recent. Recent case studies on some Fe-Cu deposits in China have revealed several potential IOCG provinces in China, including the Kangdian in SW China, northern margin of East Junggar and Aqishan-Yamansu (Eastern Tianshan) Fe-Cu belts in East Tianshan, NW China. The Fe-Cu deposits in the Kangdian province are Proterozoic in ages, but involving two mineralization events of similar to 1. 65Ga and similar to 1. 0Ga. Both events are synchronous with within-plate rifting-related magmatism in the region, and thus were considered to be related to continental rifting setting. On the other hand, the Fe-Cu deposits in both the northern margin of Eastern Junggar and Aqishan-Yamansu (Eastern Tianshan) Fe-Cu belts are Plaeozoic in ages, forming at similar to 380Ma and 295 similar to 320Ma, respectively. Geochemical studies on the coeval magmatism in both belts indicated that the Fe-Cu deposits in the northern margin of Eastern Junggar and Aqishan-Yamansu belts have formed during closure of rifting basins in continental margins. The Fe-Cu deposits in the three belts are broadly similar in terms of mineralization styles, such as the hosting rocks as volcanic-sedimentary sequences, a paragenetic sequence of early Fe and late Cu mineralization stages, and no clearly spatial relationships of ore bodies with synchronous intrusions. However, there are also minor differences in terms of alteration and metal assemblages. For example, compared to the other two belts, Fe-Cu deposits in the Kangdian Fe-Cu province were characterized by pre-ore, regional Na alteration, Fe-Na-(Ca) ateration in Fe stage and K-carbonate alteration in Cu stage; by the close associations of ore bodies with breccia pipes; by variably enrichments of REE, Mo, Au and Co; and by a fluid evolution involving magmatic-hydrothermal fluids at early stages and more contributions of nonmagmatic fluids (basinal brines, meteoric water) at late stages. These characteristics of the Kangdian Fe-Cu deposits are similar to those of typical IOCG deposits worldwide (particularly the Precambrian ones) , thus the Kangdian province as typical IOCG province is well recognized in the research society. In contrast, recent studies indicated that Fe-Cu deposits in the northern margin of Eastern Junggar and Aqishan-Yamansu belts were similarly formed during closure of basins in continental margins, and nonmagmatic fluids play relatively important roles on the Fe-Cu mineralization. These studies show that the deposits are more likely comparable with the Mesozoic IOCG deposits in central Andes. However, it is important to note that some of deposits in the two belts contain remarkable, pre-ore skarn-type alteration that is, in few cases, temperally and spatially associated with ore bodies and intrusions, and most of them do not contain a number of metals in addition to Fe and Cu. These features are more or less responsible for the dabate on the affinities of these deposits (IOCG or skarn). In this paper, we have also proposed that some important issues regarding the origin of IOCG deposit in China still desever further studies, including the mechanisms for spatially separation of Fe and Cu mineralization in some deposits and factors controlling enrichments of various elements that have different geochemical behaviors (e. g. , Co-Ni & REE-UMo).",
2198,"Determining behavioral factors for interventions to increase safe water consumption: a cross-sectional field study in rural Ethiopia In developing countries, the lack of safe water options leads to many health risks. In the Ethiopian Rift Valley, most water sources are contaminated with an excess of fluoride. The consumption of fluoride-contaminated water leads to dental and skeletal fluorosis. The article presents an approach to designing community interventions based on evidence from quantitative data. After installing a community filter, a baseline study was conducted in 211 households to survey the acceptance and usage of the filter. To identify important psychological factors that lead to health behavior change, the Risk, Attitude, Norm, Ability, Self-regulation (RANAS) model was taken into account. Descriptive statistics were calculated for behavioral determinants, and their influence on consumption was analyzed with a linear regression. For every behavioral factor, an intervention potential (IP) was calculated. It was found that perceived distance, factual knowledge, commitment, and taste strongly influenced participants consumption behavior and therefore should be tackled for interventions.",
2199,"The roots of environmental micropalaeontology: early inquiries into modern foraminiferal distributions By the late nineteenth century, reports of foraminiferal distributions by pioneers such as Alcide d'Orbigny, Jacob Bailey and Henry Brady led to the realization that benthic foraminiferal populations have a biogeography, and are strongly influenced by water temperatures. Later studies, especially those by Richard Norton and Manley Natland in the 1930s, confirmed the temperature effect. The salinity effect became well known by late 1950s. In the 1950s and 1960s, environmental influences, including that of dissolved oxygen, became clearer with the extensive work of Fred Phleger and associates in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the western North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific Oceans. During this time, Orville Bandy and his students demonstrated severe changes in foraminiferal assemblages at California sewage outfalls. Furthermore, in Argentina, Esteban Boltovskoy confronted questions of species abundances and morphology, as related to natural and anthropogenic environmental constraints. A decade later, George Seiglie recognized anomalous populations and morphological abnormalities in polluted Puerto Rican bays. Thus, today's approach to environmental micropalaeontology, using benthic foraminifera as a tool, was well established by the early 1970s. The emphasis, however, has shifted since then from environmental effects on assemblage characteristics (diversity, dominance, morphological aberrations) to the use of assemblages or species as tracers of environmental changes in historical time.",
2200,"Rural communities' preferences for arsenic mitigation options in Bangladesh In the context of arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh, this paper analyses rural people's preferences for arsenic-free drinking water options. A particular focus is on rural households' willingness to pay for piped water supply which can provide a sustainable solution to the arsenic problem, and how the preference for piped water supply compares with that for various other household/community-based arsenic mitigation technologies. The analysis is based on data collected in a survey of over 2700 households in rural Bangladesh. Six arsenic mitigation technologies were selected for the study: three-kolshi (pitcher) method, activated alumina method (household-based and community-based), dugwell, pond sand filter and deep tubewell (handpump). The survey results indicate that, after taking into consideration the initial and recurring costs, convenience, associated risks and the advantages and disadvantages of each selected technology, the preference of the rural people is overwhelmingly in favor of deep tubewells, followed by the three-kolshi method. The analysis reveals a strong demand for piped water in both arsenic-affected and arsenic-free rural areas, and scope of adequate cost recovery. Between piped water and other arsenic mitigation technologies, the preference of the rural people is found to be predominantly in favor of the former.",
2201,"The effect of nitrite food preservatives added to se'i meat on the expression of wild-type p53 protein This research was conducted using beef extracted from Kupang (se'i meat), Indonesia. Se'i meat is a locally found food where the preferred mode of preparation is smoking the beef with the preservation using nitrites. Nitrite can cause health-related problems such as cancer. This research was carried out using a true experimental method with a complete randomized design with the aim of analyzing the effect of meat administration on the expression of wild-type p53 protein in colon cells of Balb/c mice as an indicator of carcinogenesis. The measurement of p53 is to observe the increase in the-over-capacity of p53 expression in the colon cell as a result of decrease in wild-type protein p53. This research provides scientific information about the effect of giving se'i meat on the expression of wild-type p53 in cells of Balb/c mice as an indicator of carcinogenesis. A total of 36 male mice of Balb/c strain weighing 23.8 g were divided into four groups classified as samples (P1, P2 and P3) and control (K), which were taken from modem and home industries in the city of Kupang. The results showed that consumption of nitrite-preserved beef se'i (traditional smoked meat) increased the p53 protein expression in colon cells of Balb/c strain male mice, and the least significant difference test also showed that there were differences in wild-type p53 protein expression among the four groups: P1 (mice that have been given the standard food, drinking water and se'i meat that contains no nitrite) has an average of 142 expressions, which is higher than that of P3 (mice that have been given the standard food, drinking water and se'i meat containing nitrite which come from the home industry) which has an average of 106.55 expressions and is higher than that of K (mice that have been given the standard food and drinking water) which has the total average of expression of about 78.11 expressions. The benefit of this research is to gain the scientific information about the effect of giving smoked meat on the expression of wild-type p53 in colon cells of Balb/c mice as a carcinogenic indicator.",
2202,"Characterization of Akilbenza clay from Cameroon and its performance for the removal of copper(II) ions from aqueous solution Akilbenza clay (Akil) was characterized by XRD, FT-TIR, XRF, EDX, SEM, and N(2) gas adsorption. The adsorption performance for Cu(II) ions by this clay was also studied. Akil is composed mainly of kaolinite with mica illite and quartz as minor minerals. The ATR-FTIR analysis shows Si-O-Al, Si-O, Al-O, Si-OH, and Al-OH as the main functional groups. SEM indicates that the clay particles are irregular in shape and size by supported BJH. Akil has a specific surface area of 45.62 m(2)/g with the presence of both mesopores and micropores. The average pore diameter is 19.4196 nm. XRF and EDX reveal that the clay is mainly composed of silica, aluminum, and iron with a Si/Al ratio of 1.41. For the adsorption performance of Cu(II) ions, a maximum quantity of 76 mg/g was recorded. Freundlich isotherm models best describe the adsorption processes at equilibrium. Kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption process was well explained with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The value of the mean energy of adsorption from Temkin isotherm and the values from Elovich kinetic model suggest that the adsorption of Copper(II) ions on Akil is a combination between ion exchange and electrostatic attraction. The results obtained can be introduced into the database of knowledge on clay minerals with emphasis on their use for the removal of Cu(II) ions.",
2203,"Impact of green roofs on heavy rainfall in tropical, coastal urban area Green Roofs (GRs) are one of the measures considered for Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigation. The cooling effects of GRs are well studied in the literature. However, previous work has not addressed the impacts of GRs on heavy rainfall in cities. This study develops and tests the hypothesis that incorporating green roofs in urban areas enhances the magnitude of rain for heavy rainfall events. To test this, examples of heavy rainfall events over three different years are examined over Mumbai, India, one of the megapoleis that continues to witness heavy rains and urban flooding. The heavy rain events are simulated using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for different green roof fraction (GF) scenarios (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) over the urban area. The GF simulations are compared to the 'no GF' simulation (control run). The results indicate a consistent increase (1%-72%) in the total accumulated precipitation in all GF scenarios. Additional moisture and increased equivalent potential temperature aided the formation and sustenance of localized pockets of enhanced rain occurrences, contributing to the total amount of rainfall for the rain events for the domain. The increase in rainfall amounts leads to higher runoff and can increase the risk of flash floods. Thus, it is necessary to account for this rainfall-based feedback of GR before adopting it as a mitigation option. The results of this work may be helpful in effective urban planning and managing the urban climate extremes.",
2204,"Role of Short-Term Weather Forecast Horizon in Irrigation Scheduling and Crop Water Productivity of Rice Crop simulation models in conjunction with weather forecasts help in understanding soil-water-plant interactions in real time, and thus in effective management of irrigation water. However, selection of the optimal forecast horizon for use with irrigation scheduling is challenging in the context of uncertainties associated with weather forecasts. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) short-term weather forecasts with different forecast horizons (1, 3, and 5 days) in simulating crop water and yield dynamics of rice. Rule-based irrigation is triggered by specifying thresholds on the current day's ponding depth (d(o)), precipitation (P-o), and evapotranspiration (ETo) as well as their forecast values (Sigma(n)(i=1) P-i; Sigma(n)(i=1) ETi; n = 1, 3, 5). The IMD forecasts of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover were translated into ETo forecasts using the Penman-Monteith equation and region-specific crop coefficients. The Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model was modified to simulate soil-water and plant growth conditions by considering the three forecast scenarios along with conventional irrigation (ignoring weather forecast), and a hypothetical perfect 5-day forecast (reference). Experiments were conducted in four paddy fields in a command area of south India for two monsoon seasons (2018 and 2019) to calibrate and parameterize the SWAP model. The accuracy of forecast variables is increased with increase in length of forecast horizon (root-mean-square error = 12.5 +/- 0.98, skill score = 0.6% +/- 0.03% at 1-day lead to 5.9 +/- 2.5, 22.4% +/- 7.8% at 5-day lead) due to averaging. Conventional irrigation has resulted in the highest use of irrigation water (912 +/- 12.5 mm), percolation losses (1,245 +/- 19.5 mm), and electricity (806.5 +/- 100.5 kW), achieving a low yield (2,331 +/- 138 kg ha(-1)). Irrigation scheduling with 5-day forecast horizon outperformed other scenarios (69% water saving and 23% higher yield), and is slightly inferior to the hypothetical perfect forecast. Our results conclude that IMD forecasts, though moderately reliable at multiple lead times, can serve as a valuable tool in scheduling irrigation activities for sustainable management.

2205,"EVALUATION OF SEFIDROUD RIVER'S REAERATION-RATE COEFFICIENT, IRAN Accurate estimation of the reaeration rate coefficient is very important for the purposes of dissolved oxygen and self-purification modelling in rivers. The main target of this paper is to evaluate 19 commonly used reaeration rate coefficient prediction equations, in Sefidroud River, North of IRAN. In this paper the river's dissolved oxygen has been modelled involving Streeter-Phelps Equation. Then the predicted reaeration rate coefficient results have been compared with four series of collected and recorded data of the river. The studied reach has a length of 110km, including 12 water quality sampling stations along the river and it is extended from downstream of Sefidroud dam to the south coast of Caspian Sea. According to the results, among all equations Parkhurst-Pomeroy equation has shown the most accurate prediction of the reaeration rate coefficient values, with the statistical criteria of Standard Error (SE), Mean Multiplicative Error (MME) and Sum of Square of Residuals (SSR) equal to 0.51, 1.05 and 2.35, respectively. Moreover, results indicate that the river has a high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and as well a low Self-Purification capacity, during September, which is simultaneous with the seepage of non-point agricultural pollutants.",
2206,"Hydrogeochemical evolution and risk assessment of human health in a riverbank filtration site, northeastern China Intensive agriculture and industrial activities have resulted in contamination in rivers and groundwater quality, which threatens human health. In this study, we used comprehensive physiochemical indicators to assess the quality of groundwater used for drinking and irrigation in addition to the potential risks to local residents in a riverbank filtration site. Human health risks through drinking water intake and dermal contact were also estimated. Moreover, we analyzed the spatial distribution regularities of health risk values in a riverbank filtration site. The assessment results revealed that NH4-N, NO2-N, F-, Mn, and As are main contaminants affecting groundwater quality and that 62% of the total samples is suitable for a variety of purposes. All groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation based on the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Na percentage (%Na), and U.S. Salinity Laboratory (USSL) and Wilcox diagrams. The health risk assessment suggests that residents in the study area are at high health risk, and women and children face higher risk than men in both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. The spatial distribution regularities of health risk values suggest that the human health risk value of each groundwater sample is different in the study area and has certain regularity. Therefore, effective measurements must be taken to address the groundwater contamination and to reduce the human health risks.",
2207,"Chloride-binders and their effect on the physico-mechanical properties of sulfate-resisting cement (SRC) hardened pastes upon exposure to sea water attack In Egypt, the national strategic plan for population redistribution supports the establishment of new towns and urban settlements across the coastal zones to relieve the pressure on the packed Nile Valley and Delta and encourages internal migration to new urban coastal communities. Since reinforced concrete has a poor service record in these areas, this situation urged us to design a research program in which a new route has been followed for confronting the concomitant effect of sulfate and chloride attack. Therefore, sulfate-resisting cement (type V) has been used for preparing concrete. The cement has been blended with a chloride-binder for fixing free chloride into an insoluble (or poorly soluble) reaction product. As to the steel reinforcement, the research program will investigate steel protection by an innovative inhibited cement slurry coating. The current-first part-of the research program has been concentrated for determining the influence of a chloride-binder [lead oxide (PbO)] as well as a novel proposed chemical compound [lead nitrate: Pb(NO(3))(2)], as chloride-binders, on the physico-mechanical properties of hardened SRC pastes upon exposure to sea water. The investigation disclosed that these compounds marginally delay the setting time relative to the chloride-binder-free pastes, yet they improve workability, maintain alkalinity (hence carbonation resistance), and yield better compressive strength.",
2208,"Iron and magnesium isotope systematics from the Shuangwang gold deposit in the Qinling Orogen, central China Iron and Magnesium isotopes have been increasingly widely applied to trace mineralization processes of hydrothermal ore systems. In this study, Fe and Mg isotope compositions of whole-rocks, Fe-bearing minerals (pyrite and ankerite) and Mg-bearing mineral (ankerite) from the Shuangwang gold deposits are investigated to evaluate Fe and Mg isotope behaviors in a gold deposit hydrothermal system and provide new constraints on oreforming processes. The results showed that the magmatic rocks in the Shuangwang gold deposit (mainly granodiorite, monzonitic granite and lamprophyre) yielded delta 56Fe values of 0.05-0.10%o and 626Mg values concentrated in a narrow range from -0.23%o to -0.21%o. The gold orebodies are hosted by a NW-trending breccia belt. The wall rock samples (mainly argillaceous limestone, carbonaceous slate and albitite) have higher delta 56Fe values of 0.12-0.29%o and a wide 626Mg range from -2.54%o to -0.35%o. Pyrite mineral separates show larger delta 56Fe variation from -0.44%o to 0.16%o, whereas ankerite has a small delta 56Fe range from -0.15%o to -0.06 and a 626Mg range from -0.66%o to -0.35%o. The crystallization of magmatic rocks incorporated preferentially heavy Fe isotopes, resulting in enrichment of light Fe isotopes in the residual fluid exsolved from magma. The interactions between the wall rocks and the fluids resulted in increase of delta 56Fe value in fluids and resulted in decrease of delta 56Fe value in the wall rocks. However, the fluid still had much lighter Fe isotope composition. Thus, Fe in the main ore-forming stages is regarded as derived from the magmatic stock. The opposite enrichment in Fe isotopes between pyrite and ankerite from stages II and III may be explained by equilibrium Fe isotope fractionation in an open system. In addition, the negative delta 56Fe value in pyrite from stage IV is indicative of the equilibrium between FeS and dissolved Fe in a closed system. The exsolved fluid from magma has Mg isotope composition similar to magmatic rock, and the water-rock reaction led to the enrichment of heavy Fe isotopes in fluid. The evolutions of Mg isotopes in stages II and III precipitation matched well with the prediction of Rayleigh fractionation model. The Mg from wall rocks contributed to the composition of hydrothermal magnesium isotopes during the formation of the Shuangwang gold deposit. A multi-origin is supposed whereby the main stage ore-forming fluids were derived from metamorphic water and were affected by the influx of magmatic water.",
2209,"Systematic review on applicability of magnetic iron oxides-integrated photocatalysts for degradation of organic pollutants in water Owing to biocompatibility, abundance, and low cost, magnetic iron oxides are well suited for the design of efficient and magnetically separable photocatalysts for water treatment. This review presents a detailed survey of magnetic iron oxide-integrated photocatalysts (MIOIPs), in which we have discussed essential conditions needed for designing of efficient MIOIPs for water purification. The synthesis methods and detailed experimental setups for fabrication of MIOIPs were discussed, and the integration manners of iron oxides (Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, and ferrites) with binary, ternary, and quaternary non-magnetic photocatalysts have been categorized. The mechanistic view of enhanced photocatalytic activity caused by different MIOIPs under various light sources was also elaborately argued. The role of various reactive species in photocatalytic oxidative degrading of organic pollutants was investigated. Altogether, this review article has compressively considered and discussed various signs of advancements made toward the synthesis of MIOIPs and their stability, recyclability, and catalytic efficacy for wastewater treatment.

2210,"Hydrogen and syngas production from municipal solid waste (MSW) gasification via reusing CO2 Hydrogen and syngas production from MSW steam gasification with reusing CO2 has been conducted in this study. Two key parameters of gasification temperature and CO2/steam ratio in ranges of 1000-1100 degrees C and 0.5-3 are taken into consideration. The experiments reveal that increasing CO2/steam ratio in the range of 0.5 and 2.5 increases both H(2)and CO molar yield. At the same time, the CO2 conversion efficiency rises. It indicates that Boudouard reaction and water gas reaction proceed independently in the gasification process. With the conditions of CO2/steam ratio = 2.5 and 1000 degrees C, the CO2 conversion efficiency augments to 50.22% and the maximum H-2 molar yield of 18.82 mol/kg-msw can be observed. Under this condition, the highest values of 63.19% for CGE, 0.95 Nm(3)/kg-msw for gas yield and 12.41 MJ/Nm(3) for LHV are obtained. In the steam-only atmosphere, there exist maximum values for H-2 molar yield and gas yield as well. The values of both CGE and CCE are lower than those under the steam-CO2 atmosphere. In conclusion, MSW gasification with the addition of CO2 simultaneously has the advantages of waste-to-energy, reusing CO2 and producing hydrogen and syngas.",
2211,"Distribution and habitats of Corbicula fluminalis africana (Mollusca : Bivalvia) in South Africa An account is given of the geographical distribution and habitats of the South African representative of the genus Corbicula Muhlfeld 1811, formerly known as C. africana (Krauss, 1848) but currently regarded as conspecific with the Asian clam, C. fuminalis (Muller, 1774). Data pertaining to 390 samples of C. fluminalis africana (Krauss, 1848) were extracted from the database of the National Freshwater Snail Collection (NFSC) and statistically analysed. Details of each habitat, as well as mean altitude and mean annual temperature and rainfall for each locality, were processed to determine chi-square and effect size values. An integrated decision tree constructed from the data indicated that temperature, altitude, current speed and type of water-body seemed the more important factors that significantly influenced the distribution of this species in South Africa. In spite of the fact that C. fluminalis africana is relatively widespread in South Africa and was recovered from a wide range of habitat types and water-bodies, it has, to our knowledge, not yet been reported to cause problems in cooling circuits as experienced elsewhere in the world. It is proposed that the feasibility to exploit this species for monitoring heavy metal pollution in freshwater biotopes should be investigated in view of reports from elsewhere in the world that it has the ability to accumulate metals such as copper, lead, zinc and manganese.",
2212,"Radiological and Chemical Risk Assessment due to High Uranium Contents Observed in the Ground Waters of Mansa District (Malwa Region) of Punjab State, India: An Area of High Cancer Incidence High uranium concentration is observed in the underground water samples collected from Mansa district (Malwa region) of Punjab State, India. The uranium content in the underground and public water supply samples ranged from 0.13 to 1340 mu g/l with a mean value of 211.2 mu g/l. Such high values in drinking waters have been earlier observed only in some parts of the world. 81 % of the samples have uranium concentration higher than the recommended guideline value of 30 A mu g/l by the World Health Organization. On the radiological aspect, the range of cancer mortality risk is from 3.68 x 10(-7) to 3.8 x 10(-3) with a mean value of 5.99 x 10(-4) while that of cancer morbidity risk ranged from 5.70 x 10(-7) to 5.87 x 10(-3) with a mean value of 9.26 x 10(-4), which are quite higher than the acceptable level of 10(-4).The chemical toxicity risk (LADD value) was found to range from 0.01 to 101 mu g/kg/day with a mean value of 15.9 mu g/kg/day, which is quite higher than the recommended level of 1 mu g/kg/day by the World Health Organization. The hazard quotient was found to be much greater than 1, indicating that groundwater of this area may not be safe for drinking purposes. Higher contents of uranium in drinking water may be one of the causes for higher degree of cancer incidence in this area of study (Malwa region) as compared to the other regions of the Punjab State and that of the national average.",
2213,"Mapping dynamic histone modification patterns during arsenic-induced malignant transformation of human bladder cells Arsenic is a known potent risk factor for bladder cancer. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations, e.g., DNA methylation and histones posttranslational modifications (PTMs), contribute to arsenic carcinogenesis. Our previous studies have demonstrated that exposure of human urothelial cells (UROtsa cells) to monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), one of arsenic active metabolites, changes the histone acetylation marks across the genome that are correlated with MMA(III)-induced UROtsa cell malignant transformation. In the current study, we employed a high-resolution and high-throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify and quantitatively measure various PTM patterns during the MMA(III)-induced malignant transformation. Our data showed that MMA(III) exposure caused a time-dependent increase in histone H3 acetylation on lysine K4, K9, K14, K18, K23, and K27, but a decrease in acetylation on lysine K5, K8, K12, and K16 of histone H4. Consistent with this observation, H3K18ac was increased while H4K8ac was decreased in the leukocytes collected from people exposed to high concentrations of arsenic compared to those exposed to low concentrations. MMA(III) was also able to alter histone methylation patterns: MMA(III) transformed cells experienced a loss of H3K4me1, and an increase in H3K9me1 and H3K27me1. Collectively, our data shows that arsenic exposure causes dynamic changes in histone acetylation and methylation patterns during arsenic-induced cancer development. Exploring the genomic location of the altered histone marks and the resulting aberrant expression of genes will be of importance in deciphering the mechanism of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.",
2214,"Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by municipal effluent in multiple organs of Wistar rats The aim of this study was to evaluate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in multiple organs of rats induced by municipal effluent released by submarine outfall in city of Santos. A total of 20 male Wistar rats were exposed to effluents by drinking water ad libitum at concentrations of 0, 10, 50, and 100 % for 30 days. Microscopic analysis revealed severe lesions such as necrosis and hemorrhagic areas in liver and kidney from animals exposed to effluent at 50 and 100 % concentration. DNA damage in peripheral blood, liver, and kidney cells were detected by comet assay at higher concentrations of effluent. Moreover, a decrease DNA repair capacity was detected in liver cells. Significant statistical differences (p<0.05) for micronucleated cells from liver were noticed at 50 % concentration of effluent. Taken together, our results demonstrate that municipal effluent is able to induce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in multiple organs of Wistar rats.",
2215,"Quality of the SolimÃµes River water for domestic use by the riverine community situated in Manacapuru-Amazonas-Brazil The Amazon has the largest watershed in the world, with abundant fresh water reserves. Such abundance contrasts with the quality of the water consumed in the riverine communities. This work highlights the importance of assessing the quality of water of the SolimÃµes River in the stretch situated opposite the Community Nossa Senhora das GraÃ§as-Costa do Pesqueiro, in front of the town of Manacapuru-Amazonas-Brazil. The research aimed to evaluate environmental indicators for the quality of the river water as well as in households in this community, according to the regional seasonality. The monitored parameters such as conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, color, pH, nitrate, nitrite, and sulfate were compared with the water quality standards in force in Brazil. Values well above the maximum level allowed (MLA) for color and turbidity parameters were found in some households, indicating that the water collected from the river is not getting appropriate treatment. The analysis of the correlation matrix of the parameters in the flood period of the river evidenced high correlation among dissolved oxygen (D.O), NO3 (-), Cl(-), SO4 (2-), and color. In this study, by principal component analysis (PCA), it was observed that the characteristics of the water, obtained from the river to be consumed in the households, in the flood period showed similarities with the river water samples, indicating absence of efficient treatment for human consumption.",
2216,"Impact of urbanization on groundwater quality: A case study from fast growing city of central India Urbanization, coupled with almost inseparable industrial development, has profound impacts on the hydrological cycle. The increased urbanization is in response to the migration of people from the surrounding rural areas due to higher job opportunities. In developing countries, rapid population growth in urban areas leads to mushrooming of slums, industries with no proper disposal facilities for their effluents, inadequate sewerage systems and unwanted stress on the natural resources. These results in vulnerability of groundwater from open and bore wells to industrial toxicity and anthropogenic input. The present chapter is an attempt to study the impact of urbanization on the groundwater quality in notified slums of Nagpur city of central India. A total of 52 water samples were collected from open wells and 81 from bore wells from various slums of the city and major ion chemistry is carried out to assess the groundwater quality. The TDS concentration is the useful indicator of anthropogenic contamination and in the present area high TDS values are observed. With the increased anthropogenic inputs, the groundwater chemistry changes from a Ca-HCO3 type towards a mixed Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-Cl water types. The nitrate appeared as a major problem of safe drinking water in this region. We recorded highest nitrate concentration up to 411 mg/L in open well and 305 mg/L in bore well. A comparison of groundwater quality in relation to drinking water quality standards revealed that about half of the open well and bore well samples are not suitable for drinking. Our studies shows that groundwater samples from slums with improper sanitation facilities are more polluted than slums with proper sanitation facilities and the groundwater quality of landfill area is worst affected. The study revealed that groundwater quality is deteriorated due to the discharge of effluent from septic tanks, soak pits, pit latrines, discharges of domestic wastewater in leaky drains, animal wastes and leachate from solid waste dumpsite. Based on observed groundwater quality, various mitigation measures are suggested to protect the water resources and further groundwater contamination in the city.

2217,"Preparation of Three Dimensional Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Blend Membranes with Excellent Dye Removal Efficiency and Investigation of Adsorption Mechanism In this work, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes with hydrophilicity as well as preeminent mechanical strength and dye removal efficiency were fabricated by blending with three dimensional hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAPNPs). Surface chemical composition and morphology of the prepared membranes were systematically investigated by ATR-FTIR, XPS, XRD, FESEM, and EDS mapping analyses. The results verified that a large number of HAPNPs were successfully embedded on the modified membrane cross-sections. Moreover, HAPNPs content in the casting solution is an important factor that could have profound influence on the structures and performances of PVDF/HAPNPs blend membranes. The optimal membrane M2 with 2 wt% HAPNPs exhibited excellent hydrophilicity, outstanding mechanical strength of 19.60 MPa, and high water flux of (2466 +/- 31) Lm(-2)h(-1). The maximum static adsorption capacity of the optimal membrane was about 10.83 mg/g, which is 3.75 times that of the pristine PVDF membrane (2.89 mg/g). PVDF/HAPNPs membranes were not only utilized for static adsorption, but also applied to dynamic dye removal. The possible adsorption mechanism between Congo red (CR) and HAPNPs embedded on the blend membranes was firstly discussed in this work. HAPNPs interacted with CR via Lewis reaction, hydrogen bond interaction, as well as electrostatic attraction to achieve the adsorption effect. Herein, the PVDF/HAPNPs blend membranes with extraordinary hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, and dye removal efficiency possess tremendous potential for practical applications of wastewater treatment.",

The spillway section consists often spans, each 18.3m long, provided a with steel crest gates of 18.3m x 8.5m sire and nine sluices 3.0m x 7.6m size. to safely pass 13.57 thousand cumecs discharge: against the inflow design flood of 21.24 thousand cumecs. A 30.5m radius ski-jump bucket with lip angle of 40 degrees at EL 347.5m is provided for energy dissipation. The entire dam rests on hard white quartzitic sandstone continuing at least 39.6m below the river bed at site: and further down the next 122m consists of a series of flaggy sand stones and glauconitic shales, underlain by more than 61m thick Suket shales. The project was commissioned in November, 1960. It generates 115 MW hydropower and augments firm water supply for generation of power in Rana Pratap Sagar Dam and Jawahar Sagar Dam and also for irrigation through Kota Barrage located downstream. Passage of higher floods more than the design discharge caused severe and extensive scours in the river be downstream of bucket. Moreover, Back-water effect of reservoir of Rana Pratap Sagar Dam could nut permit to throw the released water with a free jump for energy dissipation and thereby! caused the discharge jet to be thrown nearby the bucket resulting the under-mining of the bucket lip. This paper describes the geo-physical phenomena of the project; problems developed downstream bed rock of the bucket lip and the remedial measures suggested by Central Water Commission (CWC) to arrest further retrogression of the bed rock and also to prevent from undermining of the spillway bucket.",
2219,"Water-rock interaction and geochemistry of groundwater from the Ain Azel aquifer, Algeria Hydrochemical, multivariate statistical, and inverse geochemical modeling techniques were used to investigate the hydrochemical evolution within the Ain Azel aquifer, Algeria. Cluster analysis based on major ion contents defined 3 main chemical water types, reflecting different hydrochemical processes. The first group water, group 1, has low salinity (mean EC = 735 Î¼S/cm). The second group waters are classified as Cl-HCO(3)-alkaline earth type. The third group is made up of water samples, the cation composition of which is dominated by Ca and Mg with anion composition varying from dominantly Cl to dominantly HCO(3) plus SO(4). The varifactors obtained from R-mode FA indicate that the parameters responsible for groundwater quality variations are mainly related to the presence and dissolution of some carbonate, silicate, and evaporite minerals in the aquifer. Inverse geochemical modeling along groundwater flow paths indicates the dominant processes are the consumption of CO(2), the dissolution of dolomite, gypsum, and halite, along with the precipitation of calcite, Ca-montmorillonite, illite, kaolinite, and quartz.",
2220,"Trace elements in the Lower Pliocene fossiliferous Kangal lignites, Sivas, Turkey The Kangal lignite basin, which is one of the most productive lignite basins in eastern Anatolia-Turkey, includes two lignite seams containing abundant gastropoda. shells in the Lower Pliocene Kalburcayiri Formation. The seams are currently exploited in an open-cast mine in the Kalburcayiri field and supply feed coal to a power plant with 300-MW capacity. The average thickness of each of the two seams in this mine is about 10 m, and they are separated by about 20 m of tuffaceous sedimentary rocks. A 15-20-cm thick tuff bed occurs within the upper seam. The purpose of the study was to understand mineralogy and trace element concentrations of the two lignite seams in the Kalburcayiri Formation which were affected by volcanic ashes. Fifty-nine core samples of the lignites from seven boreholes across the basin, and eight channel samples from the working lignite seams were collected and analysed by proximate analysis, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis techniques. The samples show that the worked lignite seams, on an as-received basis, contain high moisture contents (43.4-57.8%). All the samples on an air-dried basis have high ash yields (from 19.5% to 81.7%) and a broad range of total sulfur contents (from 1.16% to TOM), and calorific values (684 to 4621 kcal/kg), except for two samples with no temperature rise due to high ash yield. The mineral matter of the studied samples is made up of calcite, quartz, feldspar, pyrite, opal-CT, clay minerals, gypsum and traces of aragonite. The trace element analyses, on a whole-coal dry basis, indicate that most of the borehole samples showed enrichment in specific elements, including Zn (15-1394 mug/g), Mo (13-368 mug/g), and U (5.5-131 mug/g), when compared to the range of these elements for most coals in the world. The contents of Zn, Mo, and U for the samples from the worked lignite seams are, respectively, 38-187, 54-161 and 28-55 mug/g. The SEM studies show that Zn is hosted mainly in. micron-sized. Zn-bearing mineral (sphalerite), but no Mo- and U-bearing minerals have been detected during these studies, except for monazites containing Th and U traces. The Mo and U concentrations are negatively correlated with the ash yields, and these elements are contained mainly within organic matter. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
2221,"A 424-year tree-ring-based Palmer Drought Severity Index reconstruction of Cedrus deodara D. Don from the Hindu Kush range of Pakistan: linkages to ocean oscillations The rate of global warming has led to persistent drought. It is considered to be the preliminary factor affecting socioeconomic development under the background of the dynamic forecasting of the water supply and forest ecosystems in West Asia. However, long-term climate records in the semiarid Hindu Kush range are seriously lacking. Therefore, we developed a new tree-ring width chronology of Cedrus deodara spanning the period of 1537-2017. We reconstructed the March-August Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for the past 424 years, going back to 1593 CE. Our reconstruction featured nine dry periods (1593-1598, 1602-1608, 1631-1645, 1647-1660, 1756-1765, 1785-1800, 1870-1878, 1917-1923, and 1981-1995) and eight wet periods (1663-1675, 1687-1708, 1771-1773, 1806-1814, 1844-1852, 1932-1935, 1965-1969, and 1990-1999). This reconstruction is consistent with other dendroclimatic reconstructions in West Asia, thereby confirming its reliability. The multi-taper method and wavelet analysis revealed drought variability at periodicities of 2.1-2.4, 3.3, 6.0, 16.8, and 34.0-38.0 years. The drought patterns could be linked to the large-scale atmospheric-oceanic variability, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and solar activity. In terms of current climate conditions, our findings have important implications for developing drought-resistant policies in communities on the fringes of the Hindu Kush mountain range in northern Pakistan.",
2222,"Arsenic exposure from drinking water and the occurrence of micro- and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes The highest arsenic concentrations in Serbia are measured in drinking water in the Vojvodina Region. The research was designed as a cross-sectional cohort study comprising exposed and unexposed patients with the type 2 diabetes to arsenic in drinking water in Zrenjanin municipality, Serbia. Median life time arsenic exposure from drinking water in exposed group was calculated at 181.00 mu g day(-1) (ranged 1.15-1369.51 mu g day(-1). Multivariate logistic regression model showed significantly higher odds ratio for the occurrence of myocardial infarction and stroke at arsenic concentrations above 10 mu g L-1, while life time arsenic exposure significantly contributed to the occurrence of heart failure. These results support the hypothesis that exposure to arsenic in drinking water may play a role in the occurrence of micro- and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes.",
2223,"Modelling the water balance on farming practices at plot scale: Case study of Tougou watershed in Northern Burkina Faso In the Sahel region, farmers have adopted various farming practices to improve agricultural yields in order to offset an increasingly variable climate regime and the extension of degraded land. This study analyses the functional behaviour of such three selected water-harvesting techniques (stone rows, zaÃ¯ and half-moon) as compared to the traditional tillage method through a comprehensive experimental setup monitored during three consecutive growing seasons (2015â€“2017). The results indicate that these farming practices allow a runoff reduction by 25 to 100%. We propose a continuous model simulating the hydrological dynamics of the farming techniques at plot scale. This model is able to reproduce accurately the observed runoff (R2 = 0.73 âˆ’ 0.95), and gives an insight of the variability of the water storage for each type of techniques in response to the rainfall regime. It appears in particular that zaÃ¯ and half-moons are able to mitigate the effect of dry spells by sustaining available water for crops over extended periods up to three weeks, whereas the direct seeding and stone row techniques rapidly leads to plant water deficit after five days. Even though water infiltration is essentially fostered by surface water retention during rainfall events, our observations suggest that the changes induced to the hydrological dynamics by farming practices also affect soil physical, chemical and biological properties. These effects help completing the explanation of crop yield improvements, but raise some questions of soil evolution and farming practice performances in the long run. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

2225,"Arsenicosis and its relationship with nutritional status in two arsenic affected areas of West Bengal, India Incidence of chronic arsenicosis in the lower Gangetic plain has led to intensive research on arsenic (As) contamination in groundwater and potential health crisis associated with exposure to groundwater As. Arsenic toxicity of local inhabitants and their nutritional status were investigated in two As affected villages (Nonaghata and Doulatpur) of West Bengal, India. Population-based case study on randomly selected subjects was used to assess chronic As exposure through medical evaluation and individual health survey. Groundwater As concentrations were found as high as 870 mu g/L and 1752 mu g/L in Nonaghata and Doulatpur respectively at a depth 50-100 ft. In Nonaghata, 26.7% of people (among 385 surveyed) showed dermatological manifestation and As skin lesions were dominant in age group of 15-30 and 30-45 years old. In both the age groups, cases of melanosis were higher (22.5% and 31.5%) compared to keratosis (15.4% and 12.5%). In Doulatpur 27.4% of people (among 440 surveyed) was found with dermatological manifestations and As skin lesions were dominant in age group of 15-30 and 30-45 years old. Cases of melanosis are higher (27.2% and 31.4%) compared to keratosis (10.8% and 30.7%) in these two age groups. Assessment on calories intake (mainly carbohydrate and protein) by local inhabitants showed that 67.5% and 66.8% people of these two villages belongs to poor nutrition. Assessment of odds ratios (OR) suggested that the stronger associations were with low nutrition which may increase susceptibility to arsenical skin lesions. Thus it is a matter of concern that nutritional status may be an important factor causing prevalence of As toxicity among local inhabitants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2226,"A biblical approach to the reduction of child poverty in Anambra state, Nigeria Child poverty reduction is one of the most important and urgent tasks that requires attention in most regions of the world, nations and Anambra state specifically. The population of impoverished children is progressively increasing in Nigeria because of economic recession and poor security situations that lead to displacement and death of their parents. Although children constitute half of the entire population, commensurate attention is not given to them to match the dimensions of poverty they face. This study argued that child poverty is multidimensional, evidenced in lack of safe drinking water, adequate nutrition, shelter, decent sanitation, medical advice or health services (immunisations) and education, to mention a few. The article highlighted the laudable efforts of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and Anambra government and maintained that multiple strategies can help in solving this problem. To complement these efforts, the enforcement of biblical policies or principles about children's rights would in no small measure reduce child poverty. It was concluded that a proper repositioning of children would be matched with implementation of biblical strategies. Biblical intervention could help children socially, mentally and psychologically and in their general well-being. Biblical principles would erase wrong socio-cultural notions about children.",
2227,"Zinc and glutamine improve brain development in suckling mice subjected to early postnatal malnutrition Objective: The effect of zinc and glutamine on brain development was investigated during the lactation period in Swiss mice. Methods: Malnutrition was induced by clustering the litter size from 6-7 pups/dam (nourished control) to 12-14 pups/dam (undernourished control) following birth. Undernourished groups received daily supplementation with glutamine by subcutaneous injections starting at day 2 and continuing until day 14. Glutamine (100 mM, 40-80 mu L) was used for morphological and behavioral studies. Zinc acetate was added in the drinking water (500 mg/L) to the lactating dams. Synaptophysin and myelin basic protein brain expressions were evaluated by immunoblot. Zinc serum and brain levels and hippocampal neurotransmitters were also evaluated. Results: Zinc with or without glutamine improved weight gain as compared to untreated, undernourished controls. In addition, zinc supplementation improved cliff avoidance and head position during swim behaviors especially on days 9 and 10. Using design-based stereological methods, we found a significant increase in the volume of CA1 neuronal cells in undernourished control mice, which was not seen in mice receiving zinc or glutamine alone or in combination. Undernourished mice given glutamine showed increased CA1 layer volume as compared with the other groups, consistent with the trend toward increased number of neurons. Brain zinc levels were increased in the nourished and undernourished-glutamine treated mice as compared to the undernourished controls on day 7. Undernourished glutamine-treated mice showed increased hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid and synaptophysin levels on day 14. Conclusion: We conclude that glutamine or zinc protects against malnutrition-induced brain developmental impairments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
2228,"Developing conversion and transformation parameters to improve navigation on lower danube In order to improve navigation on the Lower Danube area, some European projects are underway. The focus of FAIRway Danube project (2015-2020) is to provide current and harmonized information about shallow sections, water levels and water level forecasts. Available depths will be used optimally by adapting the location of the waterway to the current riverbed conditions. In parallel, FAIRway Danube is aiming at preparing the harmonized rehabilitation of the Danube and its navigable tributaries. The bilateral conventions and agreements signed by Romania and Bulgaria, as well as between AFDJ Galati (Romania) and IAPPD Ruse (Bulgaria), establish the responsibilities for maintaining the appropriate airworthiness conditions from km 845 to km 375. The authorities of both states have agreed to significantly improve airworthiness in the Danube section, their intention being to minimize as much as possible periods of time when commercial navigation is not possible: both during the winter, when ice climbs occur, and in summer when the Danube level is very low. As a support of the FAIRway Danube project, geodetic activities in that area included in last years geodetic observations (GNSS, leveling, bathymetry, Lidar). Previous geodetic studies established connections between CRS (Coordinate Reference Systems). If 2D connections are more easily to be established, the height connection between the old and new CRS on the left and right bank of the Lower Danube are more difficult to be established. The present study shows a way to be able to transform the heights from this area between different reference systems (Black Sea, Baltic Sea, EVRF). As a final product, a quasigeoid model and a sofware were realized and implemented at AFDJ Galati and IAPPD Ruse. Â© SGEM2019. All Rights Reserved.",
2229,"Energy and environmental issues for Jordan Jordan possesses only relatively small reserves of crude oil and natural gas. Consequently the amount of hard currency spent on imported oil and petroleum products (i.e. similar to 500 US$ million in the year 1995) is equivalent to almost half of that earned from exported domestic commodities. Given that the national rates of energy and electricity consumption will most probably double within 15 years from that for the year 1995 (i.e. the expected annual primary-energy demand will be approximately 8 million toe in the year 2010), any increase in crude-oil unit prices will threaten significantly the security of energy supplies to the country and hence the quality of life. There are several options for Jordan to avoid this situation: for instance, accelerating the efforts devoted to the exploration and harnessing of indigenous energy resources such as oil shale, implementing energy-thrift and better long-term environmental planning; as well as the gradual introduction domestically of more economic unit-energy pricing. The rapidly increasing population (i.e. by similar to 4.5% annually), and recent developments in housing, agriculture as well as industrial and commercial activities, combined with a lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework have led to adverse impacts on the environment. improving the average standard and quality of living of Jordanian citizens and protecting the environment can be accomplished by the integration of environmental, social and economic goals in development planning and implementation processes, so ensuring increased effectiveness and efficiency of resource use, and stabilising the population. Radically improved water-management is also a major challenge for Jordan, because of the limited amounts of potable fresh-water resources. In 1995, on average only one-fifth, i.e. similar to 200m(3) per capita-annum, of the World Bank water-scarcity criterion was available. In the year 2010, this rate is expected to be as low as similar to 100m(3) per capita-annum due to the likely doubling of the population. A pragmatic long-term management strategy needs to be implemented in order to reduce water losses, deal with water pollution, and enhance the harnessing of water from non-conventional sources.

2230,"Numerical Simulation of Water Table Drawdown due to Groundwater Pumping in a Contaminated Aquifer System at a Shooting Test Site, Pocheon, Korea The study area has been contaminated with explosive materials and heavy metals for several decades. For the design of the pump and treat remediation method, groundwater flow before and during groundwater pumping in a contaminated aquifer system was simulated, calibrated, and predicted using a generalized multidimensional hydrological numerical model. A three-dimensional geologic formation model representing the geology, hydrogeology, and topography of the aquifer system was established. A steady-state numerical simulation with model calibration was performed to obtain initial steady-state spatial distributions of groundwater flow and groundwater table in the aquifer system before groundwater pumping, and its results were illustrated and analyzed. A series of transient-state numerical simulations were then performed during groundwater pumping with the four different pumping rates at a potential location of the pumping well. Its results are illustrated and analyzed to provide primary reference data for the pump and treat remediation method. The results of both steady-state and transient-state numerical simulations show that the spatial distribution and properties of the geologic media and the topography have significant effects on the groundwater flow and thus depression zone.",
2231,"Lead remediation of contaminated water using Moringa Stenopetala and Moringa oleifera seed powder The increasing influx of heavy metals into water bodies from industrial, agricultural, and domestic activities is of global concern because of their well documented negative effects on human and ecosystem health. A recent study of streams in Blantyre and Zomba, Malawi revealed lead levels of up 0.118 mg/L, exceeding the World Health Organisation acceptable level of 0.01 mg/L. Our ongoing study on low cost effective heavy metal remediation techniques in developing countries has already demonstrated that Moringa oleifera, the well known source of natural water clarifiers, is effective in heavy metal detoxification of water. This paper presents the first reported use of a related species, the African moringa, Moringa stenopetala for lead detoxification and preliminary investigation of the interaction of the metal with the polyelectrolytes of M. oleifera and stenopetala. The potential of M. stenopetala for lead removal was tested by means of jar tests. With an initial lead concentration of 7 ppm, M. stenopetala seed powder, at doses of 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00 and 2.50 g/100mL, reduced the concentration of lead by 20.00 Â± 0.00, 46.19 Â± 2.06, 71.19 Â± 2.06 and 89.43 Â± 0.60 and 96.23 Â± 0.12 % respectively. M. stenopetala was more effective than M. oleifera in removing lead from water (p=0.001 at 95% confidence level). For oleifera, lead levels decreased exponentially during the first 5 h. of the reaction and then equilibrium was established; for stenopetala, a linear decrease was observed. The pH of the mixture rose from 2.30 to a maximum of 2.53 and 2.57 and then fell to an equilibrium value of 2.30 and 2.29 for oleifera and stenopetala respectively. Lead removal was also affected by pH, ionic strength, and water hardness. Our results show that M. stenopetala has potential in lead remediation of contaminated waters. Further studies are being carried out on remediation of other metals and the mechanism of the metal moringa interaction. Â© Spring 2006.",
2232,"Heavy metal contamination assessment of groundwater quality: a case study of Oti landfill site, Kumasi Environmentally friendly municipal solid waste management is the biggest problem facing several developing countries, including Ghana. Heavy metals pollution generated by landfill leachate has become increasingly concerned due to its potential impact on human health. This study assessed the pollution level and sources of heavy metal levels in groundwater, as well as evaluated the human health risk effect. The sampling technique and sample treatment were done based on the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. The results suggested that the mean concentration of Pb, Fe, Cd, and Cr was above the acceptable limits of the World Health Organization for drinking water except for Zn and Cu. The heavy pollution index indicates contamination, while hazard index values at sites BH1 and W-4 were greater than one, suggesting adverse health effects. However, the heavy metal pollution index values were less than the critical limit of 100 for drinking water. Multivariate analysis predicted that lithogenic and anthropogenic factors were the possible sources of water pollution of heavy metal in the Oti community. Thus, multivariate statistical techniques could be a beneficial tool for the evaluation of possible sources of heavy metal contamination. The high levels of heavy metals found in the Oti community suggested a considerable pollution of water by leachate percolation from the landfill site. The findings of the study, which can be used in areas under similar environmental conditions, can offer a valuable benchmark for the design of suitable approaches to manage groundwater resources by both local and national policymakers.",
2233,"A novel chemosensor for Fe3+ based on open-closed-loop mechanism and imaging in living cells In this paper, a novel chemosensor (named L1) for Fe3+ based on the rhodamine 6G and o-vanillin has been synthesized, which can selectively recognize Fe3+. The L1 solution showed a distinguishable colour change by naked eye, and the fluorescence turns on response after the addition of Fe3+. In addition, the experimental results showed that the spirocyclic of L1 was opened by cooperation between L1 and Fe3+, and then the fluorescence emission after excitation of the mixture solution was detected with the change in solution colour. The complexation coefficient of L1 towards Fe3+ was 1:1. Furthermore, L1 for Fe3+ sensing had a remarkable low detection limit of 427 nM (UV) and 130 nM (fluorescence), which is far below the drinking water standards (0.3 mg/L) of China. Meanwhile, the in vivo imaging and cell viability assay experiments demonstrated that L1 could be used for sensing Fe3+ in vivo.",
2234,"Enhanced Adsorption of p-Arsanilic Acid from Water by Amine-Modified UiO-67 as Examined Using Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Density Functional Theory Calculations p-Arsanilic acid (p-ASA) is an emerging organoarsenic pollutant comprising both inorganic and organic moieties. For the efficient removal of p-ASA, adsorbents with high adsorption affinity are urgently needed. Herein, amine-modified UiO-67 (UiO-67-NH2) metal organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized, and their adsorption affinities toward p-ASA were 2 times higher than that of the pristine UiO-67. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results revealed adsorption through a combination of As-O-Zr coordination, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi it stacking, among which As-O-Zr coordination was the dominant force. Amine groups played a significant role in enhancing the adsorption affinity through strengthening the As-O-Zr coordination and pi-pi stacking, as well as forming new adsorption sites via hydrogen bonding. UiO-67-NH(2)s could remove p-ASA at low concentrations (<5 mg L-1) in simulated natural and wastewaters to an arsenic level lower than that of the drinking water standard of World Health Organization (WHO) and the surface water standard of China, respectively. This work provided an emerging and promising method to increase the adsorption affinity of MOFs toward pollutants containing both organic and inorganic moieties, via modifying functional groups based on the pollutant structure to achieve synergistic adsorption effect.",
2235,"DOES THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC GOODS CORRESPOND TO LOCAL DEMAND? Recently China's central government has promoted public goods investment in pursuit of rural development and poverty reduction. However, the top down nature of investment planning may lead to mismatches between public goods projects and the demands of local residents. Using village- and household-level survey data, this study seeks to identify the determinants of project implementation, focusing on investments in roads, drinking water, and irrigation. Contrary to some popular perception, our results suggest symmetry between farmers' reported demand and the types of projects implemented in their villages. The relative contribution of local demand to project implementation is seen to vary, however, across different types of public goods. (JEL D71, H41, H77, P35)",

2237,"Structural control on the occurrence of groundwater in granite gneissic terrain, Purulia, West Bengal Purulia, one of the most drought prone districts of West Bengal, India, is geologically a part of Chotanagpur Gneissic Complex and is mainly a granite gneissic terrain. Scarcity of drinking water has always been a major concern in the area. Thus, a hydrogeological study was carried out in and around Purulia I and Purulia II blocks of the district during lean season. The main objective of the study is to determine the structural control on groundwater flow so that groundwater extraction can be optimised economically in the area. For the purpose, depth to water level zonation map was prepared with flow direction. The lineament data was obtained by analysing satellite imagery of the area and was cross-checked using field data. The orientation of the major joint sets is NE-SW and NW-SE in this area. The NW-SE trending fractures act as conduits and facilitate the flow, while NE-SW trending fractures act as an obstruction to the flow. The lineament density of the area was overlaid on depth to water level map using Surfer and it is observed where fractures form a network, water occurs at shallow level, while in places where fractures are isolated, water flows down to deeper levels. It was interpreted from all the observations that the flow of groundwater in this area depends on the distribution of joints, thus subsurface water being structurally controlled. This type of study has been carried out in various parts of the world but in Purulia district of West Bengal, India, structural control on the occurrence of subsurface water has not yet been established through any major studies. This study will help in divulging structural control on groundwater in this area and identification of areas where constructing tubewells will help in economical extraction of groundwater.",
2238,"The role of cropping system adjustment in balancing grain yield and groundwater use across a rainfall gradient in the North China Plain under future climate scenarios* The long-term extraction of groundwater for crop irrigation under the high-yielding double-cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize over the last decades has led to rapid depletion of groundwater in the North China Plain (NCP). In this study, we used the well-validated APSIM model to evaluate the yield and water use of the current cropping system and three alternative cropping systems under future climate scenarios. We used a statistical downscaling method to downscale the monthly climate data from the 33 global climate models to the daily data for driving the APSIM model. The results show that future climate change would mainly have a negative impact on the maize yield, but it has a positive impact on the wheat yield under most future climate scenarios. The combined effects of the reduction of crop water consumption and the relative increase in rainfall under the future climate scenarios will alleviate the situation of groundwater overexploitation. Moreover, the amount of groundwater overdraft under the future climate scenarios mainly depends on the selected alternative cropping system and the amount of local rainfall. The results provide useful information that helps adjust cropping systems to stop groundwater depletion and maintain acceptable food production levels in the NCP.",
2239,"Modeling water crossings leading to the arrival of early Homo in Sulawesi, Indonesia, via paleoclimate drift experiments Lithic tools found at Talepu, Sulawesi, in Wallacea suggest that an unknown hominin occupied Sulawesi between similar to 118-194 ka. The Philippines, Borneo, and Flores are identified as possible sources of the colonizing hominin. Climatic reconstructions indicate that the period between similar to 118-194 ka was marked by large variation in sea level in Wallacea, with portions of the Sunda shelf exposed at low sea level but with coastlines and land extent comparable to that of the present day at high sea level stages. A series of simulated 30-day oceanic drift experiments are conducted to determine which of the three proposed regions would be the most likely origin for hominin dispersal to Sulawesi. Drifts are simulated for low and high sea level cases. Present day sea level, winds and currents from atmosphere and ocean reanalysis products are used as proxy of environmental conditions during high sea level states. Output from Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 21 ka) simulations generated by three paleoclimate models is used to reconstruct the environment during low sea level conditions. Simulated drifters are released from multiple locations within three possible source regions: Borneo, Mindanao (Philippines) and the Banda Arc (including Flores). Probabilities of success and trip durations of direct arrivals as well as islandhops to Sulawesi are calculated. Results indicate that crossings are facilitated by low sea level, but the possibility of crossings at high sea level cannot be discarded. All of the three analyzed departure areas could be considered feasible sources for arrivals at Sulawesi but, Borneo is by far the most likely source area and Mindanao departures more likely to arrive in Sulawesi than those from the Banda Arc. The shortest simulated period voyagers would have to survive at sea are 3-8 days, 14-19 days and 12-20 days for Borneo, Mindanao and Band Arc departures respectively. These results have implications for the trajectory of hominin evolution in the region, including inputs to modern human diversity.",
2240,"Anomalous circulation patterns in association with two types of daily precipitation extremes over southeastern China during boreal summer Based on the daily rainfall data from China Meteorological Administration, the tropical cyclone (TC) best track data from Japan Meteorological Agency, and the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data from NOAA, regional mean daily precipitation extreme (RDPE) events over southeastern China (specifically, the Fujian-Jiangxi region (FJR)) and the associated circulation anomalies are investigated. For the summers of 1979-2011, a total of 105 RDPE events are identified, among which 35 are TC-influenced (TCIn-RDPE) and 70 are TC-free events (TCFr-RDPE). Distinct differences between these two types of RDPEs are found in both their statistical features and the related circulation patterns. TCFr-RDPEs usually occur in June, while TCIn-RDPEs mainly take place during July-August. When TCFr-RDPEs happen, a center of the anomalous cyclonic circulation is observed over the FJR, with an anomalous anticyclonic circulation to the south of this region. The warm/moist air flows from the South China Sea (SCS) and western Pacific meet with colder air from the north, forming a narrow convergent belt of water vapor over the FJR. Simultaneously, positive diabatic forcing anomalies are observed over the FJR, whereas negative anomalies appear over both its south and north sides, facilitating the formation and maintenance of the cyclonic circulation anomaly, as well as the upward motion of the atmosphere, over the FJR. When TCIn-RDPEs occur, southeastern China is dominated by a TC-related stronger anomalous cyclonic circulation. An anomalous anticyclonic circulation in the mid and high latitudes north of the FJR exists in the mid and upper troposphere, opposite to the situation during TCFr-RDPE events. Abundant warm/wet air is carried into the FJR from both the Indian Ocean and the SCS, leading to a large amount of latent heat release over the FJR and inducing strong ascending motion there. Furthermore, large differences are also found in the manifestation of Rossby wave energy propagation between these two types of RDPE events. The results of this study are helpful to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind these two types of RDPE events.",
2241,"Preliminary clinical investigation on fluoride contamination in Nalhati sub-division (West Bengal); possible structural changes of water due to fluoride ion and related clinical aspects Fluorosis is widely prevalent in Nalhati in Bhirbhum District. Attempts were made for a preliminary study on the clinical aspects of fluorosis in fluoride affected victims in Nalhati. Though the tap water is relatively free from fluoride contamination but fluoride concentrations in urine were found to be appreciably high. The victims suffered abnormally high alkaline phosphatase and high values of AST (GOT) but low calcium levels in serum leading to calcium loss, renal insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency and bone diseases of low to severe magnitudes. Efforts have been made to throw light on structural changes of water due to fluoride contamination and other related aspects.",
2242,"Cyanotoxin contamination of semiarid drinking water supply reservoirs Changing global climatic conditions and the continuous eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems have led to increased frequency, duration and toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms worldwide. This makes the provision of time series information on cyanotoxins extremely crucial for effective monitoring and management of water resources. The objective of the present study was to investigate seasonal and annual changes in microcystins (MCs), cylindrospermopsins (CYNs), saxitoxins (STXs), neo-saxitoxin (neo-STX) and anatoxin-a (ATX-a) concentrations in 11 public water supply reservoirs in the semiarid region of Brazil, from 2004 to 2011. Per time, at least one cyanotoxin was present in all the investigated reservoirs. High levels of MCs, CYNs, STXs and Neo-STX were detected simultaneously in Carpina, Duas Unas, Ipojuca, and Jucazinho reservoirs. All the investigated reservoirs had significant concentrations of MCs. The highest levels of MCs were found in Carpina (303,300.0 ng g(-1)) and Duas Unas (122,053.9 ng g(-1)) reservoirs, while the lowest concentration of the hepatotoxins was recorded in Ipojuca (10.3 ng g(-1)) reservoir. On the other hand, CYN was detected in four reservoirs, STXs and Neo-STX in ten reservoirs and ATX-a in two reservoirs. The first record of CYN in Carpina reservoir was obtained in 2006. In addition, Carpina reservoir had the highest concentration of STXs and Neo-STX in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. The high concentration of cyanotoxins observed in most samples obtained from semiarid reservoirs in Brazil demonstrates the need for regular monitoring and updated management programs.",
2243,"Artificial ripening of 'Shiraz' persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb. cv. Shiraz) prior to marketing Although persimmon is one of the traditional fruits in Iran, production is only 7320 tons. Persimmon consumption has been decreasing because of consumers' adverse reaction to the astringency of Iranian cultivars and this has led to a decrease in cultivated area. Also both growers and handler's lack knowledge about how to remove astringency before sending fruit to the market. This study was carried out to develop a simple and economical method for removing astringency of local cultivars that could be recommended to the industry. Fruit of a local cultivar (cv. Shiraz) in Fars province, Iran were harvested at commercial maturity (breaker stage). Fruit were dipped in ethanol (20, 35 and 50%), acetic acid (3, 6 and 10%), commercial vinegar, hot water (50 degrees C) or tap water (as a control) for 30 min. Total soluble solids (TSS), vitamin C, total acid, pH and tannic acid of treated fruit were measured at 4 day intervals after storage in common local stores. Vitamin C and TSS were highest in the ethanol 20%, hot water and ethanol 35% treatments respectively. Total acid was highest in 10% and 6% acetic acid treatments. Tannins were highest in the control treatment and lowest in ethanol 20%, hot water followed by ethanol 35% treatments. Fruit juice pH was also highest in ethanol 20%, 35% and hot water respectively. Although tannic acid and total acid decreased during storage, fruit juice pH and total soluble solids increased. Weight loss was least in ethanol 20, 35, 50% and hot water treatments respectively. These results suggest that a pre-storage treatment with hot water has potential to reduce astringency of 'Shiraz' persimmon before a short storage period and supply to markets.",
2244,"Prediction of Topsoil Texture Through Regression Trees and Multiple Linear Regressions Users of soil survey products are mostly interested in understanding how soil properties vary in space and time. The aim of digital soil mapping (DSM) is to represent the spatial variability of soil properties quantitatively to support decision-making. The goal of this study is to evaluate DSM techniques (Regression Trees - RT and Multiple Linear Regressions - MLR) and the ability of these tools to predict mineral fraction content under a wide variability of landscapes. The study site was the entire Guapi-Macacu watershed (1,250.78 km(2)) in the state of Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast region of Brazil. Terrain attributes and remote sensing data (with 30 m of spatial resolution) were used to represent landscape co-variables selected as an input in predictive models in order to develop the explanatory variables. The selection of sampling sites was based on the Latin Hypercube algorithm. A representative set of one hundred points with feasible field access was chosen. Different input databases were tested for prediction of mineral fraction content (harmonized and original data). The Spline algorithm was used to harmonize data according to the GlobalSoil. Net consortium standards. The results showed better performance from the RT models, using input from an average of six covariates; the simplest MLR model used twice as many input variables, creating more complex models without gaining precision. Furthermore, better R-2 values were obtained using RT models, irrespective of harmonization of soil data. The harmonized dataset from the 0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.15 m layers, in general, presented better results for the clay and silt, with R2 values of 0.52 (0.00-0.05 m) and 0.69 (0.05-0.15 m), respectively. Prediction of sand content showed better results when the original depth data was used as an input, although all regression tree models had R2 values greater than 0.52. The RT models provided a better statistical index than MLR for all predicted properties; however, the variance between models suggests similarity of performance. Regarding harmonization of soil data, both input databases (harmonized or not) can be used to predict soil properties, since the variance of model performance was low and generalization of the soil maps showed similar trends. The products obtained from the digital soil mapping approach make it possible to integrate the factor of uncertainties, providing easier interpretation for soil management and land use decisions.",
2245,"A Review of Shale Gas Exploitation Technology The United States has taken the lead to achieve the shale gas industrial production and created a shale gas revolution throughout the world. According to the exploitation experience of the United States, the key of shale gas business development realization is to adopt horizontal well combined with fracturing technology. At present fracturing technology used commonly include multi-stage fracturing, water fracturing, refracturing, etc. China has great potential in shale gas resource, recoverable resources has 25.08x10(12) m(3), but they are mainly located in the drought and water lack area, and the clay mineral content for shale gas reservoir is higher, the traditional water-based fracturing fluid used for shale gas development caused a lot of water consumption and serious reservoir damage, therefore, it is not suitable for shale gas reservoir conditions in China. In the process of domestic shale gas development, exploring novel fracturing and development technology is irreversible.",

2247,"A novel interfacial thermodynamic model for predicting solubility of nanoparticles coated by stabilizers To improve the stability of nanoparticles in aqueous solution, polymer or surfactant, etc. are often added in solutions during the preparation process of nanoparticles, which can induce new interfaces that influence the solubility of nanoparticles. In this work, a novel interfacial thermodynamic model for describing the Gibbs energy of the nanoparticles coated by stabilizers was proposed to predict the solubility of nanoparticles. Within the developed model, the activity coefficient of nano metal system was determined by Davies model and that of nano drug system by Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT). The Gibbs energy of the interface was established as a function of molecular parameters via the application for nano metal system. Furthermore, the model was further used to predict the solubility of nano drugs itraconazole, fenofibrate, and griseofulvin. It was found that the Gibbs energy of the interface plays an important role especially when the radius of nano metal is less than 40 nm, and the developed model can predict the solubility of nano drug with high accuracy in comparison with the experimental data as well as predict the changing trend of solubility of nano drugs that increases as the particle size decreases. Meanwhile, the stabilization mechanism of stabilizers on nano drugs was studied which provided theoretical guidance for the selection of polymer or surfactant stabilizer. These findings showed that the developed model can provide a reliable prediction of the solubility of nanoparticles and help to comprehend the stabilization mechanism of the stabilizers on nano drugs with different particle sizes, which is expected to provide important information for the design of nano drugs formulations.

2248,"Human helminth co-infection: analysis of spatial patterns and risk factors in a Brazilian community BACKGROUND: Individuals living in areas endemic for helminths are commonly infected with multiple species. Despite increasing emphasis given to the potential health impacts of polyparasitism, few studies have investigated the relative importance of household and environmental factors on the risk of helminth co-infection. Here, we present an investigation of exposure-related risk factors as sources of heterogeneity in the distribution of co-infection with Necator americanus and Schistosoma mansoni in a region of southeastern Brazil. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional parasitological and socio-economic data from a community-based household survey were combined with remotely sensed environmental data using a geographical information system. Geo-statistical methods were used to explore patterns of mono- and co-infection with N. americanus and S. mansoni in the region. Bayesian hierarchical models were then developed to identify risk factors for mono- and co-infection in relation to community-based survey data to assess their roles in explaining observed heterogeneity in mono and co-infection with these two helminth species. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The majority of individuals had N. americanus (71.1%) and/or S. mansoni (50.3%) infection; 41.0% of individuals were co-infected with both helminths. Prevalence of co-infection with these two species varied substantially across the study area, and there was strong evidence of household clustering. Hierarchical multinomial models demonstrated that relative socio-economic status, household crowding, living in the eastern watershed and high Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were significantly associated with N. americanus and S. mansoni co-infection. These risk factors could, however, only account for an estimated 32% of variability between households. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that variability in risk of N. americanus and S. mansoni co-infection between households cannot be entirely explained by exposure-related risk factors, emphasizing the possible role of other household factors in the heterogeneous distribution of helminth co-infection. Untangling the relative contribution of intrinsic host factors from household and environmental determinants therefore remains critical to our understanding of helminth epidemiology.",
2249,"Distribution of Heavy Metal Contents and Chemical Fractions in Anaerobically Digested Manure Slurry Digested slurry samples from twenty-one large-scale anaerobic digestion plants together with intensive pig and dairy farms in Jiangsu Province of China were collected and analyzed for total and dissolved concentrations of Zn, Cu and As, as well as chemical characteristics. The results showed that total concentrations of Zn, Cu and As in digested pig slurries were concentrated to < 10, < 5 and 0.02-0.1 mg/l, respectively; while < 2 and 10-30, < 1, and 0.02-0.1 mg/l, respectively, in digested dairy slurries. Lowering the dietary supply of these elements to pig and dairy would be the most effective way to control heavy metal contents in digested manure slurries. Dissolved fractions of Zn, Cu and As accounted for 1-74%, 1-33% and 2-53% of the total concentrations, respectively, in digested pig slurries; and 18-65%, 12-58% and 3-68% in digested dairy slurries. The chemical fractions of heavy metals in digested slurries were not only dependent on the total concentrations of heavy metals in raw manures but also on conditions of digestion and storage. Oxidation pond systems could significantly cripple the total contents of heavy metals in digested slurries, and the removal effect was better in multi-oxidation-pond systems than that in primary-oxidation-pond systems. However, the chemical fractions of heavy metals in digested slurries changed in a complicated manner when stored in oxidation ponds, due to the suspended solid deposition, elements reduction, as well as variations of pH values and oxidation-reduction potential.",
2250,"Optimal application of irrigation water with drip-tape method for Pashmineh Zar croplands, Andimeshk, Southwest Iran A new generation of drip irrigation pipes was innovated a few years ago that revolutionized the pressurized irrigation technology and was known later as Drip Tape Irrigation Technique. The manufacturing of these pipes began in Iran in 1997 by Super Drip International Co. of the successful irrigation projects executed in Khuzestan Province, southwest Iran, using drip tape method was the Pashmineh Zar project in the city of Andimeshk with an area of 50 ha. The method has numerous advantages including high efficiency (almost 90%), lower performance pressure, lacking of need for ground leveling, light weight, ease of transportation and installation and lower cost as compared with classical drip systems. Regarding the studies carried out on the pressurized irrigation systems in Khuzestan province, the drip tape irrigation scheme in Pashmineh Zar area can be considered as a successful project in encouraging farmers to use the system. The success of this scheme can be attributed to the followings: 1) selection of the suitable location in terms of slope, climate, soil texture and structure, high soil permeability, soil fertility and high quality water in the region, 2) using local labor force, especially women, 3) experienced operating company in pressurized irrigation field, 4) using standard equipment, 5) using developed storage and nursery systems, 6) applying appropriate managerial practices in operating the scheme and 7) efficient marketing in exporting of the produced crops. Totally, in the drip tape system the water use efficiency (WUE) is significantly higher in comparison to the surface irrigation method so that the WUE of 2.7 kg per cubic meter for the lettuce in surface method was raised to 7.3 kg per cubic meter by drip tape method. Also, the uniformity of the water distribution along the lateral pipes with 150 in long was almost 98%. The conclusions of this study point to the fact that the ultimate success of the Pashminch Zar project can be related to the effective operational management which is the missing part in most of the pressurized irrigation schemes and has been neglected by solely focusing on the ending of the project and not achieving the set operational purposes. It is thus recommended that, firstly, the current potentials in the Khuzestan province for the execution of pressurized irrigation systems be identified through comprehensive research projects and, secondly, the operational management of the irrigation schemes in the area be conducted by a highly effective managerial crew in order to reduce the operational problems of the installed systems, raise the total performance efficiency and cope with the current water crisis in the region.",
2251,"Using Future Scenario Planning as a tool for informed decision making on infrastructure interventions in Kibera, Nairobi in Kenya This paper focuses on the use of Future Scenario Planning and an adaptation of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework as analysis tools for informed decision-making in a community workshop. The aim of this methodology was to assess the perceived impacts of two infrastructure interventions for flood mitigation (local drainage improvement and local flood protection by gabions along the river edges) in the Andolo community in Kibera, Nairobi, in Kenya. Future Scenario Planning was used as a visualisation method for the changes each intervention could bring to the community and the perceived impacts were measured using the assets component of the British Department for International Development (DFID)'s Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. The exercise was delivered as a two-day workshop, which ensured community engagement and facilitated co-decision making of an infrastructure intervention. The process was helpful to ensure sustainability in the use and maintenance of a public space, as well as for initiating conversations within the community regarding critical infrastructure and prioritisation of interventions for mitigating immediate risks.",

The process was followed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) for trace determination of lead. Tropaeolin OOO was used as the chelating agent for lead(II). The analytical conditions for the quantitative recoveries of lead(II) were investigated. Lead (II) - Tropaeolin 000 chelate was quantitatively extracted to 200 mu L of CCl4 at pH 4. The limit of detection (LOD) was 11.4 mu g L-1. The recovery tests from the certified reference materials TMDA 64.2 and TMDA 53.3 Water Samples were in good agreement. The microextraction procedure showed applicability to wastewater and hair samples obtained from Kayseri, Turkey.",
2253,"Two generations of garnets and their relevance for the hydrothermal fluid evolution of the Hongyuntan deposit, NW China The Hongyuntan deposit, which is one of the typical volcanic-hosted Fe deposits in the Aqishan-Yamansu metallogenic belt of the Eastern Tianshan Orogenic Belt, primarily consists of Fe and skarn minerals (especially garnet). Two generations (three types) of garnets were identified in the Hongyuntan deposit based on field and optical characteristics. Hongyuntan garnets are Fe-rich and belong to the grossular-andradite solid solution series (And = 50.99%-100.00%, average: 79.06%). Garnets of the first generation (Grtl) are massive aggregates and are fine-grained with well-developed oscillatory zonings. They have Type I (two-phase liquid and vapor) and Type II (multi-phase daughter mineral-bearing) fluid inclusions and experienced high temperature (540-560 degrees C) and salinity (9.2-63.2 wt% NaCl eqv) conditions. The Grt1 have high Sigma REE, LfREE/HREE, delta Eu, U, Y, and high field strength element (HFSE: sum of Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf) contents. Garnets of the second generation (Grt2) are vefin types and are characterized by irregular shapes with irregular zonings. Type A garnets of the second generation (Grt2-A) usually coexist with mafgnetite and have Type I and Type II fluid inclusions with relatively high temperature (480-500 degrees C) and salinity (9.5-36.6 wt% NaCl eqv) values. Compared to Grtl, Grt2-A have low And, U, and LREE/HREE together with medium Sigma REE, delta Eu, HFSE, and Y contents. Type B garnets of the second generation (Grt2-B) usually coexist with epidote and quartz. They merely have Type I fluid inclusions with medium-low temperature (260-280 degrees C) and salinity (6.6-12.7 wt% NaCl eqv) values. Grt2-B have high And, delta Eu, and LREE/HREE contents but very low Sigma REE, HFSE, and Y contents. The fluid inclusions and geochemical properties of the garnets indicate that the temperature, salinity, oxygen fugacity (fO(2)), and pH of the ore-forming fluid fluctuated, indicating Hongyuntan deposit likely experienced superimposed mineralization. Grt1 originated in a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid and formed through diffusive metasomatism under relatively high fO(2), neutral pH, and low water/rock (W/R) ratio conditions. The reduced Fe and other siderophile elements in the ore-forming fluid, which formed Grtl, are believed to be the material basis for iron ores in the later main metallogenic stage. Grt2-A demonstrate the characteristics associated with transitional fluid, which most likely originated from the episodic hydrothermal supplies. However, the oreforming fluid system gradually opened up during the crystallization of Grt2-B, and the decreasing temperatures and depletion of ore-forming materials were ultimately unfavorable for the deposition of magnetite.",
2254,"Endophytic nitrogen fixation in sugarcane: present knowledge and future applications In Brazil the long-term continuous cultivation of sugarcane with low N fertiliser inputs, without apparent depletion of soil-N reserves, led to the suggestion that N-2-fixing bacteria associated with the plants may be the source of agronomically significant N inputs to this crop. From the 1950s to 1970s, considerable numbers of N-2-fixing bacteria were found to be associated with the crop, but it was not until the late 1980s that evidence from N balance and N-15 dilution experiments showed that some Brazilian varieties of sugarcane were able to obtain significant contributions from this source. The results of these studies renewed the efforts to search for N-2-fixing bacteria, but this time the emphasis was on those diazotrophs that infected the interior of the plants. Within a few years several species of such 'endophytic diazotrophs' were discovered including Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, Herbaspirillum seropedicae, H. rubrisubalbicans and Burkholderia sp. Work has continued on these endophytes within sugarcane plants, but to date little success has been attained in elucidating which endophyte is responsible for the observed BNF and in what site, or sites, within the cane plants the N-2 fixation mainly occurs. Until such important questions are answered further developments or extension of this novel N-2-fixing system to other economically important non-legumes (e.g. cereals) will be seriously hindered. As far as application of present knowledge to maximise BNF with sugarcane is concerned, molybdenum is an essential micronutrient. An abundant water supply favours high BNF inputs, and the best medium term strategy to increase BNF would appear to be based on cultivar selection on irrigated N deficient soils fertilised with Mo.",
2255,"COAL IN SUB-SAHARAN-AFRICAN COUNTRIES UNDERGOING DESERTIFICATION Coal has been reported in 11 of the 16 sub-Saharan countries discussed in this appraisal: Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia. No coal occurrences have been reported in Gambia, Togo, Burkina, Chad, and Djibouti but coal may be present within these countries because neighboring countries do contain coal-bearing rocks. Most of these countries are undergoing desertification or will in the near future. Wood, directly or in the form of charcoal, constitutes two-thirds of the fuel used in Africa. Destruction of forest and shrub lands for fuel is occurring at an increasing rate because of desertification and increasing energy demands. The decline in biological productivity, coupled with concentration of population in areas where water is available and crops may be grown, leads to increasing shortages of wood for fuel. Part of the present and future energy needs of the sub-Saharan region could be met by use of indigenous coal and peat. Nine sedimentary basins, completely or partially within the sub-Saharan region, have the potential of either coal and/or peat deposits of economic value: 1-Senegal Basin, 2-Taoudeni Basin and Gao Trough, 3-Niger Basin, 4-Chad Basin, 5-Chari Basin, 6-Benue Trough (Depression), 7-Sudan Trough, 8-Plateau and Rift Belt, and 9-Somali Basin. Niger and Nigeria are the only countries in sub-Saharan Africa in which coal is presently being mined as a fuel source for powerplants and domestic use. Peat occurs in the deltas, lower river, and interdunal basin areas of Senegal, Mauritania, and Sudan. Peat can be used as an alternate fuel source and is currently being tested as a soil amendment in the agricultural sector. Coal and peat exploration and development studies are urgently required and should be initiated so the coal and peat utilization potential of each country can be determined. The overall objective of these studies is to establish, within the sub-Saharan region, energy independent countries using indigenous coal and peat resources. These resources have the potential to replace wood and wood charcoal as domestic fuel in the urban centers, as well as producing electrical and industrial energy, thus reducing expensive oil imports and decreasing the rate of deforestation.",
2256,"Groundwater quality assessment using a new integrated-weight water quality index (IWQI) and driver analysis in the Jiaokou Irrigation District, China Groundwater is an important water resource in arid and semi-arid regions. The impact of human activities on groundwater is increasing. After 60 years running, the groundwater quality and its formation mechanism are imperative questions needed to be answered in Jiaokou Irrigation District, Guanzhong Basin, China. In this study, the quality of groundwater in Jiaokou Irrigation District was assessed by a new integrated-weight water quality index (IWQI), and the groundwater chemistry is studied through integrated statistical, geostatistical and hydrogeochemical approaches. The patterns for the average anion and cation concentrations were HCO(3)(-) > SO(4)(2-) > Cl(-) > NO(3)(-) > CO(3)(2-) > NO(2)(-), and Na(+) > Mg(2+ >) Ca(2+) > K(+) > NH(4)(+), respectively. Statistics showed that the major water chemistry types were HCO(3)(-)Na, SO(4)Â·Cl-Na, and ClÂ·SO(4)-Na. A new integrated-weight water quality index (IWQI) was proposed based on the entropy-weighted method and CRITIC method and showed excellent performance for explaining and evaluating the groundwater quality. The IWQI results show 65.33% of groundwater, mainly distributed in the central and western parts of this study area, was unsuitable for drinking. Furthermore, SO(4)(2ï¼), HCO(3)(ï¼), Cl(ï¼), NO(3)(ï¼), and Na(+) had more important effects on groundwater quality. The weathering process affecting groundwater quality in the study area is carbonate dissolution, followed by silicate weathering and evaporite dissolution, whereas the major geochemical processes include the dissolution and precipitation of calcite, as well as the dissolution of dolomite and gypsum (anhydrite). Cation exchange also plays an important role in the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater with a long residence time. Anthropogenic activities affecting groundwater quality included long-term irrigation infiltration and excessive use of fertilizers. The findings and the results of the study can improve understanding of the processes driving groundwater chemistry in Jiaokou Irrigation District, and can be used for reference to other similar regions in the world.",
2257,"Naturally occurring potentially toxic elements in groundwater from the volcanic landscape around Mount Meru, Arusha, Tanzania and their potential health hazard The population of the semi-arid areas of the countries in the East African Rift Valley (EARV) is faced with serious problems associated with the availability and the quality of the drinking water. In these areas, the drinking water supply largely relies on groundwater characterised by elevated fluoride concentration (> 1.5Â mg/L), resulting from interactions with the surrounding alkaline volcanic rocks. This geochemical anomaly is often associated with the presence of other naturally occurring potentially toxic elements (PTEs), such as As, Mo, U, V, which are known to cause adverse effects on human health. This study reports on the occurrence of such PTEs in the groundwater on the populated flanks of Mt. Meru, an active volcano situated in the EARV. Our results show that the majority of analysed PTEs (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Sr, Pb, and Zn) are within the acceptable limits for drinking purpose in samples collected from wells, springs and tap systems, suggesting that there is no immediate health risk associated with these PTEs. However, some of the samples were found to exceed the WHO tolerance limit for U (> 30Â Î¼g/L) and Mo (> 70Â Î¼g/L). The sample analysis also revealed that in some of the collected samples, the concentrations of total dissolved solids, Na(+)Â and K(+)Â exceed the permissible limits. The concerning levels of major parameters and PTEs were found to be associated with areas covered with debris avalanche deposits on the northeast flank, and volcanic ash and alluvial deposits on the southwest flanks of the volcano. The study highlights the need to extend the range of elements monitored in the regional groundwater and make a more routine measurement of PTEs to ensure drinking water safety and effective water management measures.",
2258,"Temporal variations of groundwater quality in the Western Jianghan Plain, China The Western Jianghan Plain (WJHP) lies in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It has been impacted by anthropogenic activities during the past decades. The long-term variations of the WJHP's regional aquifer's hydrochemistry and groundwater quality have not been previously assessed. Sixteen physiochemical parameters at 29 monitoring wells within the Western Jianghan Plain were monitored during 1992-2010 and analyzed with multiple approaches. The confined groundwater is predominantly of the HCO(3)-Ca-Mg type with Cl(-), SO(4)(2-), NH(4)-N, and NO(3)-N showing remarkable spatial variations. Correlation analysis was used to identify the origins and contamination sources of groundwater. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test revealed that pH, NO(3)-N, and Cl(-) concentrations at 27, 26 and 15 wells, respectively, exhibited significant increasing trends during 1992-2010. The increase of pH may be attributed to CO(2) degassing caused by extensive groundwater extraction. Regional average NO(3)-N concentrations of groundwater increased coincidently with the increased use of fertilizer, which suggests that nitrate pollution is caused by agricultural activities. Abnormally high values of Cl(-) and SO(4)(2-) at some wells were induced by industrial chemicals. In addition, the similarity of the temporal variations of the regional average of pH, NH(4)-N, and NO(3)-N concentrations in groundwater with those in the Yangtze River at the outlet of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) suggests that the variations of these parameters in the WJHP is partly due to water storage by the TGR. This study presents an analysis of temporal variations of groundwater quality in the WJHP that reveals a relation between the creation of the TGR and downstream groundwater quality. This paper's findings provide clues for measures that could be taken to protect the groundwater quality of the WJHP's aquifer.",
2259,"Heavy Metal Contamination in Groundwater around Industrial Estate vs Residential Areas in Coimbatore, India INTRODUCTION: Water is the vital resource, necessary for all aspects of human and ecosystem survival and health. Depending on the quality, bore water may be used for human consumption, irrigation purposes and livestock watering. The quality of bore water can vary widely depending on the quality of ground water that is its source. Pollutants are being added to the ground water system through human and natural processes. Solid waste from industrial units is being dumped near the factories, which react with percolating rainwater and reaches the ground water. The percolating water picks up a large number of heavy metals and reaches the aquifer system and contaminates the ground water. The usage of the contaminated bore water causes the diseases. Mercury, Arsenic and Cadmium are used or released by many industries. AIM: This study was conducted to investigate the pollution of bore water in the industrial region (Kurichi Industrial Cluster) of Coimbatore, in the state of Tamilnadu, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four samples were taken from residential areas around Kurichi Industrial Cluster and analysed to find the concentrations of Mercury, Arsenic and Cadmium. Four more samples were taken from other residential regions far from the industrial estate and served as control. Samples were analysed using Atomic absorption spectrophotometry method. RESULTS: We found that the ground water of the areas surrounding the industrial cluster does not contain significant amount of those metals. Instead, Heavy metal contamination of ground water were observed in some residential areas of coimbatore. CONCLUSION: The regulatory measures to contain and prevent ground water contamination by industries undertaken by Tamilnadu pollution control board may have lead to absence of heavy metal contamination in Kurichi Industrial cluster, Coimbatore, India.",
2260,"DEA models for non-homogeneous DMUs with different input configurations The data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology is a benchmarking tool where it is generally assumed that decision making units (DMUs) constitute a homogeneous set; specifically, it is assumed that all DMUs have a common (input, output) bundle. In earlier work by the authors the issue of non-homogeneity on the output side was investigated. There we examined a set of steel fabrication plants where not all plants produced the same set of products/outputs. In the current research we investigate non-homogeneity on the input side. Such can occur in manufacturing plants, for example, when the output bundle can be produced using different mixes of machines, robots and laborers. Thus, we can have an input configuration existing in a DMU that is different from the configuration in another DMU. As a practical application of this phenomenon, we examine the measurement of efficiencies of a set of provinces in China. There, all provinces have the same common set of outputs in the form of GDP, supported population, and an undesirable output, nitrogen dioxide. On the input side, however, this commonality is missing. While all provinces have water, capital investment and natural resources, the latter of these (natural resources) takes several different forms, namely coal, natural gas and petroleum. However, not all provinces have the same mix of these resources, nor are there clear exchange rates among these very different, albeit substitutable inputs. This means that that one cannot directly apply the conventional DEA methodology. This then raises the question as to how to fairly evaluate efficiency when the configuration or mix of inputs can differ from one DMU to another. To address this, we view the generation of outputs for a province as a set of processes created by the different configurations of natural resources available. We develop a DEA type of methodology to evaluate these processes. This evaluation provides important insights into not only the overall performance of each province, but as well provides measures of the efficiency of the various configurations of the three natural resources.

2261,"Forward and backward critical sectors for CO(2) emissions in China based on eigenvector approaches China had taken measures to reduce the emissions of CO(2) these years as a staunch supporter of the Paris Agreement. However, it is not such an easy task for the authority to decide which sectors should take responsibility on the process of CO(2) emissions reduction in the context of highly connected supply chains. Based on the sectoral CO(2) emissions and input-output table of China, this study provided both forward and backward perspectives based on eigenvector approaches to identify the critical sectors that are critical for the CO(2) emissions in value chains, including a backward method called power-of-pull method that identifies the pulling effect of demand side and a forward method called power-of-push method that identifies the pushing power of supply side. The results showed that the electricity and hot water production and supply was the most influential pulling sector in the studying period, followed by the metal mining in the backward direction. In the forward direction, the electricity and hot water production and supply was also the top 1 important sector while coal mining ranked the second. The results suggest that electricity and hot water production and supply played a vital role in the CO(2) emission in the system. During the studied period from 2007 to 2015, the power of nonmetal mining to pull CO(2) emissions showed a notable increase. Our proposed approach could be helpful for policy-making because of its user-friendliness comparing with other method as well as providing a new perspective.",
2262,"Evaluation of health hazards in children from regions with nitrate pollution Nitrate pollution of drinking water can be potentially hazardous with health risks for considerable groups of people. Methemoglobin in blood and concentration of nitrates and nitrites in morning saliva, urine, and plasma as sensitive indicators of nitrate accumulation in the body were analysed in 12-14-year-old children living in villages with nitrate pollution of the drinking water. The children were distributed in two experimental groups of 18-21 children each. Nitrates and nitrites were analysed in biological fluids by a modified cadmium-reduction method. Nitrate accumulation in the body was significantly higher in the nitrate pollution exposed children than in the unexposed children which correlated with greater health hazards.",
2263,"Ecological risk assessment of soils under different wastewater irrigation farming system in Punjab, Pakistan Pakistan is an agricultural and developing country. The use of wastewater to irrigate agricultural farms is increasing day by day due to water shortage in the country. This study assessed the Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI) of soils of agricultural farms (six sites) being irrigated with industrial effluents, urban sewage, canal and tube-well water in suburb of Multan city, Pakistan. Surface soil samples (n = 30) from the six sites were analyzed for cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Samples of wastewater/water (n = 30) used for irrigation from respective sites were analyzed for same metals for statistical analysis. Mean contents (mg/kg) of Cd (5.65), Cr (153.1) and Pb (63.95) in soil under industrial effluents exceeded the threshold limits. The ecological risk factor 5650 > 320 for Cd was the highest and contributed 91-98.6% in raising the ecological risk. Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb were the prominent contaminants in soil across all sites. Soil under industrial effluents showed very high ecological risk (PERI 5730>600) and soils under urban wastewater exhibited moderate risk (PERI 153.5-294) and soils under tube well and canal water indicated low risk (PERI 138-149.7<150). Statistical analysis indicated that soil contamination is sourced from wastewater and water applied for irrigation is. Very high and moderate ecological risk of soils are source of food chain contamination. Proper treatment of wastewater before its use in agricultural farming system may save the health of ecosystem.",

2265,"Intensity Reassessment of the 2017 Pohang Earthquake M-w = 5.4 (South Korea) Using ESI-07 Scale The earthquake environmental effects (EEEs) around the epicentral area of the Pohang earthquake (M-w-5.4) that occurred on 15 November 2017 have been collected and classified using the Environmental Seismic Intensity Scale (ESI-07 scale) proposed by the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) focus group. The shallow-focus 15 November Pohang earthquake did not produce any surface rupture, but caused extensive secondary environmental effects and damage to life-line structures. This earthquake was one of the most damaging earthquakes during the instrumental seismic era of the Korean Peninsula. The EEEs included extensive liquefaction, ground cracks, ground settlement, localized rockfall, and variation of the water table. The main objective of this paper was to carry forward a comparative assessment of the Pohang earthquake's intensity based on traditional macroseismic scales and the ESI-07 scale. With that objective, this study will also make a substantial contribution to any future revision of the ESI-07 scale, which mostly comprises case studies from Europe and South America. The comparison of the ESI-07 scale with traditional intensity scales similar to the intensity scale used by the Korean Meteorological Administration for the epicentral areas showed 1-2-degree differences in intensity. Moreover, the ESI scale provided a clearer picture of the intensity around the epicentral area, which is mostly agricultural land with a lack of urban units or buildings. This study urges the integration of the traditional and ESI-07 scale for such small magnitude earthquakes in the Korean Peninsula as well as around the world in future. This will predict seismic intensity more precisely and hence provide a more-effective seismic hazard estimation, particularly in areas of low seismic activity. The present study will also provide a useful and reliable tool for the seismic hazard assessment of similar earthquakes around the study area and land-use planning at a local scale considering the secondary effects.",
2266,"A Co-extraction Technology of Coal and CBM based on the Law of Gas Advanced Relieving Pressure of In-seam Coalface In view of the issue on lower gas drainage rate of in-seam, the co-extraction technology of coal and CBM based on the law of gas advanced relieving pressure of in-seam coalface was proposed. In this paper, the law of gas advanced discharging pressure of in-seam coalface was revealed by establishing the Model coupled gas flow and deformation of coal seam in co-extraction of coal and CBM, which was numerically solved based on the technology parameters of working face KY at YANGQUAN mineral area in China. The research results show that the decreased coal stress is corresponding with increased borehole gas drainage quantity in the coal ahead of coalface except for the coal near coalface. And the zone gradually increased gas emission located at 0-30 m ahead of coalface is the best location to extract pressure-relief gas of in-seam for gas drainage boreholes.",
2267,"Non-carcinogenic health risk assessment of nitrate in bottled drinking waters sold in Iranian markets: A Monte Carlo simulation The main objective of the current research was to evaluate nitrate content in different brands of bottled drinking waters sold in Iranian markets using the available data in the literature and to assess the health risk associated with the consumption of drinking water containing this contaminant. The concentrations of nitrate in different brands of bottled waters in Iranian markets from 16 previous studies during 2010-2018 were derived and used for human health risk assessment. PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar and also Iranian database (Irandoc) were searched to find all published studies regarding the levels of nitrate in bottled drinking waters in Iran. The health risk assessment was estimated using chronic daily intake and hazard quotient based on the methodology suggested by the USEPA. The levels of nitrate in published studies varied considerably, ranging from 0.1 mg/L to 35.2 mg/L which were less than the regulatory limit of 45 mg/L for drinking water set by the USEPA. The ranges of CDI values for bottled waters were as follows: 5.13x10(-4) mg/(kg d) - 8.38x10(-1) mg/(kg d) [mean 3.93x10(-1) mg/(kg d)], 1.58x10(-5) mg/(kg d) - 2.58x10(-2) mg/(kg d) [mean 1.21x10(-2) mg/(kg d)], 1.09x10(-6) mg/(kg d) - 1.78x10(-3) mg/(kg d) [mean 8.33x10(-4) mg/(kg d)] for men, women, and children, respectively. The results showed that health risk in all the studies was well within the safe zone (HQ < 1) during all the years, which indicates that these bottled waters do not induce non-carcinogenic risk. The order of non-carcinogenic health risks in studied groups was as: men > women > children.",
2268,"Appraisal of drinking water quality of tehsil Jampur, Pakistan The quality of drinking water is vital for humans in order to remain alive, healthy and disease free. Consequently, it is indispensible to make sure that the available drinking water is uncontaminated. This study aimed at finding the quality of drinking water in Jampur, which is one of the tehsils of district Rajanpur in South Punjab, Pakistan. Thirty water samples were collected from different locations of the study area. These samples were gathered from different sources such as hand pump, injector pump, tube well and water supply line. The water quality was examined by comparing its standards with World Health Organization provided guidelines. It was found that majority of the Jampur's population were using contaminated water, which is very harmful and alarming. This contaminated water could cause a potential risk to people's health through many waterborne and skin diseases. The contamination of water could be due to dissolved contaminants and excessive ions such as arsenic, sodium, calcium or nitrate, etc. It is recommended that safety measures should be taken before exploiting this water for drinking. For the purification of contaminated water, filtration plants must be installed in the region.",
2269,"Spatial and temporal evaluations of disinfection by-products in drinking water distribution systems in Beijing, China Disinfection by-products were determined in 15 water treatment plants in Beijing City. The effects of different water sources (surface water source, mixture water source and ground water source), seasonal variation and spatial variation were examined. Trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were the major disinfection by-products found in all treated water samples, which accounted for 42.6% and 38.1% of all disinfection by-products respectively. Other disinfection by-products including haloacetonitriles, chloral hydrate, haloketones and chloropicrin were usually detected in treated water samples but at lower concentrations. The levels of disinfection by-products in drinking water varied with different water sources and followed the order: surface water source > mixture water source > ground water source. High spatial and seasonal variation of disinfection by-products in the drinking water of Beijing was shown as a result.",
2270,"Effect of Safe Water on Arsenicosis: A Follow-up Study BACKGROUND: Arsenic pollution in groundwater, used for drinking purposes, has been envisaged as a problem of global concern. Treatment options for the management symptoms of chronic arsenicosis are limited. Mitigation option available for dealing with the health problem of ground water arsenic contamination rests mainly on supply of arsenic safe water in arsenic-endemic region of Indo-Bangladesh subcontinent. Limited information is available regarding the long-term effect of chronic arsenic toxicity after stoppage of consumption of arsenic-containing water. OBJECTIVE: The current study was, therefore, done to assess, objectively, the effect of drinking arsenic safe water (<50 Î¼g/L) on disease manifestation of arsenicosis. RESULTS: Manifestations of various skin lesions and systemic diseases associated with chronic arsenic exposure were ascertained initially by carrying on baseline study on 208 participants in Nadia (Cohort-I, with skin lesion and Cohort-II, without skin lesion) using a scoring system, as developed by us, and compared objectively at the end of each year for 3 year follow-up period. All the participants who had arsenic contaminated drinking water source in their houses were supplied with arsenic removal filters for getting arsenic-free water during the follow-up period. In participants belonging to Cohort-I, the skin score was found to improve significantly at the end of each year, and it was found to be reduced significantly from 2.17 Â± 1.09 to 1.23 Â± 1.17; P < 0.001 at the end of 3 year's intervention study indicating beneficial effect of safe water on skin lesions. The systemic disease symptom score was also found to improve, but less significantly, at the end of 3 years in both the cohorts. Most important observation during the follow-up study was persistence of severe symptoms of chronic lung disease and severe skin lesion including Bowen's disease in spite of taking arsenic-safe water. Further, death could not be prevented to occur because of lung cancer and severe lung disease. CONCLUSION: It is, therefore, an urgent need to make arrangement for availability of safe water source among the arsenic-affected people in the district. Many of the people in the affected villages are not aware of contamination of their home tube wells with arsenic. Awareness generation and motivation of the people for testing their drinking water sources for arsenic and environmental interventions like rain water harvesting, ground water recharge, and restricting excessive use of ground water for domestic and agricultural purposes are also important to prevent further exposure of arsenic to these people.",
2271,"INTEGRATED FATIGUE ANALYSIS OF THE GAP STRUCTURAL SYSTEM MURPHY Sabah Oil Co. Ltd. has developed the Kikeh Field located offshore Malaysia in the South China Sea in a water depth of 1325m. This field development is based on a Floating Production Storage and Offloading unit (FPSO) and a Spar Dry Tree Unit (DTU). Fluids are transported in fluid transfer lines (FTL) using SBM's newly developed and patented Gravity Actuated Pipe (GAP) system. The GAP is an interesting combination of mooring (tether chains), dynamic steel riser (carrier pipe and flowlines) and steel structures (towheads). Design codes and standards usually address the design of these components separately. One of the challenges of the GAP project is to have a consistent design philosophy for all the components so that the GAP can be treated as an integrated system with homogeneous quality and safety levels. GAP component fatigue analysis is a good example of integrated system design. In the GAP, fatigue loading is applied by the floaters, through the tether chains, to the towheads into the carrier pipe. The fatigue analysis of individual GAP components cannot be performed in isolation - it must be the result of an integrated GAP fatigue analysis. A global model of the GAP is built with towheads modelled as rigid bodies and tether chains and carrier pipe modelled as dynamic lines. This model is used to obtain time series of loads on all components of the GAP. The fatigue of each component is calculated using the same methodology based on stress Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) for a selected number of combinations of FPSO headings, wave directions, FPSO drafts and fluid densities. This methodology is classical for chains and steel pipes. It is less classical to apply such a detailed methodology for large structures like towheads. The towhead structures are key components that provide connection between tether chains and carrier pipe, flexible jumpers and steel flow lines, carrier pipe and decoupling overhead buoyancy tank. As such, the fatigue analysis of the towhead is as critical as for the tether chains and the carrier pipe. Finite element models of the towheads have been subjected to unit loads from all components attached to them and from the dynamic fluid pressures generated by unit towhead accelerations. Using the loads extracted from hydrodynamics calculations on the global GAP model. and the matrix of stress for unit loads, the time domain approach is kept throughout the complete structural assessment of the towheads. This is in order to maintain a high degree of accuracy in the stress prediction. Given the criticality of the carrier Pipe, a very detailed Engineering Criticality Assessment (FCA) is performed to define flaw acceptance criteria to be used during the Non Destructive Examination (NDE) campaign.",
2272,"Biosorption of uranium (VI) and thorium (IV) onto Ulva gigantea (Kutzing) bliding: discussion of adsorption isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamic Ulva gigantea (Kutzing) bliding (UGB) obtained from sea inlet of Izmir-Turkey has been studied as a biosorbent for removal of radioactive metals from water. In this study, unmodified UGB and modified UGB with glutaraldehyde (GUGB) characterized by FTIR spectroscopy were used as biosorbents for removal of U(VI) and Th(IV) ions from aqueous solution. Adsorption experiments performed under batch process with initial pH, contact time, adsorbent mass and temperature as variables. In order to determine the adsorption characteristics, Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Raduschkevich adsorption isotherms were applied to the adsorption data. Adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption isotherms correlated well with the Freundlich model. The sorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The thermodynamic parameters such as variations of Delta HA degrees, Delta GA degrees and Delta SA degrees were estimated as a function of temperature. The thermodynamics of the adsorption of U(VI) and Th(IV) onto UGB and GUGB indicates that the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the process. The results showed that UGB and GUGB were potential for application in removal of U(VI) and Th(IV) from aqueous solution.",
2273,"Mineralization and sustainable development in the West African Craton: from field observations to modelling This Special Publication combines results obtained by interdisciplinary groups from numerous academic institutions working on Paleoproterozoic formations to decipher the origins of the main mineralization resources in the West African Craton (WAC) and their impacts on African economic development. Structural, geophysical, sedimentological, stratigraphical, geochemical, petrophysical and mineralogical analyses have been used to highlight the complexities involved in mineralization emplacement and its origin and evolution within the WAC. Fourteen articles, mainly of basic research carried out in the WAC and surrounding areas, contribute to new knowledge in mineral research with updated references. They show that the geodynamic evolution of the WAC is complex from one area to another: it involves subduction, collision and obduction during several deformation phases ranging from Birimian (2.3-2.0 Ga) to Pan-African (650-450 Ma) events. Mineralization is mainly controlled by tectonics within shear zones, orogenic belts, basins and faulting systems occurring in the various corridors. Mineralized fluid circulation is stressed and injected into appropriate formations and precipitate several types of well-documented ore deposits: porphyry, metal-bearing, volcanogenic massive sulfide, sedimentary exhalative and lateritic. Various modelling techniques, when integrated, help in understanding the mechanisms of mineralization emplacement, some of which are still a matter of debate. Traditional and industrial exploitation of ore deposits, mainly gold, may inadvertently cause pollution to water tables and rivers, thus affecting the environment including watersheds. The challenge for further studies is mitigation for sustainable development that can be appropriately used to minimize such damage. The aim of this volume is thus to bring new insights to research activities on ore deposits within the WAC.",
2274,"Animal Welfare in Extensive Production Systems Is Still an Area of Concern Traditionally, research on farm animal welfare has mainly been focused on welfare problems thought to be common in intensive systems, whereas the welfare of animals kept in extensive systems has attracted much less attention. This may be due to the generally held belief that extensive systems are advantageous in terms of animal welfare. Although it is undeniable that extensive systems have many benefits in terms of animal welfare, they are by no means free of welfare problems. This review highlights the animal welfare problems that are most likely to be found in extensive systems following the four animal welfare domains of ""nutrition,"" ""environment,"" ""health,"" and ""behavior."" Extensive environments are highly variable and heterogeneous in terms of climate conditions, food quality, and access to high-quality water, and this can raise serious welfare concerns related to chronic hunger and thirst, and thermal stress. These problems will vary depending on the location and time of year. Some diseases are more likely in extensive systems than in intensive ones and this can be compounded by supervision of animals being more difficult in extensive systems. Several painful husbandry procedures as well as neonatal mortality and predation are other potential welfare issues for animals raised in extensive systems. Finally, infrequent handling and / or potentially aversive handling can impair human-animal relationship and have a negative effect on the welfare of extensive livestock. Detection and monitoring of welfare problems in extensive systems are essential for implementing practical solutions adapted to local challenges. Selecting animals that are adapted to local conditions reduces some of the welfare problems encountered in extensive systems. Practice-led innovations should be undertaken in extensive systems and should support knowledge-exchange strategies with producers.",
2275,"The Configuration of Forest Cover in Ribeirao Preto: A Diagnosis of Brazil's Forest Code Implementation The fragmentation of forests is a consequence of human activities that intensively change the natural landscapes. In Brazil, there is a long-standing legal framework for native vegetation protection, called Forest Code. The last update is from 2012. The revisions incorporated in this restructured code (Law No. 12,651/12) encompassed new rules, rights and obligations for adequate land use management of productive systems and for environmental conservation and protection. An example of a protective measure was the creation of a Legal Reserve inside the rural properties and Areas of Permanent Protection around the watercourses. This study explored the effects of implementing the new code on the spatial and temporal evolution of forest cover fragmentation since the legal changes were set up. In that context, the area, perimeter and shape (circularity index) of forest fragments, as well as the buffer strips along watercourses, were assessed from 2010 to 2016 within the municipality of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The assessment resorted to remote sensing techniques and visual inspection of orbital images. It was clear from the results that forest patches became more abundant but smaller, more dispersed and elongated, and that this route to fragmentation was hinged on a chaotic expansion of urban and agricultural areas. Important edge effects were anticipated from these results. The area numbers revealed that Ribeirao Preto was 7.95% covered with forest fragments in 2010, while this percentage rose to 8.03% in 2013 and reached 8.35% in 2016. Most of this increase occurred within a 30-meter wide buffer along the watercourses. This was a positive outcome. However, the numbers also revealed that forested areas smaller than 51 hectares increased from 71% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The conclusions were that implementation of Law No. 12,651/12 is leading to an increase of forestland, but not yet promoting sustainability, namely through improved connectivity among fragments for reduction of edge effects and provision ecosystem services.",
2276,"Removal of Phenolic Compounds from Synthetic Solution and Oil Mill Waste Water by Adsorption onto Nanoparticles Synthesized from Phosphate Rock In this work, we studied the elimination of phenol compounds from phenolic solutions and Oil Mill Waste Water (OMWW) by adsorption method. The adsorbents used are natural phosphate rock coming from Khouribga phosphate mine (Morocco) and an Apatite synthesized from this phosphate by a dissolution-precipitation reactions. Results obtained showed that the structure of natural phosphate and synthesized apatite are respectively Ca-9.55(PO4)(4.96)F-1.96(CO3)(1.283) and (Ca-10(OH)(2)(PO4)(6)). Synthesized apatite has a higher specific surface than natural phosphate (193.62m(2)/g). The adsorption study showed that the synthesized apatite can be used as an adsorbent to remove phenol from water with very fast reaction kinetics (about 10 min) and an adsorption capacity equal to 15mg/g. The optimal adsorption capacity was found in low values of temperature and in neutral pH. Adsorption kinetics of phenol solution on the two adsorbents can be described by an equation corresponding to a pseudo second order. Freundlich model fitted well with the adsorption isotherms more than the Langmuir model. Characterization of olive mill wastewater shows that, phenol index equal to 0.39 g/l and chemical oxygen demand COD equal to 158 g/l. The treatment of OMWW by adsorption method on the two adsorbents shows that the use of natural phosphate as adsorbent reduced phenol index by 23% and (COD) by 35% while using synthesized apatite reduced phenol index by 30% and COD by 38%.",
2277,"The study of the relationship between the soil chemistry and all water system in parts of Kuhi mineral belt area, Nagpur district, Maharashtra The paper deals with the relationship between soil chemistry, surface & sub-surface water chemistry and geology of the Kuhi mineral belt, Nagpur district, Maharashtra. Water samples were collected from shallow aquifers and surface water and were analyzed for major ions and trace elements. The study was also made to assess the suitability of these waters for irrigation use. Topsoil samples were collected and analyzed for trace elements. Chemical analysis shows that majority of the groundwater of the area is calcium bicarbonate type. Statistical analysis determines high positive correlation values for cobalt-and nickel in water as well as soil. The spatial distribution of Co, Ni, in soil and Co, Ni and Pb in groundwater are nearly similar. Water samples, 7 out of 46 were found un-suitable for irrigation. use based on RSC, salinity hazard and Boron concentration parameters. The surface-water samples of Nag River show decreasing concentration of major ions and trace elements along the flow. Based on field and laboratory observations it was found that the Nag River water is suitable for irrigation even though it contains high detergents with objectionable colour, taste and odour.",
2278,"The Late Quaternary evolution of water masses in the eastern Indian Ocean between Australia and Indonesia, based on benthic foraminifera faunal and carbon isotopes analyses Benthic foraminifera and carbon isotopes from closely spaced samples taken from three deep-sea cores were analysed to reconstruct the palaeoceanographic evolution of the eastern Indian Ocean for the last 30 kyrs, with an extension back to 60 kyrs based on one core. Benthic foraminifera were studied by means of Q-mode Factor Analysis. The benthic foraminifera accumulation rate (BFAR) and the accumulation rates (AR) of Bulimina aculeata, Epistominella exigua and Uvigerina proboscidea were calculated for determining episodes of increased organic matter supply to the sea floor. The 6180 and 613 C records of Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi were measured from all 3 cores to gather information about past intermediate- and deep-water circulation and changes in sea-surface palaeoproductivity. The co-variance of the organic matter supply and dissolved-oxygen levels affected the distribution of benthic foraminifera. Below a depth of 1800 in, reduced deep-water circulation was recognised by a low delta C-13 Of C. wuellerstorfi and increased carbon-flux rate by a high BFAR and B. aculeata, E. exigua and U. proboscidea AR, as well as by a B. aculeata faunal dominance. A more oligotrophic environment was characterised by a low BFAR and B. aculeata, E. exigua and U. proboscidea AR. Active deep-water circulation was postulated with high delta C-13 values for C. wuellerstorfi and by a faunal dominance by C wuellerstorfi. At intermediate depths (similar to 1000 in) and south of 20 degrees S, the presence of strong bottom currents and the lateral advection of small amounts of organic matter, favoured the suspension feeder C. wuellerstorfi. Under extremely high dissolved-oxygen levels, determined by the increased influence of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (seen through high delta C-13 of C. wuellerstorfi) and a reduced supply of organic matter, Nummoloculina irregularis and Globocassidulina subglobosa dominated the benthic foraminifera assemblage. The reduction of oxygen levels, a more stratified water column and the Leeuwin Current flow, along its present pattern, favoured the species U. proboscidea and Bolivina robusta. Based on these observations, the following palaeoceanographic evolution of the eastern Indian Ocean is proposed: center dot For 60-35 kyr BP, conditions of higher productivity (compared to the Present) at the sea surface were suggested for the Banda Sea. center dot For 35-15 kyr BP, high productivity still characterised the Banda Sea. Strong and oxygenated bottom currents were present offshore Western Australia. For the Last Glacial Maximum, a reduction of deep-water circulation characterised the eastern Indian Ocean, while more active circulation was recorded at intermediate depths. Productivity also increased offshore the north coast of Western Australia. center dot For 15-5 kyr BP, a reduction in productivity levels over the Banda Sea is related to increased atmospheric precipitation, which led to the formation of a low-salinity water cap at the sea surface. Off the north coast of Western Australia, productivity levels remained similar to those recorded for the LGM, probably due to the nutrients injected into the sea by rivers. Off the northwest coast of Western Australia, a deepened nutricline prevented any increase of organic matter supply to the sea floor. center dot Foy 5 kyr BP-Present, in the Banda Sea, productivity levels are similar to the Present. Off the Western Australian coast, an increased influence of the oxygen-depleted Indonesian Intermediate Water and the Leeuwin Current engendered a more stratified water column,characterised by lower dissolved-oxygen levels.

2279,"Electro-Hydrodynamic Design of an Intelligent Balloon Water Gate Controlled by an Efficient Maximum-Power-Seeking Controller for a Solar Generation System The intelligent balloon water gate (IBWG) invention is a hydraulic gate model made of reinforced plastic that controls the water level (WL) downstream or upstream of a barrage. The IBWG automatically inflates and deflates by compressed air to close and open the water passage, respectively. The whole design consists of a balloon, a waterway, sensors, an air compressor, a control panel, an electrical circuit and a photovoltaic generation (PVG) system. The Tyass barrage in Iraq was considered as a case study. The Tyass barrage was built with concrete and four sliding steel water gates and redesigned using the IBWG. The originality of the current research resides in the combination of the IBWG mechanism with an efficient maximum power point (MPP) seeking controller for a photovoltaic generation system, which is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy in the world. To the best of our knowledge, in this field, this scenario has not yet been discussed in detail. Upper and lower water sensors are used to control the IBWG. The upper sensor sends a signal to the control panel when the downstream water level reaches its maximum value to open the air inlet valve and close the outlet valve, inflating 14 IBWGs with a volume of 3.5 m(3) under 122 psi of pressure and closing the water passage. When the WL decreases below the minimum level, the lower sensor initiates the opposite procedure. The air compressor automatically fills the air tank to 181 psi and is supplied by a 24 VDC AGM rechargeable battery with a capacity of 40-60 Ah, which is charged by four solar panels connected in parallel and exposed to an average of 8.8 hrs/day of sunshine. The proposed MPP-seeking controller was implemented by a backstepping design coupled with the grey wolf mechanism. The solar irradiance data were observed 39 years ago. The proposed controller is capable of following the MPP with minimum oscillations under an external irradiance variation. The IBWG system is verified at night or during the early morning when the sun is not active. Nevertheless, it is possible to store compressed air in an auxiliary tank to avoid emergencies such as partial shading conditions.",
2280,"Electrical resistivity tomography determines the spatial distribution of clay layer thickness and aquifer vulnerability, Kandal Province, Cambodia Despite being rich in water resources, many areas of South East Asia face difficulties in securing clean water supply. This is particularly problematic in regions with a rapidly growing population. In this study, the spatial variability of the thickness of a clay layer, controlling surface - groundwater interactions that affect aquifer vulnerability, was investigated using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Data were acquired along two transects, showing significant differences in the imaged resistivities. Borehole samples were analyzed regarding particle density and composition, and linked to their resistivity. The obtained relationships were used to translate the field electrical resistivities into lithologies. Those revealed considerable variations in the thickness of the clay layer, ranging from 0 m up to 25 m. Geochemical data, highlighting zones of increased ingress of surface water into the groundwater, confirmed areas of discontinuities in the clay layer, which act as preferential flow paths. The results may guide urban planning of the Phnom Penh city expansion, in order to supply the growing population with safe water. The presented approach of using geophysics to estimate groundwater availability, accessibility, and vulnerability is not only applicable to Kandal Province, Cambodia, but also to many other areas of fast urbanization in South East Asia and beyond.",
2281,"Structural and hydrogeological features of a Lias carbonate aquifer in the Triffa Plain, NE Morocco The rising demand for water and the contamination of shallow water table aquifers has led authorities in NE Morocco to look for deeper groundwater resources in the Triffa Plain, namely in Lower Jurassic (Lias) dolomitic limestones. The liassic aquifer is of strategic importance for the development of the region, however, its hydrodynamic behaviour is poorly understood due to lack of hydrogeological data and block structure. This article presents a first effort towards understanding the structure and hydraulic behaviour of the aquifer. Exploration borehole data and results from geophysical campaigns were integrated into a GIS environment to build a preliminary model of the aquifer structure. The aquifer behaves as an unconfined aquifer in the northern part of the Beni Snassen Mountains (the recharge area), but as it dips to the north, it becomes confined by marls and shales of the Middle/Upper Jurassic. Even though piezometric level data are scarce, a tentative piezometric map was produced. Three blocks separated by NW-SE trending faults in a horst and graben structure, with distinct flow behaviours were identified: Berkane, Fezouane and Sidi Rahmoun blocks. Those blocks also show differences in hydraulic conductivity distribution. As a result of the reaction with the dolomitic limestones, the groundwater is of calcium-magnesium bicarbonate type. Groundwater temperature as measured in springs ranges from 29 degrees C to 37 degrees C in springs and constitutes a potential low enthalpy geothermal resource. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2282,"Humoral immune response to repeated lumpy skin disease virus vaccination and performance of serological tests BACKGROUND: In the presented study we investigated the development of the humoral immune response against LSDV during the process of re-vaccination of cattle over a time span of 5 months. In addition, the performance of different serological techniques for antibody detection against LSDV was compared. For sample collection, an area without previous LSD outbreak reports in Serbia was selected. Seventy-nine cattle from twenty farms vaccinated in 2016 and re-vaccinated in 2017 were included in the study. Two farms from the same area with good calving management were selected for investigation of passive LSDV antibody transfer from vaccinated mothers to new-borne calves. RESULTS: All investigated cattle were healthy on the day of vaccination and during the whole study. Swelling at the injection site or other side effects of vaccination did not occur after re-vaccination in the study. Detection of LSD-specific antibodies was performed with the standard serological methods VNT and IFAT as well as a commercially available Capripox double antigen multi-species-ELISA. Capripoxvirus-specific antibodies were detected 46 to 47â€‰weeks after vaccination in 2016, with VNT in 35.06% and with IFAT and ELISA in 33.77%. A secondary response was observed in all three tests 1 month after re-vaccination with a significant increase in seropositive animals compared to the results before re-vaccination. With all applied serological methods, the number of animals testing positive was significantly higher at 1 and 5 months post re-vaccination than before re-vaccination. No significant statistical difference (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05) was observed between the results of all three tests used. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA was estimated to be Se(ELISA) 91% and Sp(ELISA) 87% calculated by the results of VNT and Se(ELISA) 88% and Sp(ELISA) 76% calculated by the results of IFAT. Passive antibody transfer from vaccinated mothers to new-born calves was investigated at 14â€‰days after birth. Discrepancies for the detection of LSDV specific antibodies between cows and newborn calves at the age of 14â€‰days were observed in VNT and IFAT, but not in ELISA. CONCLUSION: Of all tests used the commercially available ELISA shows to be the most useful for high throughput analysis compared to VNT or IFAT.",
2283,"A New Method for Research on Unsteady Pressure Dynamics and Productivity of Ultralow-Permeability Reservoirs In the numerous low-permeability reservoirs, knowing the real productivity of the reservoir became one of the most important steps in its exploitation. However, the value of permeability interpreted by a conventional well-test method is far lower than logging, which further leads to an inaccurate skin factor. This skin factor cannot match the real production situation and will mislead engineer to do an inappropriate development strategy of the oilfield. In order to solve this problem, key parameters affecting the skin factor need to be found. Based on the real core experiment and digital core experiment results, stress sensitivity and threshold pressure gradient are verified to be the most influential factors in the production of low-permeability reservoirs. On that basis, instead of a constant skin factor, a well-test interpretation mathematical model is established by defining and using a time-varying skin factor. The time-varying skin factor changes with the change of stress sensitivity and threshold pressure gradient. In this model, the Laplace transform is used to solve the Laplace space solution, and the Stehfest numerical inversion is used to calculate the real space solution. Then, the double logarithmic chart of dimensionless borehole wall pressure and pressure derivative changing with dimensionless time is drawn. The influences of parameters in expressions including stress sensitivity, threshold pressure, and variable skin factor on pressure and pressure derivative and productivity are analyzed, respectively. At last, the method is applied to the well-test interpretation of low-permeability oil fields in the eastern South China Sea. The interpretation results turn out to be reasonable and can truly reflect the situation of low-permeability reservoirs, which can give guidance to the rational development of low-permeability reservoirs.",
2284,"Modelling the effects of water-point closure and fencing removal: A GIS approach Artificial water-points in the form of troughs or ground tanks are used to augment natural water supplies within rangelands in many parts of the world. Access to such water-points leads to the development of a distinct ecological sub-system, the piosphere, where trampling and grazing impact modify the vegetation. This study aims to consolidate existing information in a GIS based model to investigate grazing patterns within the landscape. The model focuses on the closure of water-points and removal of fences on Nanya Station, New South Wales, Australia. We found that the manipulation of water-points and fences in one management intervention may change grazing activity in a way different to that which would be experienced if each had been modified separately. Such effects are further modified by the spatial distribution of the water-points and the underlying vegetation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2285,"Antibiotics Sensitivity and Heavy Metals Resistance in PHB-Producing Bacilli Isolated from Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia There has been considerable interest in development and industrial production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biopolymers from bacteria due to its potential applications in agriculture, health and medicine. However, it is recommended to evaluate PHB-producing bacteria regarding sensitivity to antibiotics, resistance to heavy metals and possible toxicity before large scale production of the biopolymer. In this study, 120 bacterial strains isolated from different soil and sewage water samples in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia, and screened for PHB production. Sixteen strains showed positive results with Sudan Black B and Nile Red A stains. 16S DNA gene analysis revealed high homologies to members of Bacillus cereus group, B. megaterium, B. flexus, B. endophyticus, and B. aryabhattai. For antibiotic profiling; B. cereus DS3-16 and B. thuringiensis DST1-33 showed highest resistance, especially to ampicillin, erythromycin and amoxicillin, while the least were B. megaterium DG8, DP7 and B. pseudomycoides DWST2-1. Bacillus sp. DSG5 and DPS6 followed by DSWT2-1, DS3-17 and DS3-12 showed highest resistance to Cr+6 (10 mg/mL), as well as Hg (62.5 mu g/mL) and Ag (5 mg/mL), respectively while most strains were highly susceptible to other metals. Four isolates including B. cereus strain DS3-16 showed beta-hemolysis activity, while Bacillus axarquiensis DSG5 showed a-hemolytic activity, indicating their possible toxicity.

2286,"Association between physical and geochemical characteristics of thermal springs and algal diversity in Limpopo Province, South Africa Algal species commonly occur in thermophilic environments and appear to have very wide geographical distributions. Presence of algal species is strongly influenced by temperature, pH and mineral content of thermal waters. No research has previously been documented on the algal diversity in South African thermal springs. This paper describes the algal distribution in 6 thermal springs in Limpopo Province, South Africa, and attempts to link this to the physical and geochemical properties of the springs. Water samples were collected from Mphephu, Siloam, Tshipise, Sagole, Eiland and Soutini thermal springs and algae identified. Temperature, pH and TDS were measured on site and water samples analysed for macro- and trace-elements. Cyanophyta was the algal group most often present, followed by Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta and Dinophyta. Some of the algae were present in waters with pH ranging from 7.1-9.7 and temperatures ranging from 40-67 degrees C. Others (the cyanobacteria and green algae: Nodularia, Schizothrix, Anacystis, Coelastrum, Chlorella and Spirogyra) only occurred in high temperature (60+degrees C) and pH>9 waters, while a number of diatoms (Synedra, Aulacoseira, Nitzschia, Cyclotella, Gyrosigma, Craticula) occurred exclusively at temperatures <45 degrees C and pH values <8. Algae were also present in waters with fluoride values exceeding that which is considered safe for human consumption as well as in waters relatively rich in uranium, rubidium, vanadium and manganese. It was clear that the occurrence of algae coincided with specific geological formations. These algae could act as indicator species of geology and heavy metals.",
2287,"Direct and Indirect Reduction of Cr(VI) by Fermentative Fe(III)-Reducing Cellulomonas sp. Strain Cellu-2a Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is recognized to be carcinogenic and toxic and registered as a contaminant in many drinking water regulations. It occurs naturally and is also produced by industrial processes. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) has been a central topic for chromium remediation since Cr(III) is less toxic and less mobile. In this study, fermentative Fe(III)-reducing bacterial strains (Cellu-2a, Cellu-5a, and Cellu-5b) were isolated from a groundwater sample and were phylogenetically related to species of Cellulomonas by 16S rRNA gene analysis. One selected strain, Cellu-2a showed its capacity of reduction of both soluble iron (ferric citrate) and solid iron (hydrous ferric oxide, HFO), as well as aqueous Cr(VI). The strain Cellu-2a was able to reduce 15 Î¼M Cr(VI) directly with glucose or sucrose as a sole carbon source under the anaerobic condition and indirectly with one of the substrates and HFO in the same incubations. The heterogeneous reduction of Cr(VI) by the surface-associated reduced iron from HFO by Cellu-2a likely assisted the Cr(VI) reduction. Fermentative features such as large-scale cell growth may impose advantages on the application of bacterial Cr(VI) reduction over anaerobic respiratory reduction.",
2288,"A fluid inclusion study of the Panguna porphyry copper deposit, Bougainville, Papua New Guinea Copper mineralization at Panguna took place at a pressure of 200 to 300 bars and at temperatures between 350Â° and 700Â°C or higher. Cu, Fe sulfides, quartz, anhydrite, and hematite were deposited by dense, boiling, salt-rich liquids of magmatic origin. The composition of the salt-rich liquids (those which nucleated both KC1 and NaCl in fluid inclusions) in terms of the system NaCl-KCl-H20 varied between 76 percent salts (60% NaCl, 16% KC1) and 46 percent salts (30% NaCl, 16% KC1) by weight. Other liquids, apparently more dilute, nucleated only NaCl. The salt-rich liquids also contained Fe, Ca, and S04 and minor quantities of Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn. A Cu concentration of 1,900 ppm has been estimated in one liquid. The atomic K/Na ratios of salt- rich liquids from three principal phases of vein mineralization and from quartz pheno- crysts conformed to a single trend, increasing from 0.17 to 0.46 as the NaCl content decreased. The first phase of mineralization (phase A) took place when the southern part of the Kaverong Quartz Diorite was at temperatures higher than 700Â°C. The temperature and salinity distributions for this phase were asymmetric; cooling and dilution of the salt-rich liquids took place south and southwest of the orebody but have not been detected to the north or east. The zone of cooling and dilution corresponds closely with the 0.3 percent Cu ore-grade contour and the edge of major quartz deposition and is paralleled by a pyritic halo. The system cooled below 400Â°C before undergoing renewed mineralization at temperatures over 400Â° C in the two approximately concurrent phases B and C. These phases were accompanied by the intrusion of porphyritic stocks. Phase B formed a well-defined cell bounded by a pyritic halo and centered on the Leucocratic Quartz Diorite. Phase C was expressed as veining of the Biotite Grano- diorite, the Biuro Granodiorite, and the area between them. Ground water, generally of less than 10 percent salinity, inundated the orebody between phase A and phases B and C, and again after phases B and C, at temperatures below 400Â°C. Within the orebody there was no salinity continuum between ground water and the salt-rich liquids. Ground water deposited quartz-pyrite and probably pyrite-clay and sphalerite-pyrite veins at temperatures near 300Â°C and caused local phyllic alteration. The distribution of fluids in space and time is consistent with the porphyry copper model in which a magmatic- hydrothermal system is surrounded by a cooler meteoric-hydrothermal system, the latter collapsing inward as the former wanes. Given a hydrostatic pressure regime in the meteoric-hydrothermal system, the depth of formation was 2 to 3 km.",
2289,"Thermal fluids and scalings in the geothermal power plant of Kizildere, Turkey The Kizildere geothermal power plant is located in western Anatolia, Turkey. Large amounts of scalings have been observed in the production wells, separators and waste water systems. The upwelling fluid looses 33% of its CO2 and 2% of water. The initial degassing starts at 600 m below the well head. Gases enrich towards the head of the well and cause pressure anomalies. The loss of CO2 leads to increasing pH, oversaturation with respect to CaCO3 and precipitation of scalings. The scalings are mainly composed of calcite, in the upper part of the well aragonite is dominating. Calculations with SOLMINEQ.88 confirmed a non monotonous development of the precipitation rates within the production well.",
2290,"A survey of the microbial community in the rhizosphere of two dominant shrubs of the Negev Desert highlands, Zygophyllum dumosum (Zygophyllaceae) and Atriplex halimus (Amaranthaceae), using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plant roots comprise more than 50% of the plant's biomass. Part of that biomass includes the root microbiome, the assemblage of bacteria and fungi living in the 1-3 mm region adjacent to the external surface of the root, the rhizosphere. We hypothesized that the microorganisms living in the rhizosphere and in bulk soils of the harsh environment of the Negev Desert of Israel had potential for use as plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) to improve plant productivity in nutrient-poor, arid soils that are likely to become more common as the climate changes. â€¢ METHODS: We used cultivation-dependent methods including trap experiments with legumes to find nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, specialized culture media to determine iron chelation via siderophores and phosphate-solubilizing and cellulase activities; cultivation-independent methods, namely 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing; and also community-level physiological profiling to discover soil microbes associated with the Negev desert perennials Zygophyllum dumosum and Atriplex halimus during the years 2009-2010. â€¢ KEY RESULTS: We identified a number of PGPB, both epiphytes and endophytes, which fix nitrogen, chelate iron, solubilize phosphate, and secrete cellulase, as well as many other bacteria and some fungi, thereby providing a profile of the microbiomes that support the growth of two desert perennials. â€¢ CONCLUSION: We generated a snapshot of the microbial communities in the Negev Desert, giving us an insight in its natural state. This desert, like many arid environments, is vulnerable to exploitation for other purposes, including solar energy production and dry land farming.",
2291,"PROSPECTING FOR SILVER STRIKING PLATINUM: Our First LEED Project Prospecting demands positive future orientation, hope, sometimes not even knowing what it is you might discover. We were hopeful prospectors on our first LEED project, not exactly sure what we might strike. We sought silver sustainability for the University of New Mexico (UNM) College of Education Building (COE); what we discovered was even more precious and rare, platinum. Getting there entailed chipping away at each sustainable LEED credit until we hit pay dirt, the first publicly-funded and second LEED Platinum building in New Mexico. Gregory T. Hicks & Associates P. C. Architects was contracted by UNM to design a LEED Silver Certified building for its new COE Administration and Classroom Building, Phase 1. All new, state-funded buildings in New Mexico must achieve a minimum LEED Silver certification as mandated by Governor's Executive Order. Two of our staff, Jim MacGillivray and Jay Davis, are LEED APs, and our Principal, Gregory T. Hicks, has taken several USGBC courses, but this being our first LEED project, we participated in additional study in LEED certification and sustainable design. We also hired an experienced sustainable design specialist to serve as our LEED AP, our lead prospector, Susan Barnett. Not knowing how easy or difficult it might be to achieve LEED Silver, the prudent approach was to strive for as many points as possible, so that if we lost a few points along the way we would still fulfill the obligations of our contract. UNM COE and other UNM staff championed this approach. Our initial strategy targeted LEED credits with minimal cost, those almost free, logical modifications that improve sustainability. Next, we focused on achieving four ""Innovation in Design"" credits, searching for ideas that would involve minor costs or creative design endeavor. UNM COE committed to a photovoltaic system for educational and research purposes as well as to purchase a renewable energy certificate. Our initial venture targeted up to 48 possible points, comfortably within Gold territory. We submitted our project to USGBC for design review as the project went out to bid. The design review denied a few points in some areas, but serendipitously awarded a few extra points in other areas. UNM COE supported the prospects of achieving Gold so we provided additional information to successfully appeal denied credits, which brought us back up to a potential of 48 points, assuming targeted points were awarded during the construction review. At this point we knew we would certainly achieve Silver, possibly Gold. Midway through construction, the COE Dean, Richard Howell, and COE Chief of Staff, Diane Gwinn, asked us if there might be a way to earn just 4 or more points to reach the 52 required for LEED Platinum. Steve Chavez, UNM Project Manager, strongly championed this effort. This seemed difficult, if not impossible at this juncture in the project, but we met with COE, UNM engineers, design engineers, LEED AP, and the contractor to brainstorm possibilities. We came up with eight possibilities, but not all were affordable, practical, or supported, so we whittled the eight down to five, but just before the construction review we lost one of the five, so we tried for four. When the USGBC completed their construction review, we learned we had scored 52 points awarded LEED Platinum certification. Partnership of UNM COE, architect, engineers, LEED APs, and contractor created this success through a relentless ""can-do"" attitude throughout the project, plus some luck. Boring down deeply, we sought Silver and struck Platinum. This narrative is organized according to the USGBC LEED credit rating system and highlights the sustainable accomplishments of the project along with lessons learned.",
2292,"The probable maximum flood at the Ukai and Lakhwar dam sites in India The design of impounding structures where failure would lead to catastrophic loss of life requires an estimate of the probable maximum flood. In India there are over 3000 dams and more are being built and planned to meet the needs for water supply, power, and irrigation. Recently, revised estimates of probable maximum precipitation have been published. These new estimates are used in conjunction with instantaneous unit hydrographs (IUH) to assess the safety of two dam sites: the Lakhwar dam on the Yamuna River, and the Ukai dam on the Tapi River. The results show that at the first site the outflow exceeded the design value of the spillway by a factor of 2.27, while at the second site the ratio was 2.25. The IUH results are supported by flood frequency analyses using a modified Gumbel scale and also results derived from the Rational method. These outcomes illustrate that in India more attention to dam safety is a dire need for the future.",
2293,"Kaolin deposits from the northern sector of the Cunene Anorthosite complex (southern Angola) The Mevaiela kaolin deposits are located in the northern part of the anorthositic-gabbro massif within the Cunene complex (Southern Angola) and were formed by the alteration of basic anorthosites and gabbros. The Mevaiela area is part of an elevated region which is located between two extensive NNW-SSE fracture systems. Several kaolinite samples were collected from a quarry (main excavation) and from drill-holes as well as from surficial occurrences in the Cunene complex. Chemical analyses, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy and isotope analyses were performed in order to model the kaolinite occurrences. The alteration of the anorthosite to kaolin approaching the main excavation is characterized by significant decrease in alkaline-earth and transition metals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Co, Ni and Mn) between the average anorthosite and the kaolin. The crystallinity indices suggest that the kaolin contains kaolinite with a reasonably well ordered structure and near the transition between T (triclinic) and pM (pseudo monoclinic). Mineral exploration tools have been evaluated during this study to assist in future kaolin exploration in the Cunene anorthosite complex. Isotopic analysis of O and D indicates that Ca-feldspar alteration is essentially due to meteoric fluids, over a different range of temperatures. Furthermore, the presence of quartz-feldspar veinlets in the kaolinite bodies could be the result of hydrothermal activity linked to post-anorthosite granite intrusions of the so-called 'red granite'. Kaolinite from Cunene plots on or close to the kaolinite line into the 'warm temperature in tropical region' area (surficial samples). Samples from drill-holes plot on the left and show the largest displacement from the KS line; these samples also have a relatively reduced 8D range of values (-65 to -98 parts per thousand). However, if supergene processes take place in the presence of waters of meteoric origin at temperatures similar to typical Surface temperatures, the clays thus formed should plot either in the vicinity of the KS line or be displaced towards lower delta O-18 and higher delta D, depending on both the temperature and relative proportion of clay to water.",
2294,"Microbial activity records in Marinoan Snowball Earth postglacial transition layers connecting diamictite with cap carbonate (Otavi Group, NW-Namibia) This study concerns the microbial mat formation in postglacial layers of the Marinoan Snowball Earth glaciation. A high resolution investigation was carried out on the transition layers of Ghaub to Maieberg Formation (start of Keilberg Member) of the Otavi Group in NW-Namibia (Neoproterozoic). Macroscopic characterization, optical rock microscopy, XRD mineralogy, Raman spectroscopy investigations were done and geochemical (major and trace element content) as well as carbonate carbon isotopic data were collected. Three types of microbial contributions were determined: (1) primary, synsedimentary Fe-rich biomats; (2) secondary biomats from biodegradation of Fe-bearing minerals (pyrite, chlorite); and (3) pseudo-secondary structures coating on clasts. These microbial mats of iron-oxidizing bacteria consumed iron from different sources, such as hydrothermal solutions or ironbearing minerals. On the basis of the morphology of Fe-biomats, and the mineralogical and geochemical signatures, we suggest that the Marinoan postglacial transition layers (Ghaub-Maieberg boundary) formed under neutral, suboxic conditions in brackish water at the studied locality.",
2295,"Worrying exposure to trace elements in the population of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The particularly high rate of urbanization in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo) is associated with environmental degradation. Outdoor and indoor air pollution, as well as water pollution and waste accumulation, are issues of major concern. However, little documented information exists on the nature and extent of this pollution. A biomonitoring study was conducted to document exposure to trace elements in a representative sample of the population in Kinshasa. METHODS: Fifteen trace elements were measured by ICP-MS, CV-AAS, or HG-AFS in spot urine samples from 220 individuals (50.5% women) aged 6-70 years living in the urban area and from 50 additional subjects from the rural area of Kinshasa. Data were compiled as geometric means and selected percentiles, expressed without (Î¼g/L) or with creatinine adjustment (Î¼g/g cr). RESULTS: Overall, living in urban Kinshasa was associated with elevated levels of several parameters in urine as compared to the population living in the rural area (Asi, Ba, Cd, Cr, and V) as well as compared to an urban population of the southeast of Congo (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, Se, V, and Zn). Elevated levels were also found by comparison with the reference values in databases involving American, Canadian, French, or German populations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first biomonitoring database in the population of Kinshasa, revealing elevated levels for most urinary TE as compared to other databases. Toxicologically relevant elements such as Al, As, Cd, Pb, and Hg reach levels of public health concern.",
2296,"Coupled effects of land use pattern and hydrological regime on composition and diversity of riverine eukaryotic community in a coastal watershed of Southeast China The coupled effects of land use pattern and hydrological regime on composition and diversity of riverine eukaryotic community are needed for understanding riverine ecosystem health and algal blooming mechanism. In-situ monitoring and 18S rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate spatiotemporal variations of eukaryotic community in three types of watershed with different dominant land use type (i.e. urban, forest, and natural) during three seasons (i.e. dry, transition, and wet seasons) in a coastal watershed of Southeast China. Results showed that agricultural and urban watersheds had significantly higher diversity in dry and transition seasons, and higher richness in transition and wet seasons than those in forest watershed. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis further verified great spatiotemporal variations of eukaryotic community. Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Animalia, and Eukaryota, dominated the sequences reads for all sampling sites in three seasons. Agricultural watershed had the highest relative abundant of Animalia, whereas Eukaryota was the most abundant in urban watershed and forest watershed had the highest relative abundance of Stramenopiles and Alveolata. The RDA ordination showed that Builtup and streamflow were two most important factors for moderate taxa and abundant taxa, respectively. Variation partitioning revealed that land use pattern and hydrological regime together explained 54.4%, 61% and 67.2% variances of the composition of eukaryotic community. Among three sampling seasons, the relative contribution of land use pattern was higher than that of hydrological regime. The results of this investigation demonstrated how land use pattern and hydrological regime affected the composition and diversity of riverine eukaryotic community. The findings can provide a useful insight into the riverine eukaryotic communities and their underlying ecological mechanisms in coastal China watersheds.",
2297,"The impacts of geochemistry and agricultural activities on groundwater quality in the soutpansberg fractured aquifers A study has been made to investigate the impacts of geochemistry and agricultural activities on groundwater quality in the Soutpansberg Mountains and its neighbourhoods, South Africa. The agrochemicals, livestock wastes, decayed plants and geochemistry potentially pollute groundwater. The physical and chemical parameters were measured and analyzed in the field and laboratory, respectively. The pH and electrical conductivity were within the recommended guidelines. Turbidity exceeded the recommended guidelines in most of the boreholes. Calcium and magnesium exceeded the acceptable levels. Nitrate, chloride and sulphate were within acceptable levels except for boreholes in northern and the south-western side of the mountain. The high levels of the metals and non-metals are mainly from fertilizers, organic waste and waste sludge used to improve production and from livestock. The impacts of agricultural activities on groundwater quality varied from one farm to another. The geologic formations of the study area do not have significant impacts on groundwater quality.

2298,"An integrated GIS-based interval-probabilistic programming model for land-use planning management under uncertainty-a case study at Suzhou, China A large number of mathematical models have been developed for supporting optimization of land-use allocation; however, few of them simultaneously consider land suitability (e.g., physical features and spatial information) and various uncertainties existing in many factors (e.g., land availabilities, land demands, land-use patterns, and ecological requirements). This paper incorporates geographic information system (GIS) technology into interval-probabilistic programming (IPP) for land-use planning management (IPP-LUPM). GIS is utilized to assemble data for the aggregated land-use alternatives, and IPP is developed for tackling uncertainties presented as discrete intervals and probability distribution. Based on GIS, the suitability maps of different land users are provided by the outcomes of land suitability assessment and spatial analysis. The maximum area of every type of land use obtained from the suitability maps, as well as various objectives/constraints (i.e., land supply, land demand of socioeconomic development, future development strategies, and environmental capacity), is used as input data for the optimization of land-use areas with IPP-LUPM model. The proposed model not only considers the outcomes of land suitability evaluation (i.e., topography, ground conditions, hydrology, and spatial location) but also involves economic factors, food security, and eco-environmental constraints, which can effectively reflect various interrelations among different aspects in a land-use planning management system. The case study results at Suzhou, China, demonstrate that the model can help to examine the reliability of satisfying (or risk of violating) system constraints under uncertainty. Moreover, it may identify the quantitative relationship between land suitability and system benefits. Willingness to arrange the land areas based on the condition of highly suitable land will not only reduce the potential conflicts on the environmental system but also lead to a lower economic benefit. However, a strong desire to develop lower suitable land areas will bring not only a higher economic benefit but also higher risks of violating environmental and ecological constraints. The land manager should make decisions through trade-offs between economic objectives and environmental/ecological objectives.",
2299,"Risk factors for anaemia in pregnancy in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Implication for health education and health promotion Background: Anaemia in pregnancy is a major public health problem in developing countries. It is associated with an increased risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A high rate of anaemia in pregnancy in the rural population of KwaZulu-Natal (30% according to national and 57% according to the World Health Organization [WHO] definition of anaemia in pregnancy) is observed. The risk factors for anaemia, particularly during pregnancy, are multiple and complex and their relative contributions are known to vary by geographic areas and by seasons. In order to design an intervention for treatment and prevention of anaemia in pregnancy, studies to assess the aetiological factors are necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the strength of association between intestinal helminthiasis, urinary schistosomiasis and HIV infection on anaemia in pregnancy. Methods: A retrospective case-control study design was used in a rural district hospital of South Africa. A total of 300 pregnant women, 100 of them with anaemia (haemoglobin less than 10 gm/dL according to the national definition of anaemia in pregnancy) referred as cases and 200 controls were studied from Empangeni Hospital. Both cases and controls were matched for age, parity and gestational age. Data were collected from the antenatal clinic and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programme registers for cases and controls at their booking visit during the months of May, June and July of 2004. Univariate and multiple logistic regression were performed to analyse the data. Results: Of the cases, 48% and 1% among the controls had intestinal helminthiasis, resulting in the odds ratio of 42 (p = 0, 000 and 95% CI 9, 96 - 176.59). The risk of anaemia was related to urinary schistosomiasis, as 27% of the cases compared to 1% of controls was found with anaemia. The odds ratio was 12 (p = 0, 000 and 95% CI 3.58 - 41.02). These parasitic infestations are known to cause chronic haemorrhage and iron deficiency resulting in the development of anaemia in pregnancy. Transmissions of intestinal parasitic infestation occur through the faecal-oral route. Personal hygiene and other environmental factors are therefore an important factor for the transmission of the disease. To reduce the transmission of faecaloral diseases (e.g. intestinal helminthiasis and urinary schistosomiasis) key interventions recommended are: 1) safe disposal of human excreta, 2) hand-washing practices with soap after defecation, and 3) maintenance of drinking water free from faecal contamination. Similarly, HIV infection increased the chance of developing anaemia in pregnancy twofold as HIV infection was more common among cases (56%) than among controls (37%), resulting in an odds ratio of 2.11 (p = 0, 003 and 95% CI 1.123 - 3.21). The prevention of HIV infection and transmission can be achieved through the improvement of knowledge of these conditions. These can be achieved through health education and health promotion. Conclusion: These findings confirm and conform to other studies on the association between anaemia in pregnancy and parasitic and HIV infections. Antenatal care should promote de-worming and education on personal hygiene and HIV (risk factors, mode of transmission, etc.). The provision of safe water supply and toilet facilities for the rural communities should be considered urgently to prevent and promote better health for all, including pregnant women.",
2300,"Sustainable Design in Metro Stations In addressing the Global Energy Crisis, engineers have the social responsibility to find and implement practical solutions. This paper discusses the sustainable heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) design concepts that can be applied in metro systems. The use of Platform Screen Door (PSD) along the underground station platform to isolate the station from the tunnel has a positive impact on the overall energy consumption of the metro systems in tropical regions (e.g. Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.) and subtropical regions (eg. Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, etc.). During cooler months, the concept of free cooling by introducing more outdoor air in seasoned countries can further reduce energy consumption as well as improving indoor air quality. To contribute on sustainable development, engineers should participate in the overall planning of the metro stations with other stakeholders. Effective use of space is a kg strategy in mitigating the challenge of land scarcity in developed urban cities. This planning may include (1) utilizing the space created incidentally due to metro construction by converting it to commercial areas instead of backfilling it, (2) integrate development above metro stations or (3) connecting the metro stations to neat, developments to mitigate impact to the aboveground traffic. For sustainable design, Central Chiller Plant can be considered for adjacent stations and their connecting developments. Apart from saving initial cost and running cog this approach also saves the overall land space. To further release space above ground for other usage, open top vent shafts can be designed to reduce the size of the aboveground structure. There are other sustainable designs in metro systems that are related to HVAC design. Taking the lighting system for example, the use of 'light without Fitting"" (LwF) concept with Light-emitting Diode (LED) fighting is an ongoing trend to bring a new aesthetic experience to the public. It not only reduces the lighting energy consumption, but also reduces the cooling load requirement. Examples from various projects in Singapore and Hong Kong will be referenced in this paper. Other sustainable measures e.g. Variable Speed Drive (VSD) for pumps and cooling towers, outdoor air control regenerative energy, etc. which have been used in metre systems are also covered in this paper.",
2301,"New era of dark matter particle detection The astronomical evidence of the existence of dark matter is overwhelming. However, the physical nature of dark matter is still unknown. It is widely believed that dark matter is some kind of new particles beyond the standard model of particle physics. Alternative candidates include the massive compact halo objects such as primordial black holes. Among all these candidates, the class of so-called weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is the most natural and well theoretically motivated one. The WIMP scenario can naturally explain the abundance of dark matter in the universe via a canonical thermal production mechanism. It also gives a practical way of detecting those particles via various kinds of particle physics experiments. The direct detection method measures the momentum exchange when a dark matter particle scatters off a nucleus. The sensitivities of direct detection increase remarkably during the past 30 years since it was first proposed in the 1980s. China has operated two direct detection experiments, the CDEX and PandaX experiments, in the Jinping underground laboratory. Through the efforts of all the direct detection experiments, including CDEX and PandaX, the current upper limit about the spin-independent scattering cross section between the dark matter particle and the nucleon reaches the level of 10(-47) cm(2) which is only about two orders of magnitude higher than the neutrino-induced background. Although no convincing signal has been detected yet, such null results can constrain severely many kinds of theoretical models of dark matter. Several experiments are upgrading now, with the goal of a fiducial detector mass of several tons, which are expected to further improve the direct detection sensitivities. The indirect detection method is to search for the annihilation or decay products of dark matter in cosmic rays and gamma-rays, which is complimentary to the direct detection. The main indirect detection experiments in operation include the alpha magnetic spectrometer and the calorimeter electron telescope on the International Space Station, the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope, and China's dark matter particle explorer. Several anomalies have been reported by the indirect detection experiments, such as the positron excess, the excess of the total electron plus positron spectrum, the gamma-ray excess in the Galactic center region. Interpretations of these excesses are still in debate. Nevertheless, these anomalies offer us targets for further investigation with increased statistics and improved understanding of the astrophysical backgrounds. Both the direct detection and indirect detection experiments will have significantly upgrading in the coming years. Particularly, China's PandaX experiment is currently building a 4-ton scale detector which is expected to start to operate in 2021. The long-term plan of the CDEX experiment is also a ton-scale detector for multi-purpose studies including the dark matter searches. For the indirect detection, the HERD payload onboard the Chinese Space Station is in the prototype phase, and the next generation very large area gamma-ray space telescope is under design. On the ground we are building the large high-altitude air shower observatory for high-sensitivity sky survey in the very high energy gamma-ray band. All these efforts will make China play a significant or even leading role in the campaign of dark matter detection. We are looking forward to the breakthroughs in the exploration of the nature of dark matter.",
2302,"Maternal blood arsenic levels and associations with birth weight-for-gestational age BACKGROUND: Among highly exposed populations, arsenic exposure in utero may be associated with decreased birth weight, however less is known about potential effects of arsenic exposure in urban communities without contaminated sources such as drinking water. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the association of blood arsenic levels with birth weight-for-gestational age categories within a prospective birth cohort study. DESIGN/METHODS: We analyzed 730 mother-infant dyads within the Programming Research in Obesity, GRowth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) cohort in Mexico City. Total arsenic was measured in maternal blood samples from the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, at delivery, as well as from infant umbilical cord blood samples. Multivariable, multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for maternal age at enrollment, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, infant sex, socioeconomic position, and prenatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure were used to calculate odds ratios of small-for-gestational age (<10th percentile, SGA) and large-for-gestational age (>90th percentile, LGA) compared to appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) per unit increase of log-transformed arsenic. RESULTS: Median (IQR) blood arsenic levels for maternal second trimester were 0.72 (0.33) Î¼g/L, maternal third trimester 0.75 (0.41) Î¼g/L, maternal at delivery 0.85 (0.70) Î¼g/L, and infant cord 0.78 (0.65) Î¼g/L. Maternal delivery and infant cord blood samples were most strongly correlated (spearman râ€¯=â€¯0.65, pâ€¯<â€¯0.0001). Maternal arsenic levels at delivery were associated with significantly higher odds of both SGA (adj. ORâ€¯=â€¯1.44, 95% CI: 1.08-1.93) and LGA (adj. ORâ€¯=â€¯2.03, 95% CI: 1.12-3.67) compared to AGA. Results were similar for cord blood. There were 130 SGA infants and 22 LGA infants. Earlier in pregnancy, there were no significant associations of arsenic and birth weight-for-gestational age. However, we observed non-significantly higher odds of LGA among women with higher arsenic levels in the 3rd trimester (adj. ORâ€¯=â€¯1.46, 95% CI: 0.67-3.12). CONCLUSION: We found that in a Mexico City birth cohort, higher maternal blood arsenic levels at delivery were associated with higher odds of both SGA and LGA. However, sources and species of arsenic were not known and the number of LGA infants was small, limiting the interpretation of this finding and highlighting the importance of future large studies to incorporate arsenic speciation. If our findings were confirmed in studies that addressed these limitations, determining modifiable factors that could be mitigated, such as sources of arsenic exposure, may be important for optimizing fetal growth to improve long-term health of children.",
2303,"Effect of Dimples on Solar Concrete Plate Collectors and its Comparison with Other Domestic Water Heating Systems Though solar water heater is an environment-friendly and a well-established effective method of heating water, yet it is not used on a large scale in a country like India where abundant solar energy is available for most of the year. A large proportion of population prefers the use of electric geysers or stoves over solar water heaters as they have cheaper initial costs. Thus with an objective of low-cost solar collector water heater, an investigation is conducted on concrete as collector plate. In order to improve the efficiency of concrete plate collector, a serpentine tube is used instead of parallel tubes, with the addition of metal fibers in concrete mixture to improve its thermal conductivity and dimples are created on the serpentine tube to enhance heat flow from tube to water flowing through it. In order to calculate the exact effect of dimples on concrete plate collector, dimpled tube collector is compared with smooth tube collector. It is observed that dimples lead to an increase in outlet water temperature and improved efficiency for all water flow rates. Also in this paper, comparison of concrete plate collector with existing systems of domestic water heating for the bathing purpose is presented.",
2304,"Current levels and composition profiles of emerging halogenated flame retardants and dehalogenated products in sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants in China Occurrence of new toxic chemicals in sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is of concern for the environment and human health. Alternative halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) are a group of potentially harmful organic contaminants in the environment. In this study, a nationwide survey was carried out to identify the occurrence of HFRs and their potential dehalogenated products in sewage sludge from 62 WWTPs in China. Of all 20 target chemicals analyzed, decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and 1, 2-bis (2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-ethane (BTBPE) were detected in all sludge samples, and the concentrations were in the range of 0.82-215, 0.09-65.8, and 0.10-2.26 ng g(-1) d.w., respectively. Dechlorane Plus (DP) was found in 60 of 62 samples, and the concentration ranged from nd-298 ng g(-1) with a mean of 18.9 ng g(-1) d.w. The anti-DP fractional abundance fanti (0.79) in the samples was much higher than the commercial DP composition (fanti=0.59), indicating a stereoselective degradation. Comparison with global sludge concentrations of HFRs indicate that China is at the medium pollution level in the world. Principal components analysis revealed that strong correlations existed between ln-transformed concentrations (natural logarithm) of the dominant BFRs and total organic carbon (TOC) as well as industrial wastewater proportion, influent volume and serving population. Significant linear relationships (R=0.360-0.893, p<0.01) were found among emerging brominated flame retardants (BFRs), suggesting their common commercial applications and release sources to the environment. Two kinds of dehalogenated products, pentabromocyclododecane (PBCD) and undecachloropentacyclooctadecadiene (Cl11-DP), derived from HBCD and DP, were also identified in sewage sludge for the first time.",
2305,"Well placement optimization for large-scale geothermal energy exploitation considering nature hydro-thermal processes in the Gonghe Basin, China Doublet well system composed by extraction and injection wells is widely used for heat production from deep geothermal reservoirs. The large-scale implementation of doublet well systems lead to hydro-thermal interaction with the natural hydro-thermal flow system; this affects heat production efficiency and sustainable management of geothermal energy and groundwater resources. However, the interaction between artificial operations and nature hydro-thermal status was seldom considered in the well placement optimization. In this study, the natural status of hydro-thermal flow was determined by fitting numerical modeling output to the groundwater level and temperature observations, in a realistic site of the Gonghe Basin, China. The well separation and relative position were then optimized against background water flow direction. It was found that a well separation of 1200 m with the injection well located upstream (south) to the extraction well can maximize the volume of injected water entering extraction well, without influence on the outflow temperature. Based on this finding, we further compared the effects of ""extensive well placement"" where the wells were located sparsely in entire geothermal field, and ""intensive well placement"" where the wells were located centrally in a local region. The calculation showed that the performance of intensive well placement was superior to extensive well placement with higher outflow temperature and lower interruption in groundwater levels. Further optimization of intensive well placement resulted in the outflow temperature higher than 92 degrees C under the total outflow rate of 30,000 m(3)/d for 30 years, and the groundwater level changes can be controlled below 6.0 m. The multiple-step well placement optimization approach and novel intensive heat production mode regarding nature status of hydro-thermal flow in geothermal reservoirs, provides important reference to the other geothermal field for large-scale geothermal exploitation.",
2306,"Approaches for identifying PM(2.5) source types and source areas at a remote background site of South China in spring The receptor model is an effectively and widely used tool for analyzing the source of PM(2.5), and its development and improvement have always been focused and challenged. In this study, approaches of source analysis is applied and compared. The PM(2.5) samples were collected in spring of 2015 at a remote background site of Weizhou, South China and were analyzed for water-soluble ions, trace metals, and sugars. The 28 measurement species were introduced into the positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model for inter-comparison of PM(2.5) prediction. Results showed that the NMF model is a more robust tool to identify source types and source apportionment in the case of a small sample size (nâ€¯=â€¯31). In NMF, four source variants were obtained as dust (15.6%), biomass combustion (11.8%), secondary formation (17.6%), and coal combustion (54.9%), corresponding to four main source areas. These were Southeast Asia, South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, as well as Pearl River Delta, respectively. The areas were distinguished based on hybrid receptor models, potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT), by introducing the daily loadings of each source factor from NMF method. These model results were highly consistent with categorized chemical characteristics of PM(2.5), suggesting that NMF linking with hybrid receptor models provides valuable implications for exploring source types and source areas of PM(2.5). Meanwhile, biomass combustion and coal combustion comparably contributed to the high PM(2.5) concentrations indicating control strategy in South China in spring.",
2307,"Stochastic capture zone analysis of an arsenic-contaminated well using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimator (GLUE) methodology [1] In 1992, Mexican researchers discovered concentrations of arsenic in excess of World Heath Organization (WHO) standards in several municipal wells in the Zimapan Valley of Mexico. This study describes a method to delineate a capture zone for one of the most highly contaminated wells to aid in future well siting. A stochastic approach was used to model the capture zone because of the high level of uncertainty in several input parameters. Two stochastic techniques were performed and compared: ""standard'' Monte Carlo analysis and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimator (GLUE) methodology. The GLUE procedure differs from standard Monte Carlo analysis in that it incorporates a goodness of fit (termed a likelihood measure) in evaluating the model. This allows for more information (in this case, head data) to be used in the uncertainty analysis, resulting in smaller prediction uncertainty. Two likelihood measures are tested in this study to determine which are in better agreement with the observed heads. While the standard Monte Carlo approach does not aid in parameter estimation, the GLUE methodology indicates best fit models when hydraulic conductivity is approximately 10(-6.5) m/s, with vertically isotropic conditions and large quantities of interbasin flow entering the basin. Probabilistic isochrones (capture zone boundaries) are then presented, and as predicted, the GLUE-derived capture zones are significantly smaller in area than those from the standard Monte Carlo approach.",
2308,"Perfluorinated compounds in surface waters and WWTPs in Shenyang, China: mass flows and source analysis Concentrations of 10 perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) were investigated in the Hun River (HR), four canals, ten lakes, and influents and effluents from four main municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Shenyang, China. Mass flows of four main PFCs were calculated to elucidate the contribution from different sections of the HR. Overall, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) were the major PFCs in the HR, with ranges of 2.68-9.13Â ng/L, and 2.12-11.3Â ng/L, respectively, while perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was detected at lower levels, ranging from 0.40 to 3.32Â ng/L. The PFC concentrations in the HR increased after the river passes through two cities (Shenyang and Fushun), indicating cities are an important contributor for PFCs. Mass flow analysis in the HR revealed that PFC mass flows from Fushun are 1.65-5.50Â kg/year for C6-C8 perfluorinated acids (PFCAs) and 1.29Â kg/year for PFOS, while Shenyang contributed 2.83-5.18Â kg C6-C8 PFCAs/year, and 3.65Â kg PFOS/year. The concentrations of PFCs in four urban canals were higher than those in the HR, with the maximum total PFCs of 240Â ng/L. PFOA and PFOS showed different trends along these canals, suggesting different sources for the two PFCs. Total PFCs in ten lakes from Shenyang were at low levels, with the greatest concentration (56.2Â ng/L) detected in a heavily industrialized area. The PFC levels in WWTP effluents were higher than those in surface waters with concentrations ranging from 18.4 to 41.1Â ng/L for PFOA, and 1.69-3.85Â ng/L for PFOS. Similar PFC profiles between effluents from WWTPs and urban surface waters were found. These results indicate that WWTPs are an important PFC source in surface water. Finally, we found that the composition profiles of PFCs in surface waters were similar to those in tap water, but not consistent with those in adult blood from Shenyang. The calculation on total daily intake of PFOS by adults from Shenyang showed that the contribution of drinking water to human exposure was minor.",
2309,"Physicochemical Parameters and Alarming Coliform Count of the Potable Water of Eastern Himalayan State Sikkim: An Indication of Severe Fecal Contamination and Immediate Health Risk Continuous decline in potable water sources has raised serious concerns over human health. Developing countries are the most affected in this regard due to a lack of proper hygiene maintenance. Sikkim, an Eastern Himalayan state with mountains as the predominant topological features, harbors several perennial natural springs. Spring water is the primary source of potable water for the population in four districts of the state viz. East, West, North and South. Recent outbreaks of water-borne diseases and the relative lack of scientific studies on its potential correlation with the water quality of the area have educed this study. Physicochemical parameters of springs, community reservoirs, and household water were analyzed by ICP-MS and multi probe meter. Using the membrane filtration method, the microbial quality of the water samples during different seasons was assessed, primarily evaluating the presence of fecal indicators viz. Escherichia coli, total coliform and Enterococcus. The seasonal risk category of the water sources was also determined. Most of the physicochemical parameters of the spring water were within the permissible limits of WHO standards. However, water from four districts was recorded with traces of toxic heavy metals like mercury (0.001-0.007 mg/l), lead (0.001-0.007 mg/l), and selenium (0.526-0.644 mg/l), which are above the permissible limits of WHO. All the spring water samples were categorized as Mg-HCO3- type and can be predicted as shallow fresh ground water based on the piper analysis. Microbial confirmatory testing indicated severe fecal contamination of water sources with high counts of total coliform (TC), Escherichia coli (EC) and Enterococcus (EN). The highest level of TC was recorded from West Sikkim (37.26 cfu/100 ml) and the lowest in North Sikkim (22.13 cfu/100 ml). The highest level of contamination of E coil and Enterococcus was found in East Sikkim (EC = 8.7 cfu/100 ml; EN = 2.08 cfu/100 ml) followed by South Sikkim (EC = 8.4 cfu/100 ml; EN = 2.05 cfu/100 ml). There was a significant positive correlation between the contamination levels of the spring water and the community reservoir tank. As far as the seasonal variation is concerned, the rainy season showed the most contamination with coliform correlating with a high incidence of different water-borne diseases (East = 86%; West = 100%; South = 100%; North = 80%).",
2310,"Iron, manganese, cadmium, chromium, zinc and arsenic groundwater contents of Agbor and Owa communities of Nigeria Iron, manganese, zinc, cadmium, and chromium heavy metals and arsenic contents of groundwater in area and surrounding environment, of Ika land in the Delta state, Nigeria was studied. Groundwater without any treatment is the predominant source of drinking water by inhabitants of these communities. However, the quality of this water source is not immediately known, raising questions of its safety. Results of a regional composite of groundwater obtained, shows high iron (27%) and zinc (36%) contents in Boji-Boji Agbor area, manganese (31%) was highest in Boji-Boji Owa. Alihame recorded the lowest value of zinc (8%), while manganese was lowest in Agbor Obi area (12%). Arsenic, cadmium, and chromium were below detection limit in all the sample sites. Correlational matrix analysis revealed no significant relationships between metal types studied. Analyses of chronic daily dose intake (CDI), and hazard index were all very low. A hazard index of 0.01 was obtained. One-way ANOVA show significant statistical difference in the mean concentrations of the heavy metals for the different sample sites, which indicate that different sites contribute differently to the mean concentrations of the groundwater in the study area. Four conclusions are drawn from this study. Indications are that the heavy metals present in the Nigerian aquifer are very much below the maximum concentration levels and guideline values of national and WHO standards. Secondly, there is a heavier load of these metals in the city centre than in the suburbs; with Boji-Boji area Agbor/Owa urban areas accounting for 27 and 20 percent of load respectively. Thirdly, the below detection limit results for some of the metal ions and the very low concentrations of those detected are pointers to the absence of industrial activities and mining. Finally, the groundwater in the study area is considered to be generally safe with respect to the contaminants studied and results posted for the composite samples. Inhabitants are therefore under no illusion of immediate or remote health challenges with regards to the heavy metals analyzed. More individual sampling, however, is recommended.",
2311,"Study of Water Quality in Udaipur Region, India Aim of this study is to check the quality of water including water parameters that is pH, heavy metals in the sample. Udaipur, also known as city of lakes, has many lakes and they are the major source of drinking water of the city. To analyze the quality of water, samples were collected from five different lakes of Udaipur region. Due to industrial discharge of waste water of nearby area they are polluted which cause diseases. By using pH meter and atomic absorption spectroscopy in water, pH and presence of heavy metals present in sample was checked. Before using AAS samples were filtered through filter paper to minimize the contaminants of water like dust and other particles. This study's main aim is to check suitability of lake water.",
2312,"MASS DESTRUCTION OF STRONG ROCKS BY PERIODIC EMISSIONS OF HYDRO CHARGES In underdeveloped areas of Kazakhstan, several thousand small gold and rare-metal deposits are located at a depth inaccessible for open mining, which in their limited reserves are either classified as off-balance or are not included in the register of reserves of the SCR (state Committee of reserves). This article discusses the creation and development of new technologies that are based on the use of fundamentally new technical means will be effective and able to reduce the cost of mining. The hydro impulse method of destruction of rocks of any fortress is offered that will allow reducing sharply volumes of capital and operational works at a considerable decrease in their Prime cost. Therefore, it will be possible to involve in the effective development of numerous off-balance gold and rare-metal deposits of Kazakhstan. For this purpose, a comparative analysis of the economic and technical efficiency of the hydro-pulse destruction of strong and abrasive rocks in the ore industry with respect to the existing drilling and blasting technology is given, the developed design of an environmentally friendly electric-discharge hydro-pulse gun GPE-1200 with a very high power of hydrofoil is described.

2313,"Hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater and surface water for domestic and irrigation purposes in Vea catchment, Northern Ghana The Vea catchment, mainly underlain by crystalline basement rocks, is located in Northern Ghana. Hydrogeochemical studies were carried out in this area with the objective of identifying the geochemical processes influencing water quality and suitability of surface and groundwater for agricultural and domestic uses. Sixty-one groundwater and four surface water samples were collected from boreholes, dams and rivers and analysed for Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-, Fe-tot, PO43-, Mn-tot, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-. In addition, pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total hardness, turbidity, colour, salinity and dissolved oxygen were analysed. Chloro-alkaline indices 1 and 2, and characterization of weathering processes suggest that the chemistry of groundwater is dominated by the interaction between water and rocks. Cation exchange and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling the chemical composition of the groundwater in the area studied. Mineral saturation indices indicate the presence of at least three groups of groundwater in the Vea catchment with respect to residence time. The meteoric genesis index suggests that 86% of the water samples belong to the shallow meteoric water percolation type. The findings further suggest that the groundwater and surface water in the basin studied are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type, regardless of the geology. Compared to the water quality guidelines of WHO, the study results on sodium absorption ratio, sodium percentage, magnesium hazard, permeability index and residual sodium carbonate indicate that groundwater and surface water in the Vea catchment are generally suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes.",
2314,"Supply of water to the population of Azerbaijan in emergency situations and its legal and institutional aspects This article is directed at providing some recommendations for improvement of water supply for the population of Azerbaijan in emergency situations. This is possible through application of advanced water management methods and water use technologies based on the experience of leading countries in the world. In order to support implementation of a national program on improvement of the water sector, an action plan was developed. This plan reflects problems existing in water provision to the population and was approved by the government of the Azerbaijan Republic. Parallel with that, comprehensive environmental legal and non-native acts have been adopted during the period of independence. Although they reflect the important economic and political changes, there are many difficulties with their implementation, connected mainly with absence of adequate water management policy, resources, and technology. Therefore, this article indicates that there is need for support of donor countries and international financial institutions for rehabilitation of water supply and wastewater treatment system of different settlements of the country. Today, there is entire utilization of the water system in Azerbaijan as is the case with other countries of the South Caucasus, created during the Soviet times. Water provision to economy sectors and population is carried out by means of active old and inadequate hydrotechnical constructions. Often many water intake facilities and treatment systems are inoperable during high flooding and water turbidity, and extreme pollution. For example, on the September 8, 1999, turbidity at the mouth of the Kura River, where the water intake facility for provision of Baku city is constructed, had increased tens of times as compared to previous days, reaching 9,817 g/3 M-3. As a result, the water treatment system could not operate in its normal regime causing interruptions in the water supply of Baku and Sumgait cities and degradation of the quality of water. There are also many other such cases, the causes are entrance of highly polluted waters from urban areas, industry, and agricultural lands. The main directions for effective water provision to the population of Azerbaijan in emergency situations in the context of sustainable development should include implementation of national and regional programs on water resources management as given in this article. An important step for improvement of water management in emergency situations is the creation and realization of a strong legal and institutional basis that would provide for attaining the required quality and quantity of drinking water, development of projects on determination, and use of alternative water sources in the case of emergency situations and use of modem technologies and methods of water provision. Some options for improved water supply in the case of emergency are described for different regions of the country.",
2315,"ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS TO GROUNDWATER AND ITS EVALUATION OF HYDROCHEMICAL SUITABILITY FOR DRINKING AND IRRIGATION PURPOSE IN THE GOKPINAR DAM BASIN, DENIZLI - TURKEY This study aims to evaluate the hydrochemical properties of groundwater in the Gokpinar Dam basin and its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes. The dam was built primarily to provide irrigation water for agricultural land downstream. On the other hand, groundwater upstream of the dam is both a vital resource for all the needs of the rural people, as well as providing water for the reservoir and all surrounding springs. The basin is under the pressure of anthropogenic potential pollutants such as agriculture, highway, industry, sewage, domestic wastewater, trout and horse farms. The groundwater samples collected from water wells the basin were analyzed in accordance with standard test procedures for the main quality parameters. The dominant hydrochemical facies of groundwater is the Ca2+ - Mg2+ - HCO3- type. In all samples, alkaline earth metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) and weak acid (CO32-, HCO3-) dominates over the alkalies (Na+, K+) and strong acid (Cl-, SO42-). All of the groundwater samples fall in the rock dominance field. The major reactions contributing to the groundwater chemistry are dissolutions of calcite and dolomite. The trace elements, nitrate and nitrite concentration of all samples fulfill the drinking water standards. Despite potential threats in the basin, the results of the hydrogeochemical assessments have shown that groundwater can be safely used for drinking and irrigation for now. However, it is clear that the pressure on groundwater resources in the basin will increase rapidly due to the increasing water demand and climate change.",
2316,"Value of groundwater used for producing extra grain in North China Plain Irrigation has led to increased crop productivity in the North China Plain (NCP) in the past three decades, but also caused quick depletion of groundwater resources with potentially severe hydrological consequences. Future policy development needs to balance crop production and groundwater use for increased sustainability. This requires an understanding of how crop production can be impacted by reduced irrigation and the value of the groundwater used for producing extra grains across NCP. We used cropping systems modelling to assess how the productivity of the wheat-maize system are influenced by spatial climate variability and changes in irrigation water supply across a north-south rainfall gradient in NCP. Our results show that irrigation has minimised the north-south difference in crop productivity, leading to a production gain as large as 9 t/ha/year grain with a total value of up to 19,000 CNY/ha/year in the north. The high water use efficiency (WUE) of irrigation water in the north was similar to the WUE of natural rainfall in the south, allowing the farmers at dry sites to obtain very similar production value to those at the wet sites. The value of groundwater used for producing the extra grains was estimated to be 1.8-8.6 CNY m(-3) water. The results provide the scientific basis for the design of future policies for water pricing and sustainable agricultural development in NCP.",
2317,"Success Factors of Irrigation Projects Based on A ""Public-Private Partnership"" Model in A Mountainous Area: A Case Study in the Nujiang River Valley, China Irrigation systems are critical for food security and drought adaptation in mountainous areas. However, lack of funding and low efficacy of government-funded irrigation projects hinders irrigation infrastructure development. A public private partnership (PPP) model is recommended for irrigation development, but its application in mountainous areas has not been well-documented and analyzed. Based on a case study of pumping station projects in the Lujiang Flatland in the Nujiang River Valley of Southwestern China, this paper aims to reveal the critical success factors of the PPP model in the development of agricultural irrigation infrastructure in mountainous areas. Results showed that the basic models of PPP projects in the study area can be described as follows: (1) private companies invested in and constructed pumping stations; (2) communities operated the stations; (3) farmers paid for the services; and (4) private companies profited from charging water fees, obtaining policy supports, or utilizing farmlands. The main success factors include: (1) rational project design according to local conditions; (2) multi-centered management mechanisms; (3) balanced cost- and risk-sharing mechanisms; and (4) building mutual trusts among stakeholders. This study offers applicable lessons and useful insights for irrigation water development projects and adaptation to drought in mountainous rural communities.",
2318,"Critical review of soil contamination by polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs); concentrations, sources and congener profiles Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used in a broad array of polymeric materials such as plastics, foams, resins and adhesives to inhibit the spread of fires since the 1970s. The widespread environmental contamination and well documented toxic effects of PBDEs have led to bans and voluntary withdrawals in many jurisdictions. Replacement novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) have, however, exhibited many of the same toxic characteristics as PBDEs and appear to share similar environmental fate. This paper presents a critical review of the scientific literature regarding PBDE and NBFR contamination of surface soils internationally, with the secondary objective of identifying probable pollution sources. An evaluation of NBFR distribution in soil was also conducted to assess the suitability of the newer compounds as replacements for PBDEs, with respect to their land contamination potential. Principle production of PBDEs and NBFRs and their consequent use in secondary polymer manufacture appear to be processes with strong potential to contaminate surrounding soils. Evidence suggests that PBDEs and NBFRs are also released from flame retarded products during disposal via landfill, dumping, incineration and recycling. While the land application of sewage sludge represents another major pathway of soil contamination it is not, considered in this review as it is extensively covered elsewhere. Both PBDEs and NBFRs were commonly detected at background locations including Antarctica and northern polar regions. PBDE congener profiles in soil were broadly representative of the major constituents in Penta-, Octa- and Deca-BDE commercial mixtures and related to predicted market place demand. BDE-209 dominated soil profiles, followed by BDE-99 and BDE-47. Although further research is required to gain baseline data on NBFRs in soil, the current state of scientific literature suggests that NBFRs pose a similar risk to land contamination as PBDEs.

2319,"Groundwater occurrence and flow patterns in the Ishiagu mining area of southeastern Nigeria The Ishiagu area is a water scarce region and has played host to mining activities for more than four decades. Mining-related activities have become a threat to potable water supply in the area. This paper is an attempt to show the extent of this threat and in particular, investigate the regional groundwater occurrence and flow pattern based on GPS, water well and geological data. This basin-wide model can be used for further groundwater assessment, pollution control and contaminant management. Groundwater occurs between 2.4 and 9 m in the LekwesiLokpaukwu area; 1.5-3.7 m in the Ndi-Ugbugbor-Ayaragu axis and 1.2-4.6 m in the Ishiagu area. Recharge areas include the Leru-Amaubiri-Lekwesi sandstone hills and the Ihetutu-Ugwuajirija mine field. While the ultimate sink of contamiants is the Ivo River system, other discharge axis is the Ishiagu-Ayaragu axis and the Ogwor Ndi-Ugbugbor zone. An unconfined and a confined (> 10) circulation groundwater system was inferred, and flow model reveals that a large part of Ishiag-Ayaragu and Ndi-Ugbugbor part of the study area suffer polluted recharge from the Pb/Zn mining area. Groundwater was also subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and the existence of 3-4 hydrological regimes, which revealed: Unpolluted recharge areas, areas affected by polluted recharge, a deep water and shallow water circulation and mine effluents.",
2320,"U-Mo mineralization potential in Pan-African granites, southwestern Cameroon: Economic geology of the Ekomedion prospect Uranium and molybdenum mineralization at the Ekomedion prospect of southwestern Cameroon occurs within pegmatite pods in Pan-African two-mica granite. The two-mica granite and the associated pegmatite experienced brittle deformation. Mineralization occurs as veinlets following early fractures and as irregular bodies intimately associated with pegmatite pods. Syn-tectonic alteration comprises albitization, silicification, ferruginization, seriticitization and chloritization. Mica in the ore zone is less magnesian and F-rich relative to mica in the host two-mica granite. Uraninite crystals are anhedral to subhedral and molybdenite is commonly encapsulated by phengitic muscovite. The two-mica granite is a strongly fractionated high-K, low P ferroan granite. The pegmatite pods hosting U-Mo mineralization are suggested to have been derived from the fractionation of magma parental to the two-mica granite as observed from Rare Earth Element (REE) patterns and the trend shown by Th/U ratios of the host granite and the pegmatite. This implies that uranium and molybdenum fractionated and concentrated preferentially into the late stage pegmatitic fluid that formed the pods and subsequently into the hydrothermal fluid phase. This therefore points to the two-mica granite as well as the metamorphic wall rocks as potential sources for U-Mo mineralization in southwestern Cameroon. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2321,"Investigation of meteoric water and parent fluid mixing in a two-phase geothermal reservoir system using strontium isotope analysis: A case study from Southern Bandung, West Java, Indonesia Determinations of the recharge area and recharge mechanism in geothermal systems are essential for reservoir management and a sustainable resource use. To address this problem, studies aplenty have aimed to identify the recharge elevation using stable water isotopes, 82H and 818O. Nevertheless, the physical and chemical processes involved in the generation of a reservoir fluid from a deeply infiltrated recharge flow remain poorly understood. This study aims to clarify this process using strontium (Sr) concentrations and isotope composition from water and well rock samples by selecting a geothermal field with a two-phase reservoir system in Southern Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. The water samples are characterized by variable Sr isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr) (0.70450-0.70725) and low Sr concentrations (0.01-0.72 ppm). The 87Sr/86Sr of the well rocks is also variable (0.70400-0.70827) with particularly high Sr concentrations (9.1-53 ppm). Three types of domain that are the combinations of the reservoir fluid mixing with groundwater are identified. The first two types are shallow and deep groundwater composed of 90 % meteoric water and 10 % upflow fluids with Sr concentration 0.01 to 0.11 ppm and the 87Sr/86Sr from 0.7055 to 0.70725. The shallow groundwater may possibly carry a 87Sr/86Sr anomaly (higher than 87Sr/86Sr of plagioclase: 0.7065) from the anthropogenic activities through the pathways created by the intersection of the NW-SE and NE-SW inferred regional faults in the west part of the field, hosted by the Wayang Windu Formation. The deep groundwater type is also a mixture of 10 % parent fluid hosted by the deeper aquifer rocks Malabar Formation, with lower strontium isotopes ratio than the first aquifer (87Sr/86Sr 0.7045-0.7055). The third groundwater refers to the perched aquifer with mixture of 30 %-70 % parent fluid that has undergone condensation and mixing processes in Pangalengan Formation (87Sr/86Sr 0.70452-0.7052). This groundwater is thought to be the source of mostly hot springs in the study area.",
2322,"Lead sorption by a Mexican, clinoptilolite-rich tuff GOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: The retention of lead by a Mexican, clinoptilolite-rich tuff from Oaxaca (Mexico) at different pH values was evaluated and the lead sorption mechanisms on the zeolitic material in this work were discussed. METHODS: Isotherms were determined using lead nitrate solutions (initial pH values between 2 and 5) at 303 K. After the equilibrium was reached, the content of lead in the liquid phases was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The elemental composition of the clinoptilolite-rich tuff before and after the lead sorption process was evaluated by electron microscopy. RESULTS: The maximum ion exchange capacity of the Mexican, clinoptilolite-rich tuff for lead was 1.4 meq/g at pH 3, considering an ion exchange mechanism in the absence of any precipitated or hydrolyzed lead species in the sorption process or any change in the zeolite network. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were also considered in this work for comparison purposes. DISCUSSION: It is important to consider the nature of the sorption processes before choosing a model to describe the interaction between the metal ions and the sorbent. CONCLUSIONS: The chemical lead speciation, the pH, as well as the characteristics of the clinoptilolite-rich tuff are important factors to be considered on the lead sorption process by natural zeolites. The chemical species involved in that process are Na, from the zeolite and Pb2+ from the aqueous solution at pH 2 and 3, so that the ion exchange mechanism explains the lead sorption processes by the clinoptilolite-rich tuff through the ion exchange isotherms. The sodium, Mexican, clinoptilolite-rich tuff is a potential adsorbent for lead from aqueous solutions. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The natural zeolite-rich tuffs are very important as ion exchangers for the treatment of polluted water due to their sorption properties and low cost. The sorption behavior of each natural material depends on their composition. Mexican, clinoptilolite-rich tuff from Oaxaca (Mexico) could be used for the treatment of waste water contaminated with lead. It would be important to propose this material as an alternative as waste water treatment, because it shows good selectivity for the removal of heavy metals from water.",
2323,"Groundwater quality evaluation with special reference to fluorosis and nitrate pollution - A case study Despite a semming abundance, Indias groundwater reserves are not inexhaustable. moreover the sustainable development of our groundwater resorces is increasingly threatened by Municipal, Industrial and Agricultural sources. As the public becomes increasingly concerned about water quality and quantity, a greater demand is placed on scientists to provide scientific information on which decisions regarding the health and management of water resources are based. This research paper describes the preliminary results of a study attempting to evaluate the long term water quality situation and health hazards in the eastern part of the Dharmapuri district,Tamil Nadu, India. The study also aimed at increasing understanding of the distribution of fluoride in the surface and groundwater, its source, its effects on human beings and animals, and proposing preventive and curative measures if possible. This study also indicated the occurrence of a high quantity of nitrate in the ground water samples. For this reason, the paper mainly deals with the Fluorosis problem and nitrate pollution in the study area. Fluoride concentration exceeding the desirable limit (0.6 to 1.2 mg/ltr) in sixteen samples is a major health hazard has lead to primary dental florosis amongst the villagers. All the samples showed more than 0.6 mg/ltr and six samples exceeded the highest permissible level of 1.2 mg/ltr. The nitrate concentration in seven groundwater samples exceeded the WHO maximum permissible limit of 45 Mg/litre. This was the first time such a high nitrate concentration in groundwater was observed in the region and it requires immediate action to provide safe drinking water for the rural community.",
2324,"Geochemical characteristics and sedimentary environment of the Middle Devonian organic-rich shales in the Northwest of Guizhong Depression, Southwest China In order to figure out the redox conditions and paleo-sedimentary environment of the Middle Devonian shales in the northwest of Guizhong Depression, the trace element analysis was conducted on the Middle Devonian cores (320.35-938.50 m) of the typical shale gas investigation well (GY-1) at a 1.50 m sampling interval through X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). According to the test result, the average values of V/(V+Ni), V/Cr and Ni/Co in Nabiao formation (Fm.) are larger than 0.67, 4.65 and 7.71 respectively, and Nabiao Fm. is rich in biological assemblages such as tabasheer, ammonite, etc. These evidences indicate the rising sea level rose relatively in the sedimentation period of Nabiao Fm. and a deepwater shelf environment, which was favorable for the preservation of organic matters. The V/(V+Ni), V/Cr and Ni/Co in Luofu Fm. and Tangting Fm. are 0.38-0.65, 0.73-4.10 and 3.70-6.72 respectively, indicating that the sea level dropped relatively in their sedimentation period, during which the water bodies became shallow, and the sedimentary environment was a weak oxidizing shallow water shelf environment. In addition, the variation of TOC has a high correlation with the enrichment degree of Ba element, indicating the favorable conditions for the enrichment and preservation of organic matters under an oxygen-deficient environment. Moreover, according to the identification of trace element indexes, the northwest of Guizhong Depression experienced the sedimentary cycle of relative rise to relative fall of sea level from bottom to top in the Middle Devonian sedimentation period. The relative sea level rose to the highest in the sedimentation period of Nabiao Fm., in which the organic-rich shales with stable thickness and high organic content were deposited. Hence, the Nabiao Fm. could be regarded as the favorable exploration target interval in this area. (C) 2020 China Geology Editorial Office.",
2325,"Life cycle assessment of run-of-river hydropower plants in the Peruvian Andes: a policy support perspective PurposeLow-carbon emissions are usually related to hydropower energy, making it an attractive option for nations with hydropower potential as it enables them to meet increasing electricity demand without relying on burning fossil fuels. In fact, the new wave of hydropower plant construction is occurring mainly in tropical areas where an additional environmental impact must be considered: biogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the degradation of biogenic carbon in reservoirs. Peru is planning to install up to 2000MW in hydropower until 2021, but the input and output flows, as well as the environmental impacts that these generate, have not been explored. Hence, a set of three hydropower plants built in the past decade located in the Peruvian Andes were analyzed from a life cycle perspective. The main objective of the study is to generate detailed life cycle inventories for each of these three hydropower plants with the aim of obtaining specific information for current conditions in Peru.MethodsThe life cycle assessment methodology was applied to compute the environmental impacts. Data collection was based mainly on primary data obtained directly from the hydropower companies, although biogenic emissions were modeled considering local net primary productivity conditions and other site-specific conditions. Although the calculation of GHG emissions related to hydropower plants was a priority, considering the important policy implications of decarbonizing the Peruvian electricity grid, other environmental categories, such as eutrophication or the depletion of abiotic resources, were also considered. The IPCC method was used to calculate GHG emissions, whereas a set of eight additional impact categories were computed using the ReCiPe 2016 method.Results and discussionResults show that GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated were in the lower range of emissions observed in the literature, in all three cases below 3g CO(2)eq/kWh. Biogenic emissions represented less than 5% of the total GHG emissions despite their location in a tropical nation, due to the arid conditions of the landscape in the Andean Highlands, as well as the mild temperatures that are present in the reservoirs. In terms of stratospheric ozone depletion, a GHG with ozone depletion properties, N2O, was the main source of impact.ConclusionsThe results are intended to be of utility for an array of applications, including relevance in decision-making in the energy sector and policy-making at a national level, considering the implications in terms of meeting the nationally determined contributions to mitigate climate change in the frame of the Treaty of Paris.",
2326,"Wastewater characteristics in Palestine Wastewater treatment plants in Palestine (West Bank and Gaza Strip) have been designed upon assumptions of wastewater characteristics and amount of flow, because no data were available at all. This study is focused on the collection and measurement of wastewater quantity and quality, which will be used as a basis for formulating a strategic plan for wastewater treatment in Palestine. In view of the limited water resources, reclaimed wastewater will be used for agriculture, which, at present, is done at a very limited scale. The infrastructure in Palestine used to be a neglected issue, particularly with regard to sewerage. Blocked pipes and flooded manholes are daily events especially in Gaza Strip. All existing treatment plants are heavily overloaded. Groundwater resources in Gaza Strip become more and more polluted with nitrate concentrations exceeding 100 mg NO3-N/I resulting from seepage from cesspits and effluent discharges into wadis. Due to scarcity of water, domestic water consumption is very low, which leads to highly concentrated wastewater similar to industrial one. In one city in the West Bank, the COD reached a value of 3,670 mg/l, although all the water reaching the outfall is of domestic type. Â© 1996, IAWQ. All rights reserved.",
2327,"Pathways from payments for ecosystem services program to socioeconomic outcomes Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is a widely accepted policy tool for achieving environmental conservation and socioeconomic development goals. However, the mechanisms through which PES programs affect socio-economic outcomes remain elusive. Here, we use a framework which integrates links between PES programs, livelihood activities, and socioeconomic outcomes, to determine how China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) has affected the incomes of participating households in the Yanhe watershed of the Loess Plateau. The results show that although the total effect of the GTGP on household income is not statistically significant, there are still two significant pathways. Through the analysis we found that implementation of the GTGP significantly increased the participations in local non-farm jobs, which leads to increased household incomes. Based on our findings, we suggest several ways of improving the socioeconomic outcomes of the GTGP through increasing non-farm work benefit of participating households, maximizing the positive effect of economic forest, and reducing the reliance of households on income from crop production. Our study provides a template for revealing the underlying pathways to socioeconomic outcomes of PES programs-crucial knowledge if we are to design and implement better PES programs and achieve the desired environmental conservation and poverty reduction goals.",
2328,"Levels of arsenic in the drinking water in Leales and Graneros (Tucuman-Argentina) The aim of this work was to investigate the contamination with Arsenic (As) in drinking water in Leales (L) and Graneros (G) (Tucuman), the relationship between the level of pollution and the depth of the wells, and the presence of cutaneous signs. The determination of As was made by the quantitative method of modified Gutzei. A hundred and twenty-two individuals were selected. A total of 9.3% and 34.7% of 140 samples of L and 95 of G respectively have allowed levels. The average concentrations in L were 0.112; 0.087 and 0.096 mg/L for depths lower than 10; 11 to 25 meters, and higher than 25 meters respectively. No difference was found between the different depths. The average concentrations in G were 0.163; 0.045; 0.405; 0.056 mg/L for the wells lower than 10; 11 to 25: meters with concentrations moderately and markedly raised, and higher than 25 meters respectively. Differences were found between the concentrations of As and the depth of the wells. A total of 12.4% of 89 of L and 39.4% of 33 individuals examined of G showed cutaneous signs. This pathology is of high importance in depressed areas of the Argentina, is linked to an inadequate provision of water.",
2329,"Preliminary studies of groundwater flow and migration of uranium isotopes around the Oklo natural reactors (Gabon) In specific zones of the Oklo uranium deposit, criticality was naturally reached 2 Ga ago. This site thus provides a unique opportunity to show whether the stable nuclear reaction end-products have remained or not in the vicinity of the reactor zones after the termination of nuclear reactions. In addition, the evaluation of the stability of the uraninite matrix over very long periods of time provides information on the possible long-term stability of waste forms such as spent fuel. The Commission of the European Communities initiated in 1991 the Oklo Natural Analogue Programme, a part of which is devoted to present-day migration studies. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) supports this programme, with special interest in the Bangombe reactor, a shallow reaction zone possibly affected by surficial alteration processes. The Oklo study comprises hydrogeology, groundwater chemistry, isotopic analyses (environmental isotopes, U series, U-235/U-238), and modelling. Two sites are being thoroughly investigated: the less perturbed OK84 reactor zone in Okelobondo (200 m south from Oklo) and the Bangombe reactor zone, 30 km south of Oklo. We focus our study on uranium migration from these reactor zones, using tracers such as the U-235/U-238 isotope ratio. After preliminary field campaigns, a conceptual model was constructed, both for Okelobondo and Bangombe. For this purpose, groundwaters have been characterised for three years in different areas around Oklo: Okelobondo groundwaters in mines and boreholes and surface waters, and Bangombe, both in boreholes and surface waters. Detailed investigations were then conducted in order to validate our conceptual models, and finally to enabling us to model U migration from the reaction zones, and to evaluate the performance assessment of deep geological disposal of radioactive wastes. After the presentation of regional and local geology and hydrogeology, we give a complete description and interpretation of groundwater chemical evolution both in Okelobondo and Bangombe. It concerns major-element behaviour, redox control and uranium behaviour. Preliminary conclusions for the conceptual model drawn from hydrogeological studies and from groundwater chemistry agree closely. In addition, we have successfully tested the use of U-235/U-238 isotope ratios in groundwaters to evaluate the migration of uranium from reactor zones.",
2330,"Performance evaluation of electrocoagulation process using iron-rod electrodes for removing hardness from drinking water Hard water causes many problems in domestic and industrial usage. The growing demands for water of high quality necessitate the development of modern and cost-effective technologies for softening hard and very hard waters. One of these techniques is the electrocoagulation process (EC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of EC process in removal of water hardness through iron-rod electrodes in different circumstances. This study was conducted as a pilot plant. Experimental water sample was taken from water distribution network of Anar City located in northwestern part of Kerman Province, Iran. The indices for calcium and total hardness removal in pH (3.0, 7.0, and 10.0), electrical potential of 6, 12, and 24 V and reaction times of 10, 20, and 30 min were measured. The maximum efficiency of hardness removal which was obtained in pH 10.0, voltage of 12 and reaction time of 60 min are equal to 98.2% and 97.4% for calcium and total hardness, respectively. Final pH of remained solution has also increased which rises with acidic pH and decreases in alcoholic pH, so the results demonstrate the direct effect of pH, potential difference and reaction time on hardness removal using EC process.

2331,"CHINESE-GERMAN COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE INLAND WATERWAYS IN SHANGHAI In and around Shanghai a rapid development of transportation systems could be observed during the last years. Opposite to this increase inland waterways have developed less quickly due to various restricting facts. Taking into consideration current prognoses for transportation of containers and bulk materials for the coming years, the necessity of a more important role for middle and long distance transport over waterways becomes clear. In specific for container transportation to the hinterland of the port of Shanghai, currently one of the largest ports worldwide, this seems an essential solution. The construction and improvement of the waterway system in and around the city of Shanghai is being planned to facilitate the container collection and distribution on main routes to the Chinese hinterland. Throughout the last years finding a balance between engineering measures and the ecological system has gained great importance worldwide. Strong efforts have been made lately in China as well in order to enable the realization of ecological measures along waterways allowing the settlement of flora and fauna along embankments and in the adjacent areas. New cross section layouts were developed, combining materials meeting structural and ecological demands at the same time. A Chinese-German cooperation project has been started in 2005 between the Shanghai Institute of Waterways (today China Communications Construction Group Inc.) and bremenports; GmbH & Co. KG to exchange experiences concerning the implementation of bioengineering measures in Europe and Asia. Ecological, efficient and sustainable approaches for waterway-planning used in Germany were introduced and possibilities of adaptation of these methods in China analyzed.",
2332,"Assessing Lignin Decomposition and Soil Organic Carbon Contents Across a Tropical Savannah-Rainforest Boundary in Guyana The soils beneath the rainforest of Guyana have the potential to hold, and release, large stores of carbon under land use and climate change. Little is known about soil carbon stocks or molecular dynamics in this region. This study therefore aims to elucidate differences in the molecular (lignin and tannin) and bulk soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in different 'sub-environments' along a rainforest-savannah boundary, setting a framework for further investigation into the soil carbon dynamics of the region. Bulk SOC analysis shows that Gleysols have the highest stocks, particularly those under rainforest vegetation (swamp and island forests surrounded by savannah), whereas Plinthosols have significantly lower SOC stocks. Texture and soil water content analysis indicates that predominantly clay soils play a role in high SOC stocks, whilst predominantly sandy soils prevent SOC stocks from accumulating. Clay and sand are present in both Gleysols and Plinthosols, to different extents. Analysis of lignin and tannin in surface soils of the sub-environments reveals clear differences in molecular composition. Heavily degraded lignin signatures in rainforest Gleysols suggests a surrounding physio-chemical environment which promotes their degradation. Conversely, Plinthosols beneath woodland within the savannah have the greatest amount of lignin and tannin products. The presence of the clay mineral kaolinite and iron oxide strengite in these soils indicates a low ability for protection or complexing of organic matter. Therefore, water content and microbial activity may play a more important role in the degradation of lignin and tannin, as well as the SOC stock. With the potential for future deforestation due to land use or climate change, the high lignin degradation of Gleysols indicates a vulnerability to savannah encroachment. Forest Islands isolated from the main forest biome are the most vulnerable to change, and could lose a significant proportion of their SOC stock in a transition to savannah.",
2333,"Antioxidant enzymes and inorganic elements in seeds and leaves of four potential medicinal plants from Pakistan Extracts of fresh seeds and leaves of four medicinal plants viz. Hygrophila auriculata, Moringa oleifera, Croton tiglium and Withania somnifera were analysed for some metabolically important enzymes, i.e., proteases (PRT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), total phenolic content (TPC) and some inorganic elements (Zn, Cu, Mo, and Se). The highest specific activities of PRT and SOD were recorded in the seeds of M. oleifera and those of POD in the leaf extract of W. somnifera followed by C. tiglium. However, the highest specific activity of CAT was observed in the leaf extracts of H. auriculata (46.27 units/mg protein) followed by M. oleifera (37.82 units/mg protein). The highest TPC was found in the leaf extracts of H. auriculata (0.68 gallic acid equivalents g/100 g fresh weight). Higher concentrations of Zn were recorded in the leaf and seed samples of all four medicinal plants as compared to the other elements analysed (Cu, Mo, and Se). Statistical analysis showed that the antioxidant and enzymatic activities were significantly (p < 0.05) different among medicinal plant, and leaf and seed extracts as well. It was concluded that tested medicinal plants showed a good comparative profile of antioxidant enzymes and elements that will be useful for further studies.",
2334,"Monte Carlo simulation-based probabilistic health risk assessment of metals in groundwater via ingestion pathway in the mining areas of Singhbhum copper belt, India Probabilistic health risk assessment was conducted for metal exposure through groundwater in mining areas of Singhbhum Copper Belt, India. The concentrations of metals showed notable spatial variation exceeding drinking water standards at some of the locations. Hazard Quotient revealed that chronic risks to the local population were largely contributed by Mn, Co and As. The 95(th) percentiles of Hazard Index (HI) calculated using Monte Carlo simulations showed that the HI for male, female and child populations was 2.87, 2.54 and 4.57 for pre-monsoon, 2.16, 1.88 and 3.49 for monsoon and 2.28, 2.02 and 3.75 for post-monsoon seasons, respectively. The Hazard Indices indicated that amongst the populations, risk was greater for child population and considering the seasons the risk was higher during the pre-monsoon season. The sensitivity analysis suggested that concentration of metals in groundwater and exposure duration were 2 most influential input variables that contributed to the total risk.",
2335,"Synthesis and characterization of an alpha-Fe2O3/ZnTe heterostructure for photocatalytic degradation of Congo red, methyl orange and methylene blue The leading challenge towards environmental protection is untreated textile dyes. Tailoring photocatalytic materials is one of the sustainable remediation strategies for dye treatment. Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3), due to its favorable visible light active band gap (i.e. 2.1 eV), has turned out to be a robust material of interest. However, impoverished photocatalytic efficiency of alpha-Fe2O3 is ascribable to the short life span of the charge carriers. Consequently, the former synthesized heterostructures possess low degradation efficiency. The aim of the proposed endeavor is the synthesis of a novel zinc telluride-modified hematite (alpha-Fe2O3/ZnTe) heterostructure, its characterization and demonstration of its enhanced photocatalytic response. The promising heterostructure as well as bare photocatalysts were synthesized via a hydrothermal approach. All photocatalysts were characterized by the X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron diffraction spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, the selectivity and activity of the photocatalyst are closely related to the alignment of its band energy levels, which were estimated by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Nanomaterials, specifically alpha-Fe2O3 and alpha-Fe2O3/ZnTe, were used for the degradation of Congo red (97.9%), methyl orange (84%) and methylene blue (73%) under light irradiation (>200 nm) for 60 min. The results suggested that with the aforementioned optimized fabricated heterostructure, the degradation efficiency was improved in comparison to bare hematite (alpha-Fe2O3). The key rationale towards such improved photocatalytic response is the establishment of a type-II configuration in the alpha-Fe2O3/ZnTe heterostructure.",
2336,"Post-earthquake outbreak of insecticide-associated conjunctivitis in a primary school of Lixian district, China: An epidemiological investigation OBJECTIVES: To describe the time course and characteristics of an insecticide-associated incident and highlight potential risks from similar outbreaks that may occur in other areas to enhance the preparedness of emergency physicians and other healthcare providers to deal with the sequelae of these events. STUDY DESIGN: Outbreak investigation METHODS: From 5 to 8 August 2008, an outbreak investigation was carried out among the affected primary school located in the refugee camp area of Lixian district, Sichuan, China. Affected pupils, parents, teachers and doctors working in the local medical stations were visited. Clinical checking, clinical treatment, epidemiological investigation and environmental investigation were undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 138 individuals were diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis, characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva and intense ocular symptoms such as redness, itching and mucus discharge. According to the results, all risk factors (i.e. drinking water, indoor air and the materials used in camp classrooms) were excluded except insecticide exposure. The characteristics of symptoms, distribution of cases and records of irregular insecticide spraying support the assumption that the conjunctivitis outbreak was associated with synthetic pyrethroid alphacypermethrin exposure. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that non-standard operating procedures in pest control could lead to disease incidents. Medical rescue teams should receive training and education in preventive techniques.",
2337,"Metabolomic Characteristics of Arsenic-Associated Diabetes in a Prospective Cohort in Chihuahua, Mexico Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) has been linked to an increased risk of diabetes, yet the specific disease phenotype and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study we set out to identify iAs exposure-associated metabolites with altered abundance in nondiabetic and diabetic individuals in an effort to understand the relationship between exposure, metabolomic response, and disease status. A nested study design was used to profile metabolomic shifts in urine and plasma collected from 90 diabetic and 86 nondiabetic individuals matched for varying iAs concentrations in drinking water, body mass index, age, and sex. Diabetes diagnosis was based on measures of fasting plasma glucose and 2-h blood glucose. Multivariable models were used to identify metabolites with altered abundance associated with iAs exposure among diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. A total of 132 metabolites were identified to shift in urine or plasma in response to iAs exposure characterized by the sum of iAs metabolites in urine (U-tAs). Although many metabolites were altered in both diabetic and nondiabetic 35 subjects, diabetic individuals displayed a unique response to iAs exposure with 59 altered metabolites including those that play a role in tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolism. Taken together, these data highlight the broad impact of iAs exposure on the human metabolome, and demonstrate some specificity of the metabolomic response between diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. These data may provide novel insights into the mechanisms and phenotype of diabetes associated with iAs exposure.",
2338,"Variation of runoff between southern and northern China and their attribution in the Qinling Mountains, China The Qinling Mountains are the geographical dividing line between north and south of China, climate and underlying surface changes have a profound impact on runoff in the Qinling Mountains. This study attempts to identify the difference in runoff changes of two rivers in the south and north of China's south-north transitional zone under climate change. The Pettit test and Mann-Kendall test were used to investigate the abrupt change and trend analysis on runoff in the Ba River watershed and Jinqian River watershed from 1960 to 2014. The coupled energy-water balance equation based on the Budyko hypothesis estimated the climate and landscape elasticity of runoff followed by attribution analysis of runoff in these two watersheds. The results showed that annual runoff in the Jinqian River (in the southern Qinling Mountains) and the Ba River (in the northern Qinling Mountains) exhibited a significant decreasing trend at P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively. Abrupt runoff changes occurred in 1989 and 1992 in the Ba River and Jinqian River, respectively. The attribution analysis showed that the change in potential evapotranspiration had little impact on runoff in the southern and northern Qinling Mountains. In contrast, the dominant factors leading to runoff reduction were the change in precipitation and catchment landscape. The contributions of climate change and land surface alteration to runoff changes in the Ba River watershed and Jinqian watershed were 38.08% and 61.92%, and 23.95% and 76.05%, respectively. This study can provide a scientific reference for water resource protection in the south-north transitional zone of China.",
2339,"MODELING STOCKS AND FLOWS OF CARBON AND NITROGEN IN A PLANTED EUCALYPT STAND In order to provide accurate assessments of the development of monoculture tree plantations, the generic process model TREEGROW has been developed (on the basis of the model TREEDYN). This dynamic simulation model represents tree growth, and carbon and nitrogen dynamics in single species, even-aged forest stands. It contains detailed descriptions of tree-physiological (photosynthesis, respiration, growth and renewal of biomass, etc.) as well as soil-biological (decomposition, N-mineralisation, humification, etc.) processes. Several computer runs demonstrate the temporal development of a eucalypt stand (in South China), from planting to maturity as a function of various environmental and harvesting conditions. Simulations particularly show the negative consequences of litter removal on soil fertility and hence on stand productivity. If applied to different climatic scenarios, the model shows that potential benefits to tree growth arising from anthropogenic elevated concentrations of CO, and other trace compounds in the atmosphere can be negated in the case of insufficient nutrient supply. In addition to these first applications, the model can be used to determine deficits in empirical data, to integrate empirical results of different disciplines, and to check the consistency of given data sets.",
2340,"Lake Chad : A Study of a Drying Freshwater Body Concern that the capacity of the Lake Chad to provide adequate water supply has drastically reduced in the last three decades, which led us to investigate what management actions have been employed to ensure sustainable use of the shared water system. Lake Chad is Africa's fourth largest lake with a maximum length of 25, 000 km(2) from a previous 388, 500 km(2) some 600, 000 years ago. During the last four decades, the Lake has been susceptible to increasing variability and irregularity in rainfall. Dry spell, excessive evaporation and sandstorm have impacted negatively on the water body. Consequently, the Lake has shrunk appreciably by up to 80 per cent in 1985 but reaching 19, 000 km(2) in 2001. Given the critical importance of the Lake, its capacity to ameliorate extreme aridity in a desert ecosystem, the Lake as a source of livelihood support to more than 20 million people, the Lake as habitat to a wide range of biodiversity, we assessed relevant case studies and references from accessible documentation pertaining to the Lake. We found that the Lake is under severe stress arising from several factors, which include drought. To reverse the trend and ensure sustainability, a deliberate and coordinated international action is required.",
2341,"A review of biological drinking water treatment technologies for contaminants removal from polluted water resources This paper is the first critical review of the technology of water treatment via biological process for contaminants removal from water resources. The biological process is considered the future for drinking water treatment, especially for developing countries. The main focus of the review is on single and integrated treatment technologies that have been studied for all types of drinking water resources, including surface water and ground water. These treatment technologies have the capability to treat contaminants in polluted drinking water resources, such as heavy metals, natural organic matter, inorganic non-metallic matter, disinfection by-products, endocrine disrupting chemicals and microbial contaminants. The potential threats and challenges of using the biological process for safe drinking water production also have been discussed, as this technology is a relatively new concept for safe drinking water production, and there have been very limited studies performed in developing countries.

2342,"The Effectiveness of Using Hyacinth Plant As Phytoremediation Agent On Paper Industry Liquid Waste Increasing number of industry in Indonesia lead to produce large amount of waste. If the waste is not treated by phytoremediation, it will pollute the environment. One method to overcome this problem is phytoremediation process. Phytoremediation is the use of plant to reduce pollutants in both organic and inorganic compounds as well as to remove the contaminants. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of water hyacinth plant in absorbing paper industry liquid waste. Observations were made with phytoremediation of time 0, 7, 14, and 21 days with 2 treatment ie treatment covered by plastic and treatment not covered by plastic and by 4 concentration dilution ie 100% liquid waste, 75% liquid waste, 50%, and 25%. The result should that after 21 days of water hyacinth can reduce the COD level with the highest efficiency level of 1.63%, then BOD of 4.29%.",
2343,"Inorganic and organic contaminants in drinking water stored in polyethylene cisterns This work evaluated the presence of contaminants in stored rainwater in 36 polyethylene tanks installed in two rural communities of the semiarid of Bahia, Brazil. Carbonyl compounds were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-UV), BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylenes) by gas chromatoghaphy (GC-FID), and trace elements by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Seven carbonyl compounds were quantified including acrolein (<3-115â€¯Âµgâ€¯L(-1)), which is considered a potent mutagenic agent, above the potability limit in 75% of the cases. Trace elements such as copper, zinc, barium, aluminum and lead, more frequently found, were also quantified, and lead (<0,56-99â€¯Âµgâ€¯L(-1)) was above the tolerable limit for drinking water of 10â€¯Î¼gâ€¯L(-1) in 73% of the cases. The results show that the stored water in polyethylene cisterns in the Brazilian semiarid region does not present satisfactory conditions for human consumption.",
2344,"Evaluation of different approaches for modeling effects of acid rain on soils in China Acid deposition is an environmental problem of increasing concern in China. Acidic soils are common in the southern part of the country and soil acidification caused by acid deposition is expected to occur. Here we test and apply two different approaches for modeling effects of acid deposition and compare results with observed data from sites throughout southern China. The dynamic model MAGIC indicates that, during the last few decades, soil acidification rates have increased considerably due to acid deposition. This acidification will continue if sulfur deposition is not reduced, and if reduced more rapidly than base cation deposition. With the Steady State Mass Balance model (SSMB), and assuming that a molar ratio of Ca2+/Al3+ < 1 in soil water is harmful to vegetation, we estimate a slight probability for exceedance of the critical load for present deposition rates. Results from both modeling approaches show a strong dependence with deposition of base cations as well as sulfur. Hence, according to the models, changes in emission control of alkaline particulate matter prior to sulfur dioxide will be detrimental to the environment. Model calculations are, however, uncertain, particularly because available data on base cation deposition fluxes are scarce, and that model formulation of aluminum chemistry does not fully reproduce observations. An effort should be made to improve our present knowledge regarding deposition fluxes. Improvements to the model are suggested. Our work indicates that the critical loads presented in the regional acid deposition assessment model RAINS-Asia are too stringent. We find weaknesses in the SSMB approach, developed for northern European conditions, when applying it to Chinese conditions. We suggest an improved effort to revise the risk parameters for use in critical load estimates in China.",
2345,"Colorectal cancer in the Linxian China Nutrition Intervention Trial: Risk factors and intervention results BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common cancers in economically developed countries and developing world. While dietary factors are associated with risk of CRC in the West and urban China, little is known about risk or protective factors in rural China. METHODS: The Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial (NIT) cohort was established over 30 years ago to test whether daily multivitamin/mineral supplements could reduce the incidence and mortality of esophageal/gastric cardia cancer. The cohort included a total of 29,553 healthy participants 40-69 years old who were randomly assigned to supplements or placebos via a 24 fractional factorial study design. We examined risk factors for the development of CRC as well as the effects of four different nutritional factors (Factor A: retinol, zinc; B: riboflavin, niacin; C: ascorbic acid, molybdenum; D: selenium, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene,) on CRC incidence following 5.25 years of supplementation in this randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial. RESULTS: CRC risk increased with age and height as well as piped water usage, family history of CRC, and consumption of foods cooked in oil, eggs, and fresh fruits. No effect on CRC was seen for any of these four intervention factors tested in both genders, but CRC was reduced 37% in females who received Factor D (selenium/alpha-tocopherol/beta-carotene) (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.43-0.92, P = 0.016) compared to females who did not receive Factor D. CONCLUSIONS: In this undernourished rural Chinese population, CRC risk factors in this Chinese cohort showed both similarities and differences compared to Western and urban Asian Chinese populations. Intervention results suggested a potential benefit for women supplemented with selenium/alpha-tocopherol/beta-carotene.",
2346,"Evaluation of the sensitivity of three cladoceran species widely distributed in Mexico to three reference toxicants Acute toxicity effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium pentachlorophenate (SPCP), and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) were determined in Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia pulex, and Simocephalus mixtus. Neonates were obtained from parthenogenetic females of different ages to establish the relative sensitivity of these species, in order to propose them as test organisms in the Mexican environmental standards. For C. dubia the average LC(50) (48 h) values were 8.59 +/- 1.08, 0.92 +/- 0.16, and 0.23 +/- 0.04; for D. pulex, 5.34 +/- 0.90, 1.49 +/- 0.29, and 0.28 +/- 0.06; whereas for S. mixtus, they were 4.50 +/- 0.41, 1.31 +/- 0.16, and 0.12 +/- 0.03 mg/L for SDS, SPCP, and Cr(VI), respectively. SDS and SPCP acute toxicity results depicted coefficients of variation of <or= 40 % that were not related to the age of mothers. The same was observed for Cr(VI) with C. dubia, whereas for S. mixtus and D. pulex a reduction in neonates' sensitivity was determined for progeny produced by females older than 23 and 25 days, respectively; this situation establishes limits to the useful period of the culture for the supply of test organisms from these cladocerans. The less toxic reference toxicant was SDS. S. mixtus was the most sensitive cladoceran to SDS and Cr(VI), whereas C. dubia was the most sensitive to SPCP. Although differences existed in the culture conditions and in managing the production of newborns, results suggest the feasibility of using D. pulex and S. mixtus as test organisms in acute toxicity assessment as surrogates of D. magna, an exotic cladoceran in Mexico. Considering its short life-cycle, C. dubia could be used in chronic toxicity tests, as well as in acute toxicity tests, having in both situations the advantage of requiring lower volumes of test samples.",
2347,"Environmental radioactivity and high incidence rates of stomach and esophagus cancer in the Van Lake region: a causal relationship? This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey. Further investigations with long-term detailed environmental radiation measurements are needed regarding the relationship between cancer cases and environmental radioactivity in the city of Van.",
2348,"Open defecation near a world heritage site: causes and implication for sustainable tourism and heritage management Purpose The sixth of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has access to improved sanitation as one of its targets. Sanitation is important not only for environmental quality and public health but also for the outstanding universal value (OUV) of heritage monument sites and tourism promotion. The study examined the causes of open defecation (OD) in the neighbourhood of a World Heritage (WH) site in Ghana and the implications of the practice for sustainable tourism and heritage management. Design/methodology/approach The study used the qualitative approach. Data were gathered from purposively targeted respondents (an Environmental Health Officer, Heritage Managers, a Tourism Expert, Hoteliers, Zoomlion Staff, Open Defecators, Community Opinion Leaders and Ordinary Community Residents) and analysed using the thematic approach. Findings It became evident that the causes of OD were: the lack of toilet facilities in many houses in the community, filthy and foul-smelling public latrines, poor attitude and heritage culture, mental and income poverty, inadequate sensitisation and a poor law enforcement regime. OD threatened the sustainability of heritage tourism and its associated livelihoods, as well as public health. In addition, it impaired the authenticity and integrity of the heritage monument, culminating in a detraction from the OUV of the heritage property. Practical implications In collaboration with the local, national and international stakeholders, the managers of the heritage monument should design and implement a comprehensive environmentally friendly plan. The plan should consider demarcating the boundaries of the heritage asset, monitoring the protected area, enforcing sanitation laws and mounting intensive sanitation education campaigns. It should also consider providing a decent toilet in the vicinity of the monument for the transit population, facilitate the provision of a toilet in every house through the community-led total sanitation approach, installing digital cameras at vantage points in the buffer zone of the castle to capture open defecators and punishing offenders severely to deter others from engaging in the ignoble practice of OD. Originality/value The authors argue that sanitation at heritage sites in developing countries merits further discussion within the WH network to promote sustainable heritage conservation management and tourism.",
2349,"[Determination of trace iodide in drinking water in Shanghai by two columns and gas chromatography with electron capture detection] OBJECTIVE: To modify and optimize gas chromatographic conditions, qualitative and quantitative method on the base of the actual national standard detection method for drinking water on testing iodide with gas chromatography, and detect iodide in drinking water of Shanghai. METHODS: Iodobutane derivative was identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, then two capillary columns coupled to electron capture detector were made by qualitative and quantitative analysis. Finally, 100 ml water samples were collected respectively from raw water and finished water of three plants in which water sources were Yangtse river, Huangpu river, and inner river respectively and detected by this developed method. RESULTS: The results of mass spectrometry showed that iodide would form iodobutane which could generate 1-iodo-2-butanone and 3-iodo-2-butanone isomers by derivatization. The data of qualitative analysis by two capillary columns revealed that iodobutane was separated completely and the total time of chromatogram separation was 19.33 min.3-iodo-2-butanone with the high response value was selected to quantitatively analyse. The linear range was 1 - 100 Âµg/L, and the coefficient of determination (r(2)) was 0.9997. The limit of detection was 13 ng/L. Recoveries were between 97.68% and 104.37%, and relative standard deviations were between 2.14% and 4.41%. The results of iodide detected by this method in raw water and finished water in three plants in Shanghai showed that the ranking of iodide's concentration in raw water was Huangpu river (15.14 Âµg/L) > inner river (6.97 Âµg/L) > Yangtse river (3.55 Âµg/L). The level of iodide in finished water of plant 1 (3.55 Âµg/L and 5.92 Âµg/L for raw and finished water respectively) and 3 (6.97 Âµg/L and 9.62 Âµg/L for raw and finished water respectively) increased slightly except for plant 2 (15.14 Âµg/L and 1.81 Âµg/L for raw and finished water respectively). The relative standard deviations of all water samples measured in duplicate were less than 9.73%. CONCLUSION: The improved method possesses higher degree of sensitivity and accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis than actual national standard detection method, and it is fit for trace analysis of iodide in water.",
2350,"An investigation of some causes of die-back disorder of pistachio trees and its control through balanced fertilization in Iran The incidence of die-back in pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) occurs extensively in pistachio orchards of Iran where it has caused yields to be low. In order to evaluate the spread per cent occurrences and to determine the causative factor(s) of this incidence, some 203 pistachio orchards located in Rafsanjan, Kerman, Yazd and Khorasan regions were visited during the period 2002-2004. It was noted that 4-90 per cent, or on average 28 per cent of the trees had been affected and that the rate of this incidence had increased by 60% during the ten-year period from 1994 to 2004. Soil samples from profile depths of 0-40, 4180 and 81-120 cm were collected in 31 randomly selected orchards for physicochemical analysis. Likewise, leaf samples as well as samples of irrigation water were collected in those orchards for chemical analysis. Then, correlations between the incidence of die-back and the examined factors were calculated. It was noted that the incidence of die-back in pistachio was positively correlated with soil EC, Na, K, SAR, Na/Ca and Na/K values. A stepwise regression analysis yielded this equation: Y = 51.799-0.194 (K)(soil) + 0.946 (SAR)(soil), R-2 = 0.737. On the basis of our research and reports by others, the fungus Paecilomyces variotti was found to be a causative agent of die-back in pistachio. A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted with 4 treatments and 6 replications on a total of twenty four, 25-year old trees of the pistachio variety Fandoghi, of which 40% was affected by the die-back problem in order to investigate the effect of balanced fertilizer application on preventing this incidence. The treatments included T-1 = the growers' conventional method (ammonium sulfate + triple superphosphate at the rate of 3 kg each per tree); T-2 = T-1 + potassium at the rate of 3kg potassium sulfate per tree; T-3 = T-2 + calcium applied as gypsum at the rate of 40 kg/tree; and T-4 = T-3 + zinc applied as zinc sulfate at the rate of 1500 g/tree. The direct fungal inoculation of the trees followed two years of the fertilizer treatments. The results showed a significant decrease (at 1% level) in the incidence of die-back with treatments T-2, T-3 and T-4 as compared with the farmers' conventional fertilization method. In other words, the application of potassium, calcium and zinc-fertilizers reduced this problem by 63 percent.",
2351,"Perfluoroalkyl Substances in Water from the Yangtze River and Its Tributaries at the Dividing Point Between the Middle and Lower Reaches The Yangtze River drainage basins are China's most important economic development zones and also the locations of several large-scale fluorine chemical industries. In order to reveal the contribution from the tributaries at the dividing point between the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River with respect to perfluorinated substances (PFASs), 17 PFAS compounds in surface water, groundwater, and tap water samples were analyzed in the tributary system of the Jiujiang section of the Yangtze River. The total concentrations of PFASs in the surface waters ranged from 7.8 to 586.2Â ng/L. High proportion of short-chain compound PFBS in surface waters in Nanchang City, Poyang Lake, and the Yangtze River was observed which is likely of WWTPs' origin.",
2352,"Purification of drinking water from Cs-134,Cs-137, Sr-89,Sr-90, Co-61 and I-129 The most probable and dangerous radionuclides which can appear in waste water of atomic power stations after accidents or terrorist acts are Cs-134.137, Sr-90, I-129. Moreover, the radionuclides Cs-137, 90Sr and Co-60 are also most attractive for terrorists to use in dirty bombs. As a result of the disasters the radionuclides can contaminate drinking water. Generally, tap water is decontaminated at water supply stations. Nevertheless it is very important to have sorbents and household drinking water filters in stocks to prevent panic of populace and consequences of emergency cases at the water supply stations. As the concentration of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CI- ions in potable water can have the value of 100-500 mg/l and the concentration of radionuclides is very low, the sorbents must have high selectivity and distribution coefficient of Cs+, Sr2+, Co2+, I- ions. Unfortunately most of known resins cannot be used for these purposes. The created technology of producing cationic and anionic exchange fibroid sorbents on the base of polyacrylonitrilic fibers is described in the paper. Chemical characteristics of the sorbent and filters were investigated. The static exchange capacity is 3-4 meq/g for cationic sorbents and 1-2 meq/g for anionic sorbents. The removal coefficient of listed radionuclides from drinking water by the filter is 10(2)-10(3). After the Chernobyl accident the Academy of Sciences and KGB of Ukraine tested the household filters with fibroid sorbents and ten thousands filters were produced in the Institute of Nuclear Physics of Uzbekistan and given to Ukraine through ""Isotope"" Corp. (USSR). The experience of using the filters for purification of drinking water from radionuclides in Chernobyl region is described in the paper. High technical and chemical characteristics of the sorbents have been confirmed by tests in certified labs of Germany, USA, Korea, India and Russia.",
2353,"Water treatment practices in rural Myanmar and residents' perceptions of technologies from donor countries Access to safe water is a significant issue in developing countries. Myanmar, a developing country in Southeast Asia, receives aid from many Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. Installation of point-of-use water treatment devices is an example of a water aid project to update the water infrastructure of the recipient country. However, research has tended to ignore the circumstances of the recipient. Usually, they already conduct water treatment and provide water for daily use; therefore, comparison of newly installed technology with currently used technology is important to achieve sustained use of the new technology. In this study, 99 households in a village near Yangon City were asked to complete a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire included basic household information, currently used local technology, and residents' perception of newly installed technologies from donor countries. The outcome of the study showed that local people were interested in higher water quality from both current and newly installed technologies, and they had different expectations of different donor countries. They were concerned about costs with all countries, but had different expectations for quality and ease of use from different countries. Analysis of specific technologies suggested that local people recognized the similarity of donor countries A ( Japan) and B (China), but they expected higher quality from donor A and lower cost from donor B. Further analysis regarding current technology implied that they preferred to receive, and were more willing to use, technology from donor country A than from donor country B due to perceived quality.",
2354,"High-throughput screening of cocaine, adulterants, and diluents in seized samples using capillary electrophoresis with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection Cocaine is one of the most frequently used illicit drug in the world. Therefore, the development of simple and fast methods for the detection of cocaine and common adulterants, diluents and impurities are extremely important in forensic investigations. The present study describes, for the first time, a method based on capillary electrophoresis with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-(CD)-D-4) for the rapid (2.5 min) and simultaneous quantification of cocaine, levamisole, lidocaine, carbonate, borate, chloride, nitrate, nitrite and sulphate. In the experiment, anions were separated in co-electroosmotic mode and cations in counter-electroosmotic mode employing a buffer solution composed by 10.0 mmol L-1 TAPS, 12 mmol L-1 NaOH and 0.2 mmol L-1 CTAB as the background electrolyte (pH = 8.8). The developed CE method demonstrated some interesting analytical characteristics such as: (i) a simple sample pretreatment step (only dilution in water and filtering), (ii) high-throughput screening (24 injections h(-1)), (iii) proper recovery values (between 72 and 118%), and (iv) an inter-day precision of less than 7% for all analytes. The procedure was successfully applied in the analysis of seized cocaine samples collected by the Integrated Forensics Post (PPI) of the Minas Gerais Civil Police (Uberaba, Minas Gerais State, Brazil), during the year of 2018.",
2355,"Risk Factors for Presumed Bacterial Pneumonia Among HIV-uninfected Children Hospitalized in Soweto, South Africa Background: Pneumonia is a leading cause of child morbidity and death. Data on risk factors can guide prevention efforts. Within a study on pneumococcal conjugate vaccine effectiveness, we investigated risk factors for presumed bacterial pneumonia (PBP). Methods: PBP cases were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uninfected children with lower respiratory tract infection and consolidation on chest radiograph or nonconsolidated infiltrate with C-reactive protein >= 40 mg/L hospitalized at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH) in Soweto. Age-matched community controls were identified using CHBAH birth records +/- 1 week of case birth date. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Results: A total of 889 PBP cases (median age 9 months) were matched to 2628 controls. Crowding was a significant risk factor among well-nourished children (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.89-2.78), but not in those with low weight-for-age. Malnutrition was associated with PBP; strength of association was highest in the absence of crowding (aOR: 6.68, 95% CI: 4.74-9.42). Exclusive breastfeeding was protective only among HIV-unexposed children (aOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54-0.78). Self-reported maternal HIV infection was a risk factor among children exclusively breastfeed up to 4 months (aOR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.53-3.55). Having indoor tap water was protective (aOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54-0.78), whereas a primary care giver who smoked was a risk factor (aOR: 5.15, 95% CI: 2.94-9.03). Conclusions: Our findings confirm several known pneumonia risk factors and highlight complex interactions between factors, including HIV exposure, breastfeeding, malnutrition and crowding. Improved housing, reduced secondhand smoke exposure and HIV prevention among women of reproductive age could lessen the child pneumonia burden.",
2356,"Plant Production in Controlled Environments Crop production in open fields is increasingly limited by weather extremes and water shortages, in addition to pests and soil-borne diseases. In order to increase crop yield, quality, and productivity, controlled environment agriculture (CEA) can play an important role as an alternative and supplemental production system to conventional open field production. CEA is any agricultural technology that enables growers to manipulate the growing environment for improved yield and quality. CEA production systems include high tunnels, greenhouses, and indoor vertical farming, as well as hydroponics and aquaponics. Currently, low-tech' CEA techniques such as high tunnels (plastic greenhouses with minimum or no cooling and heating) are primarily utilized in developing countries where labor costs are relatively low, and China has by far the largest area covered by high tunnels or Chinese-style' solar greenhouses. The most control-intensive high-tech' CEA approach, namely indoor vertical farming, has gained tremendous attention in the past decade by researchers and entrepreneurs around the world, owing to advancements in lighting technology, including use of light emitting diodes (LEDs), and increasing urbanization with new market opportunities. This special issue covers some of the CEA topics such as LED lighting, substrate, and hydroponics.",
2357,"Hadean Earth and primordial continents: The cradle of prebiotic life The Hadean history of Earth is shrouded in mystery and it is considered that the planet was born dry with no water or atmosphere. The Earth -Moon system had many features in common during the birth stage. Solidification of the dry magma ocean at 4.53 Ga generated primordial continents with komatiite. We speculate that the upper crust was composed of fractionated gabbros and the middle felsic crust by anorthosite at ca. 21 km depth boundary, underlain by meta-anorthosite (grossular + kyanite + quartz) down to 50-60 km in depth. The thickness of the mafic KREEP basalt in the lower crust, separating it from the underlying upper mantle is not well -constrained and might have been up to ca. 100-200 km depending on the degree of fractionation and gravitational stability versus surrounding mantle density. The primordial continents must have been composed of the final residue of dry magma ocean and enriched in several critical elements including Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, P, K, and Cl which were exposed on the surface of the dry Earth. Around 190 million years after the solidification of the magma ocean, ""ABEL bombardment"" delivered volatiles including H2O, CO2, N-2 as well as silicate components through the addition of icy asteroids. This event continued for 200 Myr with subordinate bombardments until 3.9 Ga, preparing the Earth for the prebiotic chemical evolution and as the cradle of first life. Due to vigorous convection arising from high mantle potential temperatures, the primordial continents disintegrated and were dragged down to the deep mantle, marking the onset of Hadean plate tectonics.

2358,"[Distribution Characteristics of Mercury in Different Urban Constructed Wetlands] To explore the spatial and temporal distribution and the methylation characteristics of mercury in different constructed wetlands in cities, and to understand the potential ecological exposure of mercury in urban wetlands, four artificial wetlands in Chongqing were studied from March 2017 to March 2018. The water samples were collected separately in four quarters, and the mass concentration of total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) was researched for one year. The results showed that the THg concentration in the four wetland waters is higher than the background value of the world's lakes and reservoirs for dam construction, but it is far lower than the waters with pollution history. The THg mass concentration of the water inside the wetlands is slightly higher than in the inlet and outlet. In addition, the THg mass concentration in the aquatic plant growing area, the construction area, the cruise ship parking area, and the frequent play area has an increasing trend, indicating that urban wetlands have a trapping and converging effect of the water's THg, so human activities influence total mercury a lot. The mass concentration of MeHg in the four wetland waters was slightly higher than that in other water bodies. With the exception of the Caiyun Lake, where the mass concentration of MeHg at the outlet was higher than that of the water inlet, the other three wetlands showed lower MeHg mass concentration in the outlet than the inlet. The mass concentration of MeHg in the wetland water increased with increasing water depth. The ratio of MeHg concentration to THg mass concentration (MeHg/THg) was higher than in other waters, indicating that urban wetlands have effect on net mercury methylation from waters. The photoreduction of mercury and its absorption by aquatic plants can reduce the mercury load from urban wetlands to downstream watersheds. The THg mass concentration of the four urban wetland water bodies was high in the spring and autumn, with a slight decrease in the summer, and lowest in the winter. The mass concentration of MeHg was the lowest in winter, and in the other three seasons it was basically flat, about three times higher than in winter. This study clarifies the temporal and spatial distribution and methylation of mercury in urban wetlands. It explores the degree of disturbance of human activities on wetlands and the response characteristics, as well as the impact of wetland mercury on downstream watersheds. To avoid potential mercury exposure, measures need to be established for the construction of artificial wetlands.",
2359,"Effect of irrigation on Fe(III)-SO42- redox cycling and arsenic mobilization in shallow groundwater from the Datong basin, China: Evidence from hydrochemical monitoring and modeling Seasonal hydrochemical monitoring has been conducted at a well-known arsenic (As) contaminated site to understand the critical controlling processes on As mobilization and enrichment in groundwater. The hydrochemical results indicate that the water chemistry at the studied site is mainly controlled by evaporates dissolution, and redox reactions during irrigation and non-irrigation periods, respectively. The measured redox-sensitive components indicate that the groundwater experienced periodic redox changes from irrigation to non-irrigation periods and that an enhanced reducing environment prevailed during the non-irrigation period. The observed high As concentration and the strong positive correlation between As and Fe support the conclusion that the Fe oxides/hydroxides reduction and Fe sulfide oxidation releases As during the irrigation period. However, the relatively low As concentration and the close inverse correlation between As, Fe and SO42- show that Fe(III) and SO42- reduction accompanied by the formation of Fe sulfide precipitates, retains As during the non-irrigation periods. The geochemical inverse modeling performed for the selected wells confirms that Fe oxide/hydroxide and Fe sulfide dissolution as well as siderite precipitation are the dominant processes related to the mobilization of As during the water evolution from the pre-irrigation to irrigation period, while Fe sulfide precipitation immobilize As during the groundwater evolution from the irrigation to the post-irrigation period. In general, the combined results of the hydrochemical monitoring and the geochemical inverse modeling support the conclusion that the Fe(III)-SO42- redox cycling induced by periodic irrigation practices controls the mobilization of As in groundwater at this site.

2360,"Early Jurassic granitoids from deep drill holes in the East China Sea Basin: implications for the initiation of Palaeo-Pacific tectono-magmatic cycle The timing of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate (PPP) subduction in East Asia, following the amalgamation of the North and South China Blocks (NCB and SCB), remains equivocal despite several investigations on the widespread subduction-related Mesozoic magmatism in this region. Here we report newly discovered granodiorites in the East China Sea Basin (ECSB) from deep boreholes (2945-2983 m), which yield SHRIMP zircon U-Pb age of 174 +/- 1.1Ma. The rock shows relatively high Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios, low contents of Ni, Cr, and MgO, and markedly negative values of epsilon Hf(t) (21.0 to -27.0). These geochemical and isotopic features are similar to those of the tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suites produced by the partial melting of the thickened lower continental crust. Our data, together with the ca. 190-180Ma I-type granites reported from the eastern Zhejiang-Fujian and Taiwan areas, lead us to conclude that the continental crust in the coastal areas of South China underwent some degree of thickening during the Early Jurassic. A comparison with the coeval magmatic rocks in South Korea and Japan suggests that a large NE-trending continental arc (ca. 190-170Ma) might have been constructed along the eastern margin of Asia at this time. Our study provides insights into the initiation of the Palaeo-Pacific tectono-magmatic cycle immediately following the consolidation of the SCB and NCB.",
2361,"Quantitative maps of groundwater resources in Africa In Africa, groundwater is the major source of drinking water and its use for irrigation is forecast to increase substantially to combat growing food insecurity. Despite this, there is little quantitative information on groundwater resources in Africa, and groundwater storage is consequently omitted from assessments of freshwater availability. Here we present the first quantitative continent-wide maps of aquifer storage and potential borehole yields in Africa based on an extensive review of available maps, publications and data. We estimate total groundwater storage in Africa to be 0.66million km3 (0.361.75millionkm3). Not all of this groundwater storage is available for abstraction, but the estimated volume is more than 100 times estimates of annual renewable freshwater resources on Africa. Groundwater resources are unevenly distributed: the largest groundwater volumes are found in the large sedimentary aquifers in the North African countries Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Sudan. Nevertheless, for many African countries appropriately sited and constructed boreholes can support handpump abstraction (yields of 0.10.3ls1), and contain sufficient storage to sustain abstraction through inter-annual variations in recharge. The maps show further that the potential for higher yielding boreholes (&gt;5ls1) is much more limited. Therefore, strategies for increasing irrigation or supplying water to rapidly urbanizing cities that are predicated on the widespread drilling of high yielding boreholes are likely to be unsuccessful. As groundwater is the largest and most widely distributed store of freshwater in Africa, the quantitative maps are intended to lead to more realistic assessments of water security and water stress, and to promote a more quantitative approach to mapping of groundwater resources at national and regional level.

2362,"Numerical Analysis of the Drilled Horizontal Drains Efficiency in Physical Slope Model: The Role of the Soil Water Retention Property Rainfall leading to a variation of the groundwater regime has been considered as a main factor that caused slope failures in many regions in the world, particularly in Tunisia, where roads were recently well damaged under intensive precipitations. The installation of drilled horizontal drain can be an improvement alternative technique which affects the flow path, reduces the pressure in the soil by reducing the groundwater location. This study examines the effectiveness of drilled horizontal drains to stabilize the residual slope in a physical model. This is conducted in relation to the water retention property of the soil. So, in this study, different types of soils characterized by their corresponding water retention curves were considered. Using the proposal model implemented in CODE-BRIGHT software, we discuss many of the issues of the drain's efficiency basing on the water pressure and the displacement field changes. The paper discusses also the role of the main parameters which characterize the water-retention of the soil, such volumetric water content at saturation and air-entry suction.",
2363,"Assessment of site effects of a shallow and wide basin using geotechnical information-based spatial characterization The site effects relating to the amplification of ground motion under earthquake loading are strongly influenced by both the subsurface soil condition and the geologic structure. For site characterization at the Gyeongju area in Korea, in this study, site investigations were carried out, including borehole drilling and in-situ seismic tests. In addition, geologic information of ground surface obtained by site visits and pre-existing site investigation data were combined into it geo-knowledge database. The subsurface of this area, which has a history of abundant historical earthquakes, is composed of an alluvial soil deposited tip to 40 in thick, overlying weathered residual soils, which rest on bedrock. A geotechnical information system (GTIS), based on it geographic information system (GIS) framework, was implemented to effectively determine the spatial geologic structure of the study area. The results indicated that the Gyeongju basin has a shallow and wide shape. Based on this GTIS, two-dimensional (2D) finite-element (FE) analyses were performed to evaluate the site effects related mainly to the subsurface geologic structure of two typical basin sections in the study area. The resulting seismic responses show that the earthquake ground motions were amplified during the propagation of shear waves through the soil layer overlying the bedrock, and the duration of shaking near the basin edges wits prolonged owing to the surface waves generated by interactions of shear waves with basin geometry. Furthermore, one-dimensional (I D) FE seismic response analyses for representative soil sites in the basin were additionally conducted. The results of the 2D seismic responses at most sites in the basin are similar, except for the sites near the basin edges, because the basin in this study is very shallow and wide.

2364,"Atomic spectrometry update. Clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages This annual review covers the literature on the analysis of clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages using atomic spectrometric techniques published in the year up to the end of October 2004. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the details of these publications. Our previous Update 1 covered the preceding year up to October 2003. This year, it is evident we are moving into a new phase with many more papers appearing that used dynamic reaction cells or octopole cells with quadrupole ICP-mass spectrometers to reduce isobaric interferences, which are so prevalent in biological applications. Innovation and development were also noted with a 'beam injection' system for FAAS and the extension of in vivo XRF determination to Ag and As. Speciation of As and Se remains topical and the increased complexity of the situation is now evident with additional species found, many of which still have to be identified. More than 30 years after the appearance of Itai-Itai disease, a consequence of Cd contamination of rice in Japan, it is evident that despite successful remediation work concentrations of Cd in rice are still greater than elsewhere in Asia. This, together with the continuing concern over As in drinking water in Bangladesh, illustrates the importance of vigilance in preventing such tragedies in the future. Abnormally high As concentrations found in fossil skeletons of dinosaur species have led to the suggestion that As toxicity could have contributed to the extinction of dinosaurs in the Chinese Province of Sichuan. Finally, it is appropriate to acknowledge that this is the last Update for which David Halls will be writing. It is not possible to do justice to all that he has contributed. David has written for every one of the Clinical and Biological Materials, Foods and Beverages ASUs since they were established in 1986 and was the Topic Group Coordinator for several years. His contributions are always carefully crafted and, with his long practical experience within the clinical environment, his insight and observations are given with common sense and often with considerable humour too.",
2365,"Analysis of the Distribution of Some Potentially Harmful Elements (PHEs) in the Krugersdorp Game Reserve, Gauteng, South Africa The Mintails Mogale Gold (MMG) and the Rand Uranium (RU) are two large-scale mining consortiums active in re-mining old tailings dams and dumps in Krugersdorp and are a source of mine discharge feed into the Krugersdorp Game Reserve (KGR). This has resulted in a noticeable accumulation of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) over a number of years. Efforts were implemented to interpret the concentration levels of PHEs in soils of the study areas of which a total of 36 georeferenced soil samples were collected (in triplicate) from the MMG, RU and KGR, including samples from farmlands and waterways adjacent to the mining sites. Samples were then analysed by both inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for 36 elements. From the 36 elements of this study, detailed evaluations of the occurrence of 12 selected elements were discussed. The geochemical landscape at the KGR is shown to be in flux. The major mediating influences on the behaviour of As, Co, Cu, Hg and Pb, as they enter the KGR largely in the form of acid mine drainage (AMD), are the geological substrate (mostly in carbonate form). Analysis of the soils showed high levels of contamination for As and Co in ppm. The mean maximum of As ranged from (5.00-170.30) with the highest level found in the Krugersdorp site. The mean maximum of Co ranged from (46.00-102.30) with the highest level found in MMG. All of these values were well above the recommended maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) values, i.e., As (15-20) and Co (20-50). The mean maximum values for Pb (12.40-92.30); Cu (18.50-115.30) and Hg (12.40-92.30) content in surface soils of all four segments studied falls well within the MAC range for agricultural soils i.e., Cu (60-150); Hg (0.5-5) and Pb (20-300).",
2366,"Uranium isotopes in carbonate aquifers of arid region setting Groundwater in arid and semiarid regions is vital resource for many uses and therefore information about concentrations of uranium isotopes among other chemical parameters are necessary. In the study presented here, distribution of U-238 and U-235 in groundwater of four selected locations in the southern Arabian peninsula, namely at two locations within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and two locations in Oman are discussed. The analyses of the uranium isotopes were performed using ICP-MS and the results indicated a range of concentrations for U-235 and (238) U at 3-39 ng L-1 (average: 18 ng L-1) and 429-5,293 ng L-1 (average: 2,508 ng L-1) respectively. These uranium concentrations are below the higher permissible WHO limit for drinking water and also comparable to averages found in groundwater from similar aquifers in Florida and Tunisia. Negative correlation between rainfall and uranium concentrations suggests that in lithologically comparable aquifers, climate may influence the concentration of uranium in subtropical to arid regions.",
2367,"Non-contact magnetometric diagnostics of potentially hazardous sections of buried and insulated pipelines susceptible to failure The article considers the non-contact magnetometric diagnostics (NCMD) of buried pipelines. In Russia, China, and other countries, the NCMD is used for gas and oil pipelines, water conduits, heating system pipelines, and other service bur-ied pipelines. The main task of the NCMD is the detection of the potentially dangerous sections of buried pipelines, on which, as a rule, it is impossible to carry out the in line inspec-tion. Based on the 20 years experience in the metal magnetic memory (MMM) method in 2000 Energodiagnostika Co. Ltd. began the development of the NCMD of buried pipelines using the specialized multi-channel highly sensitive flux-gate sensors. The NCMD is based on measurement of distortions of the magnetic field of the earth, conditioned by the variation of the pipe metal's magnetization in the stress concentration zones and in zones of developing corrosion-fatigue damages. Test results of buried pipelines by the NCMD are presented. A complex diagnostics of buried pipelines based on the NCMD with iden-tification of potentially hazardous segments and subsequent non-destructive testing in prospect holes is offered.",
2368,"Assessment of potability of minewater pumped out from Jharia Coalfield, India: an integrated approach using integrated water quality index, heavy metal pollution index, and multivariate statistics The dense and industrialized populace in the mining areas of Jharia Coalfield (JCF) is plagued by a severe shortage of water supply. The unutilized pumped out coal minewater discharges may be utilized to cater to the increasing water demand of the region but it runs the risk of getting contaminated from domestic and industrial effluents. The current study aimed to assess the suitability of augmenting underground minewater for potable purposes. For this purpose, ninety underground minewater samples collected from 15 locations across JCF for the hydrological year 2019-2020 were analysed to gain an insight on the physicochemical characteristics of the minewater using an integrated approach of standard hydrochemical methods, integrated water quality index (IWQI), heavy metal pollution index (HPI), and multivariate statistical analysis. For the minewater quality to be deemed suitable for potable purposes, both IWQI (lower than 2) and HPI (lower than 30) values were considered. IWQI values of the minewater samples from the study area ranged from 1.97 to 5.08, while the HPI values ranged from 18.40 to 53.05. The pH of the samples were found to be mildly acidic to alkaline (6.5 to 8.3) with varying total hardness (149 to 719Â mg L(-1)), total dissolved solids (341 to 953Â mg L(-1)), and electrical conductivity (568 to 1389 ÂµS cm(-1)), reflecting heterogeneity in underlying hydrosystems, variations in geological formations, and the influence of lithogenic and anthropogenic processes on the water chemistry of the region, which was corroborated by the principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the minewater samples. Two major water types of the region were identified, viz., Ca-Mg-HCO(3) and Ca-Mg-Cl-SO(4). This multiparametric approach gives a holistically accurate assessment of the minewater quality, overcoming the limitations of traditional water quality indices and facilitating time-saving and effective water management practices, and sets the foundation for augmenting minewater for potable purposes to meet increasing demands.",
2369,"Hydrological services: The need for the integration of space based information Enormous socio-economic and environmental requirements are forcing the water industry towards proper and more integrated management and efficient operation of water resources. This calls for more qualified and sustainable information systems and also for tools to assist them in the management of information. This paper discusses two different hydrological business cases, which have been investigated in the framework of an European Space Agency project (ESA, 2000), and explains the current status of water resources management and, in particular, the integration aspects of space technologies in respective cases. One hydrological service case represents the hydropower generation market. The integration of space based Earth Observation information has been investigated to optimise the operational procedures of a hydropower chain in the Austrian Danube within a de-regulated energy market. The second hydrological service case describes a river basin management system covering agriculture, forestry, environment, flood and risk management as well as water resources management within a shared watercourse. The Limpopo River in Mozambique has been selected as a representative example. A business plan approach revealed, that the use of remote sensing leads to the economically most attractive solution, when compared with conventional monitoring and ground-based survey methods.",
2370,"Ocean temperature responses to Typhoon Mstsa in the East China Sea The MASNUM wave-tide-circulation coupled model, with 21 layers in the vertical and (1/8)degrees horizontal resolution, was employed to investigate the oceanic responses to Typhoon Mstsa which traversed the East China Sea (ECS) during the period of 4 similar to 6 August, 2005. Numerical experiment results are analyzed and compared with observation. The responses of the sea surface temperature (SST), in a focused area of (27 degrees similar to 29 degrees N, 121 degrees similar to 124 degrees E), include heating and cooling stages. The heating is mainly due to warm Kuroshio water transportation and downwelling due to the water accumulation. In the cooling stage, the amplitude of the simulated cold wake (similar to 3 degrees C), located on the right side of this typhoon track, is compared quite well with that of the satellite observed SST data. The wave-induced mixing(Bv) plays a key role for the SST cooling. Bv stilt plays a leading role, which accounts for 36%, for the ocean temperature drop in the upper ocean of 0 similar to 40 m, while the upwelling is responsible for 84% of the cooling for the lower layer of 40 similar to 70 m. The mixed layer depth (MLD) increased quickly from 28 to 50 m in the typhoon period. However, the simulated MID without the wave-induced vertical mixing, evolution from 13 to 32 m, was seriously underestimated. The surface wave is too important to be ignored for the ocean responses to a typhoon.",
2371,"Groundwater vulnerability and trace element dispersion in the Quaternary aquifers along middle Upper Egypt Association of trace metal concentrations in water is problematic; however, its information is scarce and sometimes contradicted. This work presents variations in dissolved major constituents and trace element concentrations along the quaternary aquifers located in middle Upper Egypt (Minia and Assiut governorates). A total of 205 groundwater samples from these aquifers were collected. Auxiliary parameters (pH, alkalinity, and conductivity), major cations (Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+), and K(+)), dominant anions (HCO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-), Cl(-), and NO(3)(-)), and trace element (B, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Cr) concentrations were measured in all samples. Univariate (correlation coefficient and scatter matrix) analysis was employed combined with multivariate (principal coordinates analysis) analysis to identify the chemical characteristics of groundwater that are responsible for generating most of the variability within the dataset. Also, hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to classify the geochemical origin of the groundwater constituents. The results indicate that the groundwater pollution is mainly due to water-rock interactions, including aquifer matrix dissolution, redox reaction of trace metals, input from wastewater, and agricultural fertilizers.",
2372,"Treatment of fluoride-contaminated water. A review Delivering the right amount of fluoride to drinking water protects the teeth from decay and reduces the risk of cavities. Nonetheless, fluorosis has been diagnosed as the result of excessive exposure of fluoride, which induces brain impairment, muscle disorders and hyperactivity. Fluoride ingestion during the formation of the tooth enamel is the main reason for fluorosis, which is characterized by hypomineralization. Dissolution of fluoride-containing rock minerals contributes to naturally occurring fluoride contamination in water. The intentional addition of fluoride to water in dental care is alarming in growing countries such as India. This article reviews the origin of fluoride, the analysis of fluoride derivatives and the technologies to remove fluoride from water. The manuscript presents adsorption techniques for fluoride removal, using different types of adsorbents. The adsorption capacities of adsorbents under various conditions, such as contaminant concentration, adsorbent dosage, time, pH and temperature, are presented. Adsorbent types include alumina, zeolites, organic waste, shell-based and carbon-based including graphite and carbon nanotubes. Defluoridation of water using clays and muds, modified activated alumina, chitosan derivatives and composites are also discussed.",
2373,"The sustainability of water resources in High Mountain Asia in the context of recent and future glacier change High Mountain Asia contains the largest volume of glacier ice outside the polar regions, and contain the headwaters of some of the largest rivers in central Asia. These glaciers are losing mass at a mean rate of between -0.18 and -0.5 m water equivalent per year. While glaciers in the Himalaya are generally shrinking, those in the Karakoram have experienced a slight mass gain. Both changes have occurred in response to rising air temperatures due to Northern Hemisphere climate change. In the westerly influenced Indus catchment, glacier meltwater makes up a large proportion of the hydrological budget, and loss of glacier mass will ultimately lead to a decrease in water supplies. In the monsoon-influenced Ganges and Brahmaputra catchments, the contribution of glacial meltwater is relatively small compared to the Indus, and the decrease in annual water supplies will be less dramatic. Therefore, enhanced glacier melt will increase river flows until the middle of the twenty-first century, but in the longer term, into the latter part of this century, river flows will decline as glaciers shrink. Declining meltwater supplies may be compensated by increases in precipitation, but this could exacerbate the risk of flooding.",
2374,"China's toxic informal e-waste recycling: local approaches to a global environmental problem Electronic waste or e-waste has been an increasingly severe problem over the last decade, and is the fastest growing waste stream in the world. China's inexpensive labour and manufacturing abilities have already made it ""the world's factory"" and for e-waste recycling it is no exception. Informal workers do the majority of e-waste collection and recycling in cities throughout China. E-waste recycling work provides livelihoods for migrant workers and the urban poor and has formed a well-established shadow economy. The improper dismantling and burning of e-waste for resource recovery exposes workers to toxins and heavy metals, and causes severe air, water, and soil contamination. The illegal global trade of e-waste makes it a transboundary environmental governance problem of local and global scales. This paper investigates informal workers' knowledge of the environmental impacts of e-waste, perceptions of their work and whether they would be receptive to government regulation of recycling work. It finds that informal recyclers interviewed lack environmental awareness of the dangers related to e-waste recycling and are unwilling to be regulated due to fear of losing jobs and profits through regulation. Weak e-waste legislation and social marginalization are also major barriers to protecting e-waste recyclers and the environment. Through a scalar analysis of environmental governance, this paper proposes strengthening the roles of small enterprises and inclusion of Non Governmental Organization (NGOS) and Government Organized NGOS (GONGOs) to work in the informal sector to find safer recycling solutions to fill the large gap between legislation and de facto practices.

2375,"Heavy metal concentration in groundwater from Besant Nagar to Sathankuppam, South Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India The assessment of groundwater quality is an obligatory pre-requisite to developing countries like India with rural-based economy. Heavy metal concentration in groundwater from Besant Nagar to Sathankuppam, South Chennai was analyzed to assess the acquisition process. The study area has rapid urbanization since few decades, which deteriorated the condition of the aquifer of the area. Totally 30 groundwater samples were collected during pre-monsoon (June 2014) and post-monsoon (January 2015) from the same aquifer to assess the heavy metal concentration in groundwater. Groundwater samples were analyzed for heavy metals such as Fe, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Co and Mn using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Correlation matrix revealed that there is no significant correlation between heavy metals and other parameters during pre-monsoon except EC with Cr but Fe and Zn have good positive correlation during post-monsoon.",
2376,"Characterizing landscape pattern and ecosystem service value changes for urbanization impacts at an eco-regional scale This paper qualitatively examined urbanization impacts at an eco-regional scale by analyzing landscape pattern and ecosystem service value changes in four eco-regions in the Hang-Jia-Hu region (China): the Hang-Jia-Hu Plains agricultural eco-region (region 1), the Tianmu Mountain forest eco-region (region 2), the Hangzhou urban eco-region (region 3), and the Qiandao Lake watershed forests-wetlands eco-region (region 4). Our results showed that the four eco-regions exhibited a similar urbanization process of rapid population growth, economic development and urban expansion. The considerable urban expansion led to a loss of 8.5 billion RMB yuan ecosystem service values per year on average between 1994 and 2003. The problems associated with urbanization were namely that the level of the landscapes within regions 1, 2, and 3 became increasingly more diverse, irregular, fragmented and isolated. Region 4 presented the opposite trend. Multivariate regression further qualitatively explored the dynamics of landscape changes in response to urbanization as well as the interactions between landscape pattern and ecosystem service values. It was found that landscape fragmentation, configuration and diversity, which were induced by urbanization, could significantly impair the provisions of ecosystem services. By discussing the inside meaning of the obtained regression models, we also discussed some implications for landscape planning. Our results highlighted the significance of joint application of landscape metric analysis and ecosystem service values assessment in landscape planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2377,"The makings of a water crisis Globally, almost all of the water is salty, with only 2.5% being freshwater. Two-thirds of this freshwater is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover, while one-third consists of groundwater, which is more or less accessible. In 1995, consumption of water reached 2300 cu. km, most of which went to agriculture, industries, and municipalities. The demand for freshwater has more than doubled since the start of the century and the yearly per capita potential availability of renewable freshwater has been declining steadily. At the same time, the proportion of available but polluted water continuously increases, particularly because of changes in the modes of industrial and agricultural production and increasing urbanization. In quantifying freshwater scarcity, the use of the Â¿water stress indexÂ¿ (the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability) is a conservative estimation of water shortage. Almost all of the developing countries are experiencing scarcity of water resources, and importation of stocks, desalinization, and the use of nonrenewable water resources are deemed necessary. Population growth, economic development, and limitation on the financial and technical know-how further exacerbate this situation. With the existing serious water problems facing one-third of the population, it can be expected that the proportion would most probably double by 2025 if the trends continue. eng",
2378,"Fully coupled analysis of consolidation by prefabricated vertical drains with applications of constant strain rate tests: Case studies and an open-source program The paper proposes a new approach to use measured data of the constant strain rate test (CRST) for analysis of consolidation by prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs). Each PVD has an influence zone that idealised as a unit cell. Consolidation behaviour of a unit cell is studied with an axisymmetric finite element (FE) model based on Bias theory. From a CRST data, ASTM-D4186 or the back-analysis method is used to obtain stress-dependent parameters for the model. An open-source FE software named CONAXIS was developed for these purposes. Data from two projects in Mekong Delta Vietnam were used in this study. In the first project, nine CRSTs with various depths from a borehole were conducted. Two tests were chosen to be simulated using the proposed approach implemented in CONAXIS and the soft soil model in PLAXIS for validation and comparison purposes. Comparing to the laboratory data, CONAXIS gave more accurate results than PLAXIS. Then CONAXIS was used to calculate the settlement of the ground surface during the construction process with different scenarios. For the second project, six CRSTs from three boreholes were used to set up the model in CONAXIS. Modelled results of both projects showed good agreements with field monitoring data.",
2379,"A review of the issues and treatment options for wastewater from shale gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing Since the beginning of this millennium, shale gas extraction by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has boosted U.S. gas production, changing the global energy markets and leading to low natural gas and oil prices. Following the expansion of this industry, other countries such as U.K., Poland or China are exploring and supporting its extraction as a way to secure energy independence in an increasingly unstable geopolitical context and as an effective transition substitute for coal while moving towards a renewable energy market. However, there are important environmental concerns associated to shale gas production including atmospheric pollution and air quality issues, risks of water pollution and nuisance to the population caused by road traffic and noise. Water management is one of the most challenging problems since hydraulic fracturing requires millions of liters of water and produces high volumes of liquid effluents at variable compositions and rates. The present review focuses on the characteristics of this wastewater and the options existing to minimize its environmental impacts. At the moment, deep well injection and re-use are the most commonly employed strategies for this wastewater in the U.S. but the stricter regulations in other regions will require further treatment. Partial treatment and reuse is the preferred option where feasible. Otherwise, techniques such as mechanical vapor compression, thermal distillation or forward osmosis may be needed in order to meet the requirements for discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2380,"Evaluation of controls on silicate weathering in tropical mountainous rivers: Insights from the Isthmus of Panama The Isthmus of Panama comprises a lithologically diverse andesitic oceanic arc of Late Cretaceous to Holocene age; it has large spatial variation in rainfall, displays a large range of physical erosion rates, and, therefore, is an ideal location to examine silicate weathering in the tropics. We use a multiyear data set of river chemistry for a 450 km transect across the Cordillera Central of west-central Panama to investigate controls on chemical weathering in tropical small mountainous rivers. Sea-salt corrected cation weathering yields (Ca-sil + Mg-sil + Na + K) range over more than an order in magnitude from 3.1 to 31.7 t/km(2)/yr, while silicate weathering yields (Ca-sil + Mg-sil + Na + K + Si) range from 6.9 to 69.5 t/km(2)/yr. Watershed lithology is the primary control on riverine chemistry, but landscape topographic character and land cover and/or land use also influence solute delivery potential. Strong statistical links of small mountainous river chemical weathering fluxes with rainfall and physical weathering rates attest to the importance of runoff and erosion in maintaining elevated bedrock weathering rates. CO2 consumption ranges from 155 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr to 1566 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr, in the upper range of global rates, leading us to suggest that andesite terrains should be considered separately when calculating removal of CO2 from the atmosphere via silicate weathering.",
2381,"Bioremediation of Acid-Mine Drainage contaminated with acid and heavy metals in coal mine by Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria Acid-Mine Drainage (AMD) that releases highly acidic, sulfate, and metals-rich waste is a severe environmental problem, contaminating surface and groundwater as well as soils in coal mining districts in China. In this study, Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria (SRB) was isolated from the loess polluted by Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) from coal wastes. The aim of the test is to study the possibility of using SRB for preventing acid and heavy metals pollution from coal wastes, which is considered to be the major environmental problem associated with coal mining activities. Tests were conducted to determine if the SRB could be used for increasing pH and the immobilization of soluble heavy metals of AMD from coal wastes. We investigated the mechanisms of preventing acid and heavy metals from coal waste by sulfate-reducing bacteria and effect of the dosage of carbon source on controlling acid and heavy metals contamination. The results show that SRB can effectively enhance pH and immobilize iron, cadmium and zinc of acid mine drainage from coal wastes. The 1% dosage of carbon source is suitable.",
2382,"Evaluation on the environmental radioactivity in Shanghai city during the normal operational condition of Qinshan nuclear power station The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of environmental radioactivity in Shanghai from the operation of Qinshan Nuclear Power Station (QNPS). The levels of terrestrial gamma radiation and radioactivities in the drinking water, main food and soils in the Jinshan area where is only 38 km far away from the QNPS were continuously measured in the past 19 y. Both the levels of terrestrial gamma radiation and the radioactivities in the samples were on the normal background levels. No significant changes were found before and after the running of QNPS. The annual public exposure to the terrestrial gamma radiation was estimated to be âˆ¼0.1 mSv, and the annual exposure from intakes of (90)Sr and (137)Cs in food was âˆ¼0.5 Î¼Sv. In the past 19 y, no significant impact on the environmental radioactivity in Shanghai was observed due to the operation of QNPS.",
2383,"Fall of the iron curtain: male life expectancy in Slovakia, in the Czech Republic and in Europe Year 1989, the fall of communism, represents a dramatic watershed. Changes and reforms reflected also upon the quality of health care and the health of populations living on eastern side of the divide. Until then, Eastern Europe had free socialized medicine, albeit troubled by lack of up-to-date medications and absence of modern diagnostic equipment. Noting the admirable progress in health in some regions of the former Soviet empire during its transformation provides invaluable sociological lesson. Furthermore, focusing on health trends in two Central European countries, the Czech republic (CZ) and Slovakia (SK), brings about another quality to such evaluation. Dramatic improvement in the life expectancy (LE) is represented mainly in the decrease of cardiovascular mortality, more in the Czech Republic than in Slovakia. Favorable trend of male LE in the Czech Republic exceeded several established West European countries, while in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine the life expectancy actually deteriorated. When life expectancy in Slovakia is compared with the Czech Republic, its poorer outcome results from a higher cardiovascular mortality, as well as from liver, digestive and respiratory disorders. Root causes of this difference are possibly in a marked difference in funding of health care between SK and CZ, higher consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, as well as in a sizeable disadvantaged Roma minority in Slovakia.",
2384,"Acceleration of saturated porous media clogging and silicon dissolution due to low concentrations of Al(III) in the recharge of reclaimed water The recharge of reclaimed water is an effective strategy for addressing the issues of water quality deterioration and groundwater level decline simultaneously. Residual Al coagulants are normally remained in the recovered water at low concentrations, and may induce clogging problems during the recharging process. However, this issue has been ignored in the past. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Al(III)-induced aquifer bio-clogging, the role of Al(III) in quartz sand media (SiO(2)) dissolution and re-precipitation in the series of aquifer columns. We determined that Al(III) resulted in serious clogging in âˆ¼140â€¯h at low concentrations that satisfied the national drinking water standard of China. The corresponding hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than âˆ¼90% in the bacteria-containing aquifer, which was âˆ¼30% greater than that for the bacteria-free trials. The enhanced Al(III)-related clogging was caused by modifying quartz sand to form Si-O-Al(OH)n and improving microbes attachment. Microbes retention kinetic coefficients (k) of the Al recharged simulated aquifer could increase by 3.0-8.3 times. The Al(III) also enhanced biomass production and clogging by binding to microbial extracellular polymeric substances. In turn, the greater amount of biomass accelerated the Si dissolution and re-precipitation, this may potentially damage the stability of aquifer structure. The results showed that reclaimed water treated with Al coagulation should be employed with caution for recharging.",
2385,"Distribution, Sources, and Water Quality Assessment of Dissolved Heavy Metals in the Jiulongjiang River Water, Southeast China In this study, the concentration of eight dissolved heavy metals (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Mo, Sb, and Ba) in 42 water samples from the Jiulongjiang River, southeast China, were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Multivariate statistical methods, including correlation analysis (CA) and factor and principal component analysis (FA/PCA), were analyzed to identify the sources of the elements. Water quality index (WQI) and health risk assessment, including hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI), were used to evaluate water quality and the impacts on human health. Our results were compared with the drinking water guidelines reported by China, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), revealing that Ti, Mn, and Sb were not within approved limits at some sites and might be the main pollutants in the drainage basin. Based on the spatial distributions, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Mo showed good similarity, indicating that they might come from similar sources along the river. The CA results also showed that Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Mo had a high correlation coefficient. The FA/PCA results identified three principal components (PC) that accounted for 79.46% of the total variance. PC 1 suggested that a mixed lithogenic and urban land source contributed to Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Mo; PC 2 showed that Cr, Ni, and Mo were influenced by the discharge of industrial effluents; Sb had a strong loading on PC 3, which was controlled by mining activities. The results of the WQI indicated that the water in the Jiulongjiang River was basically categorized as excellent water, but the water quality levels in site W5 and N4 were poorer due to urban land use. Hazard quotient and HI values showed that Sb was a potential threat to human health, indicating that preventive actions should be considered in regard to mining activities in the upper reaches of Beixi stream.",
2386,"Hydrothermal activity in the Tulancingo-Acoculco Caldera Complex, central Mexico: Exploratory studies Mineral alteration and fluid inclusion studies of drill cuttings and core samples indicate that the sedimentary basement rocks and the volcanic rocks associated with Tulancingo-Acoculco Caldera Complex have been the site of two distinct and major hydrothermal events. The complex, located in the eastern portion of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, is formed by the Pliocene Tulancingo Caldera and the younger (Pleistocene) Acoculco Caldera, which developed within the older depression. The volcanic rocks are underlain by Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The earliest important hydrothermal event occurred during the emplacement of Mid-Tertiary granitic intrusions that metamorphosed the sedimentary rocks; these intrusives are not exposed at the surface. However, granitic rocks were encountered at the bottom of exploratory borehole EAC-1, drilled within the Caldera Complex. The second main event occurred during the formation of the Tulancingo and Acoculco Calderas. Both episodes lead to secondary mineralization that reduced the permeability of the reservoir rocks. A possible third hydrothermal event may be associated with the recent magmatic activity within the Acoculco Caldera. Thermal logs from well EAC-1 display a conductive thermal gradient with maximum temperatures exceeding 300 degrees C at 2000m depth. Although there are no active thermal springs in the area, there is extensive fossil surface hydrothermal alteration and cold gas discharges with high He-3/He-4 ratios.

2387,"Evaluation of nitrogen best management practices for potato production in Northeast Florida Best Management Practices (BMPs) have been developed by state regulatory agencies to reduce nitrate non-point source pollution in the St. Johns River watershed from potato production in the Tri-County Agricultural Area (TCAA) near Hastings, Florida. A project was developed to determine whether legumes planted as summer cover crops and/or fall cash crops could supply nitrogen to a spring potato crop reducing the need for inorganic nitrogen fertilizer. The experiment was designed as a 2 x 2 x 5 factorial design with four replications. Summer cover crop main factors were sorghum-sudan grass (Sorghum vulgare x Sorghum vulgare var. sudanese, var. SX17) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata, var. Iron Clay). Fall treatment factors were green bean (Phaseolus vulgarus, var. Stallion) and fallow. Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L., var. Atlantic) were planted on 28 February, 2001 and fertilized at five nitrogen rates (0, 112, 168, 224, 280 kg/ha). Potatoes were irrigated with seepage irrigation during the season. Potatoes were harvested and graded with commercial equipment into five size classes on 1 June, 2001. Total potato yield for the sorghum and cowpea main cover crop plots were not significantly different at 31.8 and 31.4 MT/ha, respectively. Total tuber yield for the green bean and fallow fall treatments were not significantly different at 31.8 and 29.6 MT/ha, respectively. However, potato plants in the green bean-0 kg N ha(-1) treatment produced approximately 10 MT ha(-1) more total and marketable tuber yield than the fallow-0 kg ha(-1) treatment. Although this was the first year of a three-year study and a transitional period between a traditional system and an alternative system, results suggest that legumes planted in sequence with potatoes may help growers reduce dependence on inorganic nitrogen sources without sacrificing production.",
2388,"Impact of leachate generated in the municipal landfill of Linares (Nuevo Leon) on the quality of surface water and groundwater This research deals with the quality of natural waters affected by pollution from leachate generated in the Municipal Landfill of Linares, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The Municipal Landfill of Linares has more than 17 years of service and receives more than 50 ton/day of municipal solid waste. Geological (geological structural profiles), hydrogeological (piezometric cards) and hydrogeochemical (water quality classification and determination of pollutants) methods were applied to identify external agents to the environment. A negative impact on the quality of surface water (dam El Cinco) and groundwater (wells) in accordance with national and international environmental standards (NOM, WHO, US EPA) were identified. The results reveal deficiencies in the management and final disposal of municipal solid waste (torn geomembrane) and null leachate management (oversaturation of the landfill). In particular, high concentrations of NO3, Pb, Mn and Fe in groundwater and surface runoff were identifying, which generate a significant contamination of soil and water; aspect very important if people in the region consume contaminated water from groundwater wells, that can cause harmful health effects.",
2389,"A novel irrigation canal scheduling approach without relying on a prespecified canal water demand process The creation of an efficient and environmentally friendly irrigation canal schedule strongly depends on the accuracy of the prespecifled water demand (PSWD) process in existing scheduling practices and modeling studies. Overestimating water demand would result in spillage losses from over-irrigation, while underestimating water demand would lead to crop yield losses due to deficit water supply. However, prespecifying an accurate water demand often poses various challenges for both farmers and canal administrators, as it involves the temporal variability in agrometeorological conditions, the spatial diversity of soil properties, and the sensitivity of crops to water stress at different growth stages. Therefore, to reduce the uncertainty of prespecifying water demand and avoid the adverse effects of an inaccurate water demand on canal water allocation, this paper proposes an alternative canal scheduling model that maximizes canal scheduling service quality by targeting the ultimate objectives of the irrigation system (UOIS) without considering the prespecifled water demand as the model input. The UOIS canal scheduling (UOIS-CS) model aims to optimize the canal water delivery schedule via simulation of soil water and salt migration using the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model, to provide the most suitable soil moisture content and soil salinity for crops. The UOIS-CS model is used for the Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, a typical agricultural watershed in China, where supplementary irrigation is performed after the autumn harvest (i.e., autumn irrigation) to leach excessive soil salt and preserve a moderate amount of soil moisture for the beginning of the next spring sowing period. To evaluate the irrigation performance of the UOIS-CS model further, a comparative analysis between the UOIS-CS model and the widely used PSWD-based canal scheduling (PSWD-CS) model is conducted. Compared with the PSWD-CS model, the proposed UOIS-CS model exhibits a superior irrigation performance in terms of leaching soil salt and preserving soil water, and a lower risk of canal overload operation during a higher water demand period. The improved performance of the UOIS-CS model is attributed to its greater adaptability to the spatial diversity of soil properties and the temporal variability in agrometeorological conditions, which originates from the full use of the equifinality of model performance metrics and model inputs. The UOIS-CS model provides managers with an effective approach to formulate a canal water delivery schedule with improved irrigation efficiency and lower overload risk. The proposed framework is generic and can be applied to non-crop growing seasons. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2390,"Development of a web-based global optimal management system for district cooling Development of a global optimal management system for district cooling is an arduous task due to the complicacy of district cooling. Traditionally the optimal management usually takes into account system's technical or economical performances only. This paper presents a web-based approach for this purpose, district cooling optimal management system, which considers not only technical and economical but also environmental and humanistic factors in the lifecycle of district cooling, and employs diverse measures such as artificial intelligence control, energy cost allocation and waste heat utilization, etc., in difference phases of the distract cooling system as designing, construction, commission and operation. After implemented in an actual engineering project in Shenzhen city, which is located in the southern of China, the district cooling optimal management system proposed in this paper is proven to be applicable and effective, and can achieve dual-goal of energy conservation and environmental protection successfully, which will lead to sustainable development. Additionally, in this engineering project, a green cooling water system, which employs fountain or artificial waterfall to instead of the cooling towers for minimizing the district cooling system's environmental impacts, is introduced too.",
2391,"Quality of Care Just after dawn, Vivej arrives at the hospital with her newborn under her arm to see you. She is 21 years old, two days postpartum, and exhausted after 36 hours of protracted labor. She is worried because she cannot get her firstborn, Esmile, to breastfeed. You learn that she delivered at a birthing clinic near her home and tells you that, even after her water broke, it took more than a day before the birth attendant could deliver her son. Your examination reveals a dire clinical picture: Esmile is lethargic and hypotonic, he has a poor suck reflex, his temperature is 39.8Â°C, his pulse is 180, and his breathing is labored. You check his white blood count, confirming leukocytosis. A spinal tap shows pleocytosis. You start him on fluids and antibiotics for neonatal sepsis with likely meningitis and quickly turn your attention to Vivej. Her situation is easier to diagnose but no less urgent: she is febrile and tachycardic, her blood pressure is 85/50. You give her fluids and start her on antibiotics. Ultimately, despite your efforts, both mother and child die. What went wrong? This chapter looks narrowly at these situationsâ€”the critical points after access and availability (including affordability) are already accomplished, when patients are in health care facilities that are staffed and equipped with appropriate technology. These are the situations in which the inputs are brought together and it is up to the provider to improve the health of the patient. Simply put, this chapter looks at the decisions and actions of the provider when seeing a patient. It is at this critical moment when we expect the doctor or nurse, or whoever is caring for the patient, to provide the best possible care by skillfully combining the available resources and technologies with the best clinical evidence and professional judgment. Esmile and Vivej received poor-quality care at the time of delivery. Several clinical steps were not taken. The prolonged rupture of membranes was not diagnosed in a timely manner. Vivej needed either to have her labor induced or, failing that, to be referred for a cesarean section. Prophylactic antibiotics should have been administered. Just as important, the provider at the birthing center needed support and professional oversight, with guidelines, supervision, or default referral systems in place to provide a path to the best care possible. The multiple failures in this case led to puerperal and neonatal sepsis. At worst, these conditions have a fatality rate greater than one in four; at best, they lead to protracted care, recovery, and clinical expense that could have been avoided. It is possible, however, to imagine providers in a different setting, with the same physical resources, giving better care and avoiding this tragic scenario. In the next section, we answer the questions raised in this scenario and in countless clinics and hospitals around the world. How much variation is there in the quality of care? How do we measure clinical practice? How and where has quality been systematically improved and practice variation reduced? What elements of care variation can be addressed by policy and what are the costs? Most important, what can be done to elevate the care given by providers in developing country settings? Our focus, therefore, is on the steps that can be taken to optimize the quality of care for patients like Esmile in pediatrics, Vivej in obstetrics, and other patients receiving care for the clinical conditions considered throughout the nine volumes of the third edition of Disease Control Priorities (DCP3).",
2392,"Isotopic study on the effect of reservoirs and drought on water cycle dynamics in the tropical Periyar basin draining the slopes of Western Ghats Apart from extreme hydrological events, such as, droughts and floods; large water bodies and land use patterns can significantly influence the water cycle dynamics in river basins. Assessment of cumulative effects of extreme events, water bodies and land use pattern on the hydrological cycle is not available in most parts of the world. Periyar river basin, draining the southern Western Ghats is recently been subjected to severe drought (2016) and devastating flood (2018); each leading to huge economic and ecological loss. This study uses stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) to understand the water cycle dynamics in Periyar river basin in relation to drought and reservoirs. The variable d-excess and lc-excess have been analyzed to understand the evaporative controls in determining the water cycle mechanism during drier seasons. The seasonality of isotopic imprints in different hydrologic compartments revealed higher variability in the rainwater during northeast monsoon (NEM) and pre-monsoon (PREM) owing to the presence of cyclonic circulations and evaporative fractionation. The higher rates of depletion in precipitation did not bring any subsequent depletion in the accumulated surface and groundwater rather it produces enrichments due to the evaporative loss of heavier isotopes owing to the drier weather conditions. The physiography of the basin has significantly influenced the distribution of delta H-2 and delta O-18 in the surface and groundwater indicating a higher rate of mixing in the middle stretch (midland) suggesting an altitudinal control in the basin. Shallow dug wells situated close to the reservoirs inherited the evaporation and isotopic signatures specific to the recharge source. The present study highlights the impact of drought on the water cycle dynamics of southwest India through increased evaporation signals (more negative lc-excess), reduced effects of elevation (altitude effect) and distance (continental effect) along the basin. The evaporation signals are more conspicuous over reservoirs and exhibit a significant role in recharging the shallow dug wells in their proximity. The lc-excess reveals that northeast side of the basin receives significant amount of recirculated moisture from the windward side of Western Ghats, as observed in an earlier study over the drier Tamil Nadu state. The present study thus underlines the effective use of stable isotopes in studying the impact of weather fluctuations (as extreme events) in the hydrological circulation which is not yet been utilized in many parts of the world.",
2393,"Content of toxic and essential metals in recrystallized and washed table salt in Shiraz, Iran BACKGROUND: Table salt is the most commonly used food additive. Since most of the salt consumed in Iran comes from mines, contamination with heavy metals is a health concern. The commonest salt purification method in Iran is washing with water. But recently, some industries have turned to recrystallization method. The present study aimed to determine the level of essential and non-essential heavy metals in the table salt refined with recrystallization and washing methods. METHODS: Thirty eight pre-packed salt samples were directly collected from retail market in Shiraz (22 samples refined with recrystallization method and 16 with washing method). The level of lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, nickel and cobalt was determined using Voltammetric method. Daily intakes of lead and cadmium as well as their weekly intakes were calculated. RESULTS: The levels of lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, nickel and cobalt in recrystallized samples were 0. 30 Â± 0.26, 0.02 Â± 0.02, 0.11 Â± 0.06, 0.34 Â± 0.22, 0.15 Â± 0.19 and 0.008 Â± 0.007 Î¼g/g, respectively, and also 0.37 Â± 0.27, 0.017 Â± 0.021, 0.19 Â± 0.18, 0.37 Â± 0.20, 0.13 Â± 0.23 and 0.037 Â± 0.06 Î¼g/g in washed salt samples. The calculated weekly intake of lead and cadmium was 0.216 and 0.014 Î¼g/kg, respectively for the recrystallized and 0.2653 and 0.0119 Î¼g/kg for the washed salts. CONCLUSION: All values for toxic metals were lower than the permitted maximum for human consumption as prescribed by Codex and Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran. Only 0.8652-1.0612% of lead and 0.17-0.2% of cadmium PTWIs are received via salt consumption weekly.",
2394,"Potential of Deficit and Supplemental Irrigation under Climate Variability in Northern Togo, West Africa In the context of a growing population in West Africa and frequent yield losses due to erratic rainfall, it is necessary to improve stability and productivity of agricultural production systems, e.g., by introducing and assessing the potential of alternative irrigation strategies which may be applicable in this region. For this purpose, five irrigation management strategies, ranging from no irrigation (NI) to controlled deficit irrigation (CDI) and full irrigation (FI), were evaluated concerning their impact on the inter-seasonal variability of the expected yields and improvements of the yield potential. The study was conducted on a maize crop (Zea mays L.) at a representative site in northern Togo with a hot semi-arid climate and pronounced dry and wet rainfall seasons. The OCCASION (Optimal Climate Change Adaption Strategies in Irrigation) framework was adapted and applied. It consists of: (i) a weather generator for simulating long climate time series; (ii) the AquaCrop model, which was used to simulate the irrigation system during the growing season and the yield response of maize to the considered irrigation management strategies; and (iii) a problem-specific algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply. We found high variability in rainfall during the wet season which leads to considerable variability in the expected yield for rainfed conditions (NI). This variability was significantly reduced when supplemental irrigation management strategies (CDI or FI) requiring a reasonably low water demand of about 150 mm were introduced. For the dry season, it was shown that both irrigation management strategies (CDI and FI) would increase yield potential for the local variety TZEE-W up to 4.84 Mg/ha and decrease the variability of the expected yield at the same time. However, even with CDI management, more than 400 mm of water is required if irrigation would be introduced during the dry season in northern Togo. Substantial rainwater harvesting and irrigation infrastructures would be needed to achieve that.",
2395,"Response of soil chemical properties to irrigation with winery wastewater on a well-drained sandy soil Most wineries in South Africa dispose of their wastewater through land application. This is carried out by irrigating small areas of cultivated pasture with the wastewater or ponding, with the former being the more general practice. Land application of winery wastewater results in the accumulation of potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) in the soil and leaching of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+).This could lead to long term instability of soil structure. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of irrigation with winery wastewater on chemical soil properties and potential environmental impacts. Therefore, an existing grazing paddock at a winery near Rawsonville was selected where wastewater had been applied for many years. Due to the high volumes of wastewater irrigation plus rainfall, the inevitable over-irrigation leached large amounts of cations, particular K+ and Na+, beyond 90 cm soil depth at the selected study site. These leached elements are likely to end up in natural water resources in the long run. Irrigation with winery wastewater did not have a pronounced effect on soil pH(KCl). This was probably due to the decomposition of organic matter, and the fact that the applied salts were leached beyond 90 cm depth. The study confirmed that disposal of winery wastewater through land application can only be recommended where wastewater application will not exceed the water requirement of the crop as well as the water holding capacity of the soil which is being irrigated.

2396,"Structural equation modeling of the interactions between trace elements and soil organic matter in semiarid soils The bioavailability of trace elements is strongly influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the soil system. This study sought to establish the relationships between the trace elements (barium, strontium and rubidium), soil organic matter and soil separates in semiarid soils from Central Botswana in a bid to improve our understanding of trace elements biogeochemistry. Trace element contents were obtained using portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, while routine soil analysis methods were used for soil organic matter analyses and particle size distribution. Both multivariate statistical analysis and structural equation model were applied to the data. Results for correlation matrix and principal component analysis showed trace elements affinity for silt, clay and soil organic matter: barium and silt (r = 0.54, p < 0.01), rubidium with clay (r = 0.69, p < 0.001) as well as strontium with stronger affinity for clay (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) and soil organic matter (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Principal component analysis showed that trace elements interactions with silt, clay and soil organic matter were observed more in profiles 3 and 7. Three structural equation models were obtained and in two of them, soil organic matter showed statistically highly significant direct effect on strontium which is further supported by all the multivariate statistical analysis results. Further research may be necessary to understand detailed aspects (e.g., complexations) between strontium and soil organic matter in semiarid soils.",
2397,"Arsenic risk mapping in Bangladesh: a simulation technique of cokriging estimation from regional count data Risk analysis with spatial interpolation methods from a regional database on to a continuous surface is of contemporary interest. Groundwater arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh and its impact on human health has been one of the ""biggest environmental health disasters"" in current years. It is ironic that so many tubewells have been installed in recent times for pathogen-free drinking water but the water pumped is often contaminated with toxic levels of arsenic. This paper seeks to analyse the spatial pattern of arsenic risk by mapping composite ""problem regions"" in southwest Bangladesh. It also examines the cokriging interpolation method in analysing the suitability of isopleth maps for different risk areas. GIS-based data processing and spatial analysis were used for this research, along with state-of-the-art decision-making techniques. Apart from the GIS-based buffering and overlay mapping operations, a cokriging interpolation method was adopted because of its exact interpolation capacity. The paper presents an interpolation of regional estimates of arsenic data for spatial risk mapping that overcomes the areal bias problem for administrative boundaries. Moreover, the functionality of the cokriging method demonstrates the suitability of isopleth maps that are easy to read.",
2398,"Variation of stream metabolism along a tropical environmental gradient Stream metabolism is affected by both natural and human-induced processes. While metabolism has multiple implications for ecological processes. relatively little is known about how metabolic rates are influenced by land use in tropical streams. ha this study, e assessed the metabolic characteristics and related environmental factors of six streams located in a transition area from Cerrado to Atlantic Forest (Sao Carlos/Brazil). Three streams were relatively preserved, while three were flowing through more agriculturally and/or urban impacted watersheds. Surf water samples were analyzed for biological and physico-chemical parameters as well as discharge and percentage of canopy cover. Metabolism was determined through the single-station method to estimate gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (FR) and net ecosystem production (NEP) with BAyesian Single-station Estimation (BASE). Nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in impacted versus preserved streams (e.g., average total phosphorus between 0.0280.042 mg L-1 and 0.009-0.038 mg L-1, respectively). Average canopy cover varied between 58 and 77%, with no significant spatial or seasonal variation. All streams were net heterotrophic (ER exceeded GPP) in all sampling periods. GPP rates were always lower an 0.7 gO(2) m(-2) d(-1) in all streams and ER varied from 0.6 to 42.1 gO(2) m(-2) d(-1). Linear Mixed-Effect models showed that depth, discharge. velocity and total phosphorus are the most important predictors for GPP. For ER, depth, velocity and canopy cover are significant potential predictors. Canopy cover was the main light limiting factor and influenced stream metabolism. Our findings reinforced the concepts that shifts in the shading effect provided by vegetation (e.g., through deforestation) or changes in discharge (e.g., through land use conversion or water abstractions) can impact freshwater metabolism. Our study suggests that human activities in low latitude areas can alter tropical streams' water quality. ecosystem function, and the degree of riparian influence. Our data showed that tropical streams can he especially responsive to increases of organic matter inputs leading to high respiration rates and t heterotrophy, and this should be considered to support management and restoration efforts.",
2399,"White Teeth and Healthy Skeletons for All: The Path to Universal Fluoride-Free Drinking Water in Tanzania Fluorosis has been prevalent in the great East African Rift Valley (EARV) since before this region was given a name. In the Tanganyika days, Germans reported elevated fluoride concentrations in natural waters. In the 1930s, the clear relationship between high fluoride level and mottling of teeth was established. Since then, the global research community has engaged in the battle to provide fluoride-free drinking water, and the battle is not yet won for low-income communities. An applicable concept for fluoride-free drinking water in the EARV was recently presented, using the Kilimanjaro as a rainwater harvesting park. The Kilimanjaro concept implies that rainwater is harvested, stored on the Kilimanjaro mountains, gravity-transported to the point of use, eventually blended with natural water and treated for distribution. This article provides a roadmap for the implementation of the Kilimanjaro concept in Tanzania. Specifically, the current paper addresses the following: (i) presents updated nationwide information on fluoride contaminated areas, (ii) discusses the quality and quantity of rainwater, and current rainwater harvesting practices in Tanzania, (iii) highlights how low-cost water filters based on Fe-0/biochar can be integrating into rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems to provide clean drinking water, and (iv) discusses the need for strict regulation of RWH practices to optimize water collection and storage, while simplifying the water treatment chain, and recommends strict analytical monitoring of water quality and public education to sustain public health in the EARV. In summary, it is demonstrated that, by combining rainwater harvesting and low-cots water treatment methods, the Kilimanjaro concept has the potential to provide clean drinking water, and overcome fluorosis on a long-term basis. However, a detailed design process is required to determine: (i) institutional roles, and community contributions and participation, (ii) optimal location and sizing of conveyance and storage facilities to avoid excessive pumping costs, and (iii) project funding mechanisms, including prospects for government subsidy. By drawing attention to the Kilimanjaro concept, the article calls for African engineers and scientists to take the lead in translating this concept into reality for the benefit of public health, while simultaneously increasing their self-confidence to address other developmental challenges pervasive in Africa.",
2400,"Fermented whey as natural descaling agent: Electrochemical and microscopical analysis Tap water in Kazakhstan is rich in carbonate due to contamination of surface water and insufficient drinking water treatment. This leads to scaling in home appliances such as cooking ware. Fermented whey is a by-product of small-scale farming, and is rich in lactic acid, with a pH similar to 2.8. Thus, it can be used to formulate a low-cost, environmentally friendly descaling agent. In this work, mild steel coupons were scaled through carbonate precipitation in boiling water. Scale removal with immersion in fermented whey, DI water, and food-grade vinegar was then carried out and monitored through electrochemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). While both fermented whey and vinegar removed the fouling layer, they caused pitting corrosion after prolonged immersion. The corrosion potential and current for mild steel coupons in 0.1 M KCl changed from -360 +/- 26 mV and 49.3 +/- 11.8 mu A to -652 +/- 1 mV and 16.2 +/- 3.8 mu A, upon scaling, indicating partial protection from corrosion and the formation of a non-conductive carbonate layer. Following treatment with fermented whey for 3 h, the corrosion potential increased to -427 +/- 11 mV, indicating a significant removal of the scale layer comparable to that obtained with commercial vinegar. However, the corrosion current increased only slightly to 24.7 +/- 6.2 mu A, indicating that the fermented whey treatment did not cause rapid corrosion of the coupons. SEM images confirmed the removal of scale layer upon treatment with fermented whey, relative to the control coupons treated with DI water. These results show that fermented whey can be used as environmentally friendly descaling agent. However, prolonged treatment with whey causes damages to the steel surface and a corrosion inhibitor must be included in the formulation. The availability of whey in small farming communities, in addition to the simple and low-cost methodology outlined here, show promises for practical application and adoption of this green technology in rural areas.

2401,"Field monitoring of a LID-BMP treatment train system in China In order to assess the urban runoff control effectiveness of a low-impact development best management practice (LID-BMP) treatment train system, a field test of selected LID-BMPs was conducted in China. The LID-BMPs selected include three grassed swales, a buffer strip, a bioretention cell, two infiltration pits, and a constructed wetland. The test site is in a campus in southern China. The LID-BMPs, connected in a series, received stormwater runoff from four tennis courts with an area of 2808 m(2) and eight basketball courts with an area of 4864 m(2). Construction of the LID-BMPs was completed in early spring of 2012, and the sampling was conducted during May of 2012 to September of 2013. During the sampling effort, besides the performance evaluations of grassed swales and the bioretention cell in controlling runoff quantity as well as quality, the emphasis was also on determining the performance of the LID-BMP treatment train system. A total of 19 storm events were monitored, with nine producing no runoff and ten producing runoff. Data collected from the ten storm events were analyzed for estimating runoff quantity (peak flow rate and total runoff volume) and quality reduction by the LID-BMPs. The sum of loads (SOL) method was used for calculating the water quality performance of LID-BMPs. Results indicated that, for peak flow rate, a bioretention cell reduction of 50-84 % was obtained, and grassed swale reduction was 17-79 %, with a runoff volume reduction of 47-80 and 9-74 %, respectively. For water quality, the bioretention cell in general showed good removal for zinc (nearly 100 %), copper (69 %), NH3-N (ammonia nitrogen) (51 %), and total nitrogen (TN) (49 %); fair removal for chemical oxygen demand (COD) (18 %); and poor removal for total suspended solids (TSS) (-11 %) and total phosphorus (TP) (-21 %). And its performance effectiveness for pollutant removal increased in the second year after 1 year of stabilizing. When considering the aggregated effect of the LIDBMP treatment train system, it showed excellent removal for NH3-N (73%), TN (74%), and TP (95 %) and fair removal for COD (19 %) and TSS (35 %). The assessment results of the LID-BMP treatment train system provide valuable information on how to link the different types of LID-BMP facilities and maximize the integrated effectiveness on urban runoff control.",
2402,"THE SE(SUGARY ENHANCER) GENE ENHANCING THE SACCHAROSE CONTENT OF SWEET CORN Rhodes, a plant breeder at the University of Illinois took note in 1967 of line IL677a originating from crossing (Bolivia 1035 x IL44b) x IL442a. The line had high sugar content in its kernels, that feature was maintained, and was released for public use in 1970. It is the only mutant that combines in its kernel the high saccharose content characteristic of mutant sh2 with high, water-soluble polysaccharide (phytoglicogen) content characteristic of common sweet corn (su). The feature is determined by the uptil now unknown gene se (sugary enhancer, 1978), its complete effect is developed ia genotype su, but it may be proved also in the presence of Su. In case of a deficiency in the long arm of 4th cromosome, it appears also in form of hemizygote, and may be transferred in other strains, as well (the University of Illinois offered nomerous su se strains for public use). The IL677a (su se) is resistant to Fusarium moniliforme, but is susceptible to maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV). Its germination in cold is poor, but the genotype shows rather big variability and by selection it may reach the level of su genotypes. In breeding the detection of se gene causes difficulties. The used indicatives: increased sugar content, slow water loss, light kernel colour (caused by lower pigment content), smaller kernels, high maltose content of ripen kernels. Unfortunately neither method is a perfect one, so further investigations are needed. Testing the maltose content of the ripen kernels seemes to be the best method, but the difference between Se Se Se and Se Se se kernels is very small and not reliable, also the genotypes Se se se and se se se stand near to each other, however the difference is bigger. A recent proposed method is to germinate the kernels at 25-degrees-C or 30-degrees-C for 4 or 3 days, then to take samples from the endosperm of the individual kernels without damaging the germs, to determine the maltose (and total sugar) content, to grow plants from the right kernels. Unfortunately such tests need adequate equipments and a good solution would be the infiltration of an appropriate indicator gene.",
2403,"Water quality and non-point sources of risk: the Jiulong River Watershed, P. R. of China Retrospective water quality assessment plays an essential role in identifying trends and causal associations between exposures and risks, thus it can be a guide for water resources management. We have developed empirical relationships between several time-varying social and economic factors of economic development, water quality variables such as nitrate-nitrogen, COD(Mn), BOD(5), and DO, in the Jiulong River Watershed and its main tributary, the West River. Our analyses used alternative statistical methods to reduce the dimensionality of the analysis first and then strengthen the study's causal associations. The statistical methods included: factor analysis (FA), trend analysis, Monte Carlo/bootstrap simulations, robust regressions and a coupled equations model, integrated into a framework that allows an investigation and resolution of the issues that may affect the estimated results. After resolving these, we found that the concentrations of nitrogen compounds increased over time in the West River region, and that fertilizer used in agricultural fruit crops was the main risk with regard to nitrogen pollution. The relationships we developed can identify hazards and explain the impact of sources of different types of pollution, such as urbanization, and agriculture.",
2404,"An extensive burden of giardiasis associated with intestinal schistosomiasis and anaemia in school children on the shoreline of Lake Albert, Uganda Background: Water-borne parasitic diseases associated with poverty still blight the lives of African school children. In Uganda, intestinal schistosomiasis is still common along the shoreline of Lake Albert, despite ongoing control, and co-infection with giardiasis and malaria is poorly described. To shed light on putative interactions between diseases, a prospective cross-sectional parasitological survey was undertaken in five primary schools. Methods: Stool samples from 254 school children, aged 5-10 years, were examined by microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), with additional real-time PCR assays for detection of Giardia DNA. A finger-prick blood sample was also taken from each child and tested for malaria, and haemoblobin levels measured. Assocations between diseases and anaemia were assessed. Results: Intestinal schistosomiasis (46.5%), giardiasis (41.6%) and malaria (56.2%) were common, and a quarter of children were anaemic (<115 g/L). Up to 87.0% of children were excreting Giardia DNA and the prevalence of heavy infection by real-time PCR (Ct <= 19) was 19.5%, being positively associated with light, moderate and heavy egg-patent schistosomiasis, as well as with anaemia. Conclusions: In this setting, an extensive burden of giardiasis was revealed with heavy intensity infections associated with egg-patent intestinal schistosomiasis and anaemia. To improve child health, greater attention on giardiasis is needed along with exploring joined-up actions across diseases that promote better water hygiene and sanitation measures.",
2405,"Risk Assessment Based on Highway Hydrogen Chloride Gas Leakage Scenario Using GIS As the domestic chemical industry continues to develop, handling and transportation of chemicals increases every year. Road freight in Korea accounts for more than 90%, and most of the chemical transportation is done through roads. These chemical vehicles can lead to major accidents if accidents occur. Transportation vehicles are likely to cause water pollution and soil pollution, which are factors of environmental damage, as well as traffic accidents that are the primary damage. In this work, we write a scenario for hydrogen chloride gas leakage by setting Banpo IC and Seocho IC sections as research areas, and use the ALOHA program to measure the predicted distance and analyze the time when hydrogen chloride gas reached according to the distance. In addition, risk assessment using population density was carried out for areas of damage caused by time using GIS. This suggests the need for prevention and countermeasures in areas of damage.",
2406,"Investigation of meteorological extreme events over coastal regions of Iran In this study, in order to detect probable trends and effects of climatic extreme events of precipitation and temperature as well as maximum relative humidity, dew point temperature, sunshine hours, and wind speed, 12 stations on the northern and southern coastlines of Iran were investigated from 1977 to 2007. For this purpose, 27 indices of precipitation and temperature, which are specified by the Expert Team of the World Meteorological Organization and Climate Variability and Predictability, were calculated by using RClimDex software. The Mann-Kendall method was also used to detect possible trends in the data time series. The results indicate that temperature indices are absolutely consistent with warming. Warm nights, hot days, and hot day and night frequencies increased, while cold spell and cool day and night frequencies declined. The minimum temperature experienced a considerable rise both in its maximum and minimum values. The minimum temperature had a higher increase than the maximum temperature. Therefore, diurnal temperature ranges have experienced dramatic declines. In the northern coastal sites, hot day frequency and hottest day temperature showed higher magnitudes than those of the southern sites as a result of the significant increase in the maximum sunshine hours in northern stations. This enhancement led to a considerable increase in the maximum wind speed. Consequently, relative humidity declined in the northern sites. Precipitation indices indicate few significant trends over the studied period. Temporal precipitation distribution was different from station to station. Three precipitation patterns were detected at individual stations, although an overall regional rainfall pattern was not detectable. On the whole, the results of this study emphasize that the water resources in the studied area are going to become problematic.",
2407,"Evapotranspiration from the understory of a tropical dry deciduous forest in Cambodia The water balance of tropical dry deciduous forests is less well understood than some other forest ecosystems. To help close this knowledge gap, we separately measured the evapotranspiration from the whole ecosystem (ETw), transpiration (TR) and interception loss (IL) from overstory trees, and evapotranspiration from the understory vegetation (ETU) in a tropical dry deciduous forest in Cambodia. It was found that ETw was equivalent to 73.7% of rainfall (P) at the annual scale. In the dry season, ET(w )corresponded to 120.1% of P, which indicates the utilization of soil water replenished during the wet season. The sum of transpiration estimated by the thermal dissipation (TD) method with the original coefficient (TRG), IL, and ETU was smaller than ETw, except for the middle of the dry season, due to an underestimation of TRG. Although recently reported calibration coefficients can reasonably correct TRG, future calibrations of the TD method are highly recommended for the precise evaluation of single-tree-scale transpiration in tropical dry forests. The annual contribution of the understory vegetation to ETw (ETU/ETw) was 34.6%, leading to the conclusion that the understory vegetation cannot be ignored when trying to gain a comprehensive understanding of the hydrologic cycle in tropical dry forests. The seasonal variations in ETU/ETw were mainly controlled by the leaf area index (LAI) of overstory trees, resulting from the overall stability of ETw and decreasing trend of ETU with increasing LAI in the wet season, with the opposite holding true in the dry season, i.e., decreasing ET w with the decline of LAI and less variations of ETU. Thus, LAI influenced both the seasonality and the annual contribution in ETU/ETw, exerting a notable influence on hydrological cycling in this forest.",
2408,"Integrating an artificial intelligence approach with k-means clustering to model groundwater salinity: the case of Gaza coastal aquifer (Palestine) Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have increasingly become efficient alternative modeling tools in the water resources field, particularly when the modeled process is influenced by complex and interrelated variables. In this study, two AI techniques-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machine (SVM)-were employed to achieve deeper understanding of the salinization process (represented by chloride concentration) in complex coastal aquifers influenced by various salinity sources. Both models were trained using 11 years of groundwater quality data from 22 municipal wells in Khan Younis Governorate, Gaza, Palestine. Both techniques showed satisfactory prediction performance, where the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) for the test data set were, respectively, about 4.5 and 99.8% for the ANNs model, and 4.6 and 99.7% for SVM model. The performances of the developed models were further noticeably improved through preprocessing the wells data set using a k-means clustering method, then conducting AI techniques separately for each cluster. The developed models with clustered data were associated with higher performance, easiness and simplicity. They can be employed as an analytical tool to investigate the influence of input variables on coastal aquifer salinity, which is of great importance for understanding salinization processes, leading to more effective water-resources-related planning and decision making.",
2409,"Structure and dynamics of water in TiO2 nano slits: The influence of interfacial interactions and pore sizes The interaction of water with TiO2 surfaces is of enduring interest because of wide applications of the TiO2 materials in aqueous environments. The structure and dynamic properties of water molecules in TiO2 nanopores are crucial as increasingly TiO2 materials are synthesized into nanoporous structures. In this work, the structural and dynamic properties of water molecules in nanoscale slit pores of TiO2 are investigated, by using three sets of force field models for the water-TiO2 interaction, as well as four TiO2 slit pore widths. It is concluded that the water- TiO2 interaction dominates the interfacial structure of water molecules, while the dynamic properties of water molecules are primarily influenced by the slit width in both interfacial and central regions. These findings indicate that both of the fluid properties and the interactions of fluids with pore wall will determine the transport properties of fluid in nanopores. If the pore size is large enough, e.g. 1.0 nm or larger in this work, the transport properties will be determined most by the fluids themselves. For the cases of pores whose sizes are in the range of interfacial region, the influences of pore size and interfacial interaction will interfere each other.

2410,"A sustainable approach to fabricate new 1D and 2D nanomaterials from natural abundant palygorskite clay for antibacterial and adsorption It is always highly desirable to synthesize functional nanomaterials using cheap, naturally abundant clay deposits as starting materials, but the major challenge is lack of new way to utilize all of components in clay deposits and minimize the generation of waste. In order to resolve the problem, we proposed a ""split"" and ""reconstruct"" strategy to tailor palygorskite (Pal) clay deposits, and used each component to synthesizing three new nanomaterials with different morphologies and functions: copper silicate nanotube (CuSiO3), silica nanotube@Cu nanoparticles (SiO2-NT@Cu), and Mg-Al-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The Pal clay deposits were first subjected to an acid bleaching process to obtain silica nanorods and solution rich in Mg(II), Al(II), Fe(III) ions. The silica as a Si source may react with Cu(II) to form CuSiO3 nanotube, which was allowed to be in-situ reduced in vapor or liquid phase to produce coral-like SiO2-NT@Cu nanocomposite with well-distributed Cu nanoparticles (CuNPs). The solution rich in Mg(II), Al(II), Fe(III) was used to synthesize Mg-Al-Fe LDH nanosheets by a simple co-precipitation process. It was confirmed that the tubular SiO2-NT@Cu nanocomposite can inhibit effectively the growth of E. coli and S. aureus, with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2.0 mg/mL and 0.6 mg/mL, respectively. The 2D nanolayered LDH compounds can capture efficiently and selectively anionic dye Congo Red (CR) with a maximum adsorption capacity of 254.14 +/- 7.72 mg/g, due to an ion exchange and electrostatic attraction mechanism. This work provides a universal, cost-efficient and sustainable way to utilize all of components in low-grade natural clay deposits to synthesize useful nanomaterials with special functions, and also opens a new avenue for high-value utilization of abundant clay deposits.",

2412,"The Influence of Large Scale Phosphate Mining on the Water Quality of the Huangbaihe River Basin in China: Dominant Pollutants and Spatial Distributions Large scale phosphate mining in the Huangbaihe River Basin, China has reduced the self-purification capacity of the basin's fresh water. Three years (2014-2016) of monitoring data and chemometric analysis were used to identify the dominant pollutants and define their spatial distribution in the basin. Principal component analysis was applied to determine the contribution of the individual pollutants. Total phosphorus (TP) 53%, water temperature (TEMP) 27%, and total nitrogen (TN) 20% proved to be the dominant problems. A discriminant functions (DF) model was developed to classify the study area into high, moderate, and low pollution zones. The DF coefficients were applied to analyze the correlation between DF and the measured parameters and it was found that TP, TN, and TEMP were positively correlated with the DF, indicating that these parameters were the most important. Finally, the results were compared with the locations of the mining activities, which revealed that TP is higher in the upper sub-basins, Xuanmiaoguan and Tianfumiao, where most of the high pollution zones are located and more than 78% of the areas are affected by the phosphate mines. It is concluded that the phosphate mining is the major source of pollution and TP is the dominant pollutant responsible for the total water quality variation in the river basin. More effective management measures have to betaken to reduce phosphorus runoff into the reservoir watersheds.

2413,"Urinary arsenic levels influenced by abandoned mine tailings in the Southernmost Baja California Peninsula, Mexico Gold has been mined at San Antonio-El Triunfo, (Baja California Sur, Mexico) since the 18th century. This area has approximately 5,700 inhabitants living in the San Juan de Los Planes and El Carrizal hydrographic basins, close to more than 100 abandoned mining sites containing tailings contaminated with potentially toxic elements such as arsenic. To evaluate the arsenic exposure of humans living in the surrounding areas, urinary arsenic species, such as inorganic arsenic (iAs) and the metabolites mono-methylated (MMA) and di-methylated arsenic acids (DMA), were evaluated in 275 residents (18-84 years of age). Arsenic species in urine were analyzed by hydride generation-cryotrapping-atomic absorption spectrometry, which excludes the non-toxic forms of arsenic such as those found in seafood. Urinary samples contained a total arsenic concentration (sum of arsenical species) which ranged from 1.3 to 398.7 ng mL(-1), indicating 33 % of the inhabitants exceeded the biological exposition index (BEI = 35 ng mL(-1)), the permissible limit for occupational exposure. The mean relative urinary arsenic species were 9, 11 and 80 % for iAs, MMA and DMA, respectively, in the Los Planes basin, and 17, 10 and 73 %, respectively, in the El Carrizal basin. These data indicated that environmental intervention is required to address potential health issues in this area.",
2414,"Assessment of potential, cost, and environmental benefits of CCS-EWR technology for coal-fired power plants in Yellow River Basin of China As an effective emission reduction approach, CO(2) capture and storage (CCS) combined with enhanced water recovery (EWR) technology can not only reduce CO(2) emissions, but can also recover deep saline water resources to relieve pressure on regional water resources, and can ensure the energy supply and both social and economic development. However, the environmental benefits and application costs of CCS-EWR are uncertain, and are determined by the technology level, geological conditions, and other physical factors. In this study, an optimal source-sink matching model and a techno-economic assessment model were developed to evaluate the contributions of CCS-EWR to carbon emission reduction and the increase of the water supply by considering various uncertain factors, as well as the corresponding costs. In addition, the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China was selected as the research region because, while there are abundant coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in the YRB, the water resources are scarce. The results revealed the following. (1) The maximum CO(2) capture capacity of the 236 CFPPs in the YRB is about 738.77 Mt/a, and nearly 13.14Â Gt of fresh water could be provided until the 236 CFPPs in the YRB retire, which can partially relieve the pressure on the supply of water resources. (2) With the consideration of the CCS-EWR benefits, the average cost of the 236 CFPPs in the YRB in their residual lifetime to reduce their CO(2) emissions by 90% will be no more than 180 CNY/t. (3) The incentive effect of the increase of the industrial water price on the profits of CCS-EWR projects is not significant. CCS-EWR technology has better application prospects in China under the dual constraints of carbon-neutral targets and water shortages, and more policy support is required for its deployment.",
2415,"Numerical modeling of the effects of pumping on tide-induced groundwater level fluctuation and on the accuracy of the aquifer's hydraulic parameters estimated via tidal method: a case study in Donghai Island, China Coastal groundwater level is affected both by tide and pumping. This paper presents a numerical model to study the effects of pumping on tide-induced groundwater level fluctuation and on accuracy of hydraulic parameters estimated via tidal method. Firstly, for the effects of pumping on the groundwater level fluctuation under the combined influence of pumping and tide, groundwater level has a drawdown but eventually reaches a quasi-steady-state again. Steady pumping can attenuate the amplitude but cannot affect the phase of the quasi-steady fluctuation. However, seaward steady pumping plays a relatively obvious role in enhancing drawdown compared with landward pumping, a partial penetration well leads to greater drawdown than a full penetration well, and transient pumping induces large amplitude which does not reflect large transmissivity. Secondly, for the effects of pumping on the accuracy of the parameter estimated via the tidal method, transient pumping or large steady pumping, especially in a full penetration well, significantly affects accuracy of the estimated parameters. However, when the distance between the pumping well and tide observation well exceeds 200% of the distance between observation well and shoreline, pumping effect on estimated parameters can be neglected. The conclusions could provide guidance for reasonable application of the tidal method.",
2416,"Exploring the criteria influencing construction productivity of diaphragm walls in underground stations in Egypt Planning and cost estimation engineers face great challenges to estimate construction productivity rate (PR) of diaphragm walls (DWs). A specific guideline to predict the construction of DWs in underground station is still not available. In order to overcome these challenges, the criteria affecting PR for the construction of DWs should be hence defined and the factors that impact the construction productivity of DWs should be well understood. Briefly and given the limitations of previous research work, we gathered and compiled a comprehensive key list of all criteria based on previous reports. This comprehensive key list was later reviewed by underground construction and specialized experts to define, identify and distinguish the most important criterion affecting the construction productivity of DWs in Egypt. We developed two questionnaire surveys to conduct these interviews with the experts. This obtained criterion was ranked and weighted using Simos' procedure based on prioritizing the influencing criteria. Our findings concluded that the ground condition type/and characteristics, soil-machine interaction, machine type and model characteristics (grab/or cutter), breakdowns and de-sender efficiency are significantly influencing the excavation rate. Additionally, factors such as cage type (fiber/or steel), connection type (welding/or mechanical) and volume of steel fixing crew are crucial to identify the rate of installation cages. On the other side, the arrival time of concrete car mixer and panel volume were determined to significantly impact the concrete casting rate. In summary, this study presented a distinctive weighting and ranking methodology of the influencing criteria for the PR of DWs. Furthermore, this work provides an initial concept for many full-scale prediction applications to estimate an accurate construction productivity of DWs, particularly in the underground projects.",
2417,"[Environment, health and sustainable development] Environmental problems and their impact on health and welfare of the population, mainly the most deprived and excluded, from access to material and symbolic goods, provided only to a privileged minority, must be analyzed within the context of the global economic and financial crisis which swept the whole world since 2008. The collapse of the capitalist system and its negative impacts on production, income and employment provide evidence to the predatory nature of the underlying social and political relations which lead humanity to a catastrophic abyss whose consequences are felt on local, national and global levels. Appointing to the main aspects of environmental deterioration - greenhouse gases; pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans; the erosion and intoxication of soils; the lack of basic sanitation and fresh water supply in metropolitan areas, this essay refers to official health indicators published recently by the Ministry of Health of Brazil which documents destructive trends. Discussing the dysfunction and the paradoxes of capital accumulation the essay points out to the need for building a new development paradigm based on cooperation and solidarity; an equitable distribution of the social product and the reform of the political system leading from the present authoritarian patterns of social relations to a participative and a true democratic model.",
2418,"The Politics of Difference and the Forging of a Political 'Community': Discourses and Practices of the Charterist Civic Movement in the Vaal Triangle, South Africa, 1980-84 The period 1984-86 has been widely recognised as a watershed in South Africa's history, leading to the most sustained challenge to the apartheid regime and eventually contributing to the demise of white minority rule. The Vaal Uprising of September 1984, triggered by dissatisfaction over rent increases and an illegitimate and defunct local government, heralded the beginning of the insurrectionary period. However, while the uprisings of the mid 1980s have attracted sustained scholarly interest, the processes that underwrote the rebellious momentum and the discourses and practices shaping civic politics warrant greater attention. Based on a large body of archival material and life history interviews, this article examines the roots of the emerging Charterist civic movement in the Vaal Triangle. It seeks to show that civic politics emerged along multiple fault lines, which reflected complex processes of inclusion and exclusion. Antagonism towards community councillors increased in the years before the uprising, and led to the defining of collective identities and the forging of a political community' that excluded them. These processes of inclusion and exclusion reflected not only contestations over the political order but multiple cleavages rooted in a failure on the part of councillors to honour the social contract. With the formation of underground units of the African National Congress in 1982 and the establishment of the Vaal Civic Association in 1983, localised processes of conflict and discourses of contestation began to intersect with anti-apartheid politics. The article argues that these layers of contestation finally led to a politics of difference that provided the matrix for rebellion.",
2419,"NUTRIENT AND WATER MANAGEMENT EFFECTS ON CROP PRODUCTION, AND NUTRIENT AND WATER USE EFFICIENCY IN DRYLAND AREAS OF CHINA Located in the northern territory of China, the vast semiarid and subhumid regions referred to as dryland areas are stressed by two major constraints for crop production: shortage of water supply and deficiency of nutrients in soil. Low precipitation and its uneven distribution have resulted in soil water, surface water and groundwater deficit, and made crops being under water stress in most cases. As a direct result, except for a few places that can conduct irrigation, most regions remain rainfed agriculture. In addition to shortage of water supply, serious wind and water erosion derived from sparse vegetation coverage, windy climate and frequent rainstorms plus human activities have led to serious soil degradation and nutrient stress. Deficiency of N can be found everywhere and that of P occurs at least in one third of the arable lands, this leading to low productivity. However, the limited water resources have not been fully used and the nutrient use efficiency by crops is very low, both having a certain potential for use and a large room for improvement. Management of water and nutrients are extremely important not only for crop production, but for environmental concern in these areas. Water and nutrients have great interactions that may gain either positive or negative effects on crop production, depending on crop growth stages, amounts, combinations and balance. In the dryland areas, the effect of nutrients and that of water are often limited to each other. Remarkable variations in precipitation from year to year significantly influence soil water and nutrient status, and so do the nutrient input effect. Nutrient input may obtain a good harvest in one year while a poor harvest in another. Considering the precipitation changes and taking effective measures to regulate nutrient supply, crops may not suffer from water limitation in a dry year and from nutrient deficiency in a wet year, and in this way we cannot lose the opportunity to obtain good harvest in both dry and wet year. Nutrient input is the key for crop production. Roots are essential for taking up water and nutrients to support crop growth, and the significance of roots becomes even more important on drylands, since the topsoil is often dry and nutrients are often unavailable, and plants need to extend their roots into deep layer to obtain available nutrients in the moist soil. It has been found that in most cases, crop yield is highly correlated with crop root mass almost in a linear shape. Addition of organic fertilizers can enhance soil organic matter, raise soil water storage capacity, reduce soil bulk density, and therefore create good conditions for root penetration into deep layer. Both organic and chemical fertilizer can provide nutrients for forming strong root system and for roots having a higher capacity to absorb nutrients and water, improve root activities such as raising the root synthetic ability of amino acids by rational N fertilization. Different nutrients have different functions on root growth and its distribution. Nutrient input is also essential for improvement of plant physiological activities. Regulating plant water status and osmotic pressure, increasing the activity of nitrate reductase in plant leaves and raising photosynthesis and transpiration intensity whereas decreasing evaporation constitute some important aspects. All these benefit plants in optimization of the use efficiency of water and nutrients. Experimental results show that the osmotic regulation effect is higher with fertilization. The increase of N-supply level reduces disorder of N metabolism in plants deficient in water and increases plant resistance to drought. Under water stress, rational N supply could make wheat leaves to have high activity of nitrate reductase, high levels of proteins, and better water status. Bleeding sap amount increase per plant by N fertilization provides evidence that water intake by plants is increased. Addition of K can make leaf stomata quickly closed under dry and hot wind conditions. With normal water supply, transpiration rat is increased by fertilization while reduced in a water deficit case. Due to vigorous growth, rapid leaf emergency, large leaf area and high coverage rate of plants on the ground with fertilization, soil surface evaporation is reduced and more water is used by transpiration. It has been found that by rational N fertilization, the ratio of water lost by transpiration to that by evapotranspiration was increased from 0.32 to 0.65, and water loss by evaporation was decreased by 1/3, the water use efficiency (WUE) for both grain and dry matter production being increased. Addition of nutrients, particularly K, can increase chlorophyll, protect the photosynthetic organs from dryness and make the photosynthetic organs fully played their role, and therefore increase the photosynthesis that is regarded as the main cause for crop yield reduction under dry conditions. All these have made the dryland crop production increased. Wise input of fertilizer and manure may do more to prevent soil erosion than some of the more obvious mechanical means of control, since the growing of bumper crops by fertilization not only gives a maximum ground cover but supplies sufficient organic matter to aid in the maintenance of all important soil constituents; and the increase of soil permeability to water under such conditions is certainly a factor of major importance. Effective water management can increase nutrient availability, transformation of nutrients in soil or from fertilizers. Mineralization of organic N is proportional to soil water, and the net mineralized nitrate-N is increased with the increase of water content in an adequate range under suitable temperature. A very closely linear relationship has been found between water content and mineralized N. Due mainly to good aeration induced by deficit of water on drylands, ammonium-N both from soil and fertilizers can be quickly nitrified into nitrate-N. Thus, a large amount of nitrate-N often accumulates in soil profile that has been used as a good index for reflecting soil N-supplying capacity. Adequate water content can promote nitrification of ammonium N while the process is inhibited when moisture content is too high or too low. Water influences mineral nutrient movement from soil to roots and then from roots to aboveground parts of plants. The difference of nitrate N concentrations at different distance points of soil from a plant being greatly declined by adequate irrigation is a typical example showing that some nutrients could be transferred as solute to plant roots with water movement. Adequate soil water content can significantly transfer a large portion of N to aboveground part, and increase N contents in seeds. All in all, water promotes total nutrient uptake by plants and nutrient use efficiency, and affects nutrient composition of plants. It has been reported that N recovery was increased about 20% at any N rate by an adequate supply of water. Water deficit, on the other hand, not only causes water stress to plants, inhibits plant root growth, reduces roots-absorbing area and capacity, increases the viscosity of sap in hadromestome, and thereby decreases nutrient transfer, but also reduces the availability of soil nutrients, nutrient movement in soil, and nutrient uptake and efficiency. Plant growth and crop yield are thus reduced. However, the reduction rate of plant growth is more serious than nutrient uptake, leading to a relative increase in nutrient concentration. Too much supply of water may cause nitrate N leaching and decrease N recovery. Since water supply and nutrient efficiency are closely related, balanced application of nutrients, and determination of their types, ratios, amounts, timing and methods should be based not only on the nutrient-supplying capacity, but also on water status of soil. Rational combinative supply of water and nutrients can increase efficiency of both and produce good interaction. When available water supply is less than a certain range, crops may have little response to fertilizers at any rate, and with sufficient supply of water, nutrient eff ciency is increased. An intense interaction exists between available water and fertilizer, and one being changed will likewise lead to the change of the other. The interaction of water and fertilizer is time dependant, and application of water and fertilizer at different stages of plant growth may produce different interaction effects. Oversupply of either or both may delay crop maturation by encouraging excessive vegetative growth, while deficit of water may result in high nutrient concentration in soil, making it difficult for crops to take up and use both water and nutrients, and in a worst case, plants may die resulting in ""haying off"" effect. The different results obtained for the optimal time of application of water and fertilizer may relate to soil water and nutrient supply at different time. For promotion of water and nutrient fully playing their role and realization of maximum yield, high quality and high efficiency, while protection of the environment from fertilizer ill impact, one important thing is to fully understand and utilize their positive interaction, and attention should be paid not only to input of water and nutrients, but to their rational combination. That is, for addition of water, one should consider nutrient supply, and for addition of nutrients, one should consider water coordination, so that limited nutrient and water can produce optimum effect. Short supply of fresh water and fertilizer pollution has promoted investigations into the interaction effects of water and nutrients on crop yield and nutrient efficiency and WUE, and some achievements have been made. However, there still exist a large number of issues that need further studies in the future. Delineating drylands into different regions and determining the priority issue in each region, determination of most efficient time or growth stage for input of nutrients and water to different crops, and interaction mechanism of water and nutrients are some important aspects.",
2420,"Landslide-driven drainage network evolution in a pre-steady-state mountain belt: Finisterre Mountains, Papua New Guinea The emergence of an orogen is generally characterized by an early phase of rapid surface uplift and the concomitant evolution of montane topography, leading in some cases to a steady state in which tectonic mass flux is balanced by erosion. This early phase of mountain growth is exemplified in the Finisterre Mountains of Papua New Guinea, a propagating growth fold whose catchments can be observed at a range of stages in their temporal evolution. Watersheds appear to initiate by isolated gorge incision, to expand by large-scale landsliding in a manner controlled by ground-water seepage, and to entrench by fluvial incision of landslide scars and deposits. Once a montane system of ridges and valleys is established, only rare, major landslides can modify the drainage pattern, The steady-state morphology of a mountain belt is therefore intimately related to its initial phase of growth.",
2421,"Climate change impoverishes and homogenizes ants' community structure: a long term study Climate change brings along trend-like changes as well as changes in the temporal variations in environmental conditions which interact with the biological dynamics of ecological systems. Therefore, only studies covering several decades may unveil long term trends in ecological systems, such as in animal communities. To demonstrate if recent climatic changes have caused fundamental changes in the structure of a key arthropod community, I studied the long-term dynamics of ant colonies for 37 years on a sandy grassland in central Hungary. To be able to monitor colonies - the natural units of ant communities - with the possible least disturbance, I applied two grids of a total of 80 slate plates as artificial nesting sites. Prior to the presented study, a well-defined spatial ant community structure had been identified in the studied habitat, which consisted of three species groups (dune top, transitional and dune slack groups), occupying different habitat patches. During the study period 2813 nests of 11 ant species were recorded under the slates. Over the 37 years, community pattern markedly changed, dune slack species disappeared from the studied plots, while the frequency of drought-tolerant dune top species increased by a significant trend. No significant trend was observed in the case of the transitional species group. On the species population level, two species, Lasius niger and Formica cunicularia, showed an intensive population decline; while the Plagiolepis taurica population significantly increased and spatially joined the transitional species group in the dune slack in the second half of the project. These changes led to a major decline in species richness and a homogenization of species composition across habitat patches. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that the depletion of groundwater had the strongest relationship with these population trends. The study indicates that climate change can be linked to a fundamental change in the community structure of major ecosystem actors.",
2422,"Using Statistical Analysis to Assess Urban Groundwater in Beni Mellal City (Morocco) The study was carried out in a shallow phreatic aquifer in the piedmont zone between the Atlas Mountains and Tadla plain in Morocco. This study is carried out using physicochemical analyses with statistical analysis (CA and PCA) to show variability of groundwater hydrochemical parameters beneath Beni Mellal city in order to know spatial variability of water quality under urban activities. Total dissolved solid shows large variation from 355mg/L to 918mg/L with high values recorded, as electric conductivity, in the city center. High sulfate content is intercepted also in the old city center with values exceeding the threshold in the Moroccan guideline. Sulfate ions are often suspected of having an anthropogenic origin. All water samples show a dominance of Ca against Mg (Ca/Mg: 1.08-6.25) and HCO3 against SO4 (HCO3/SO4: 0.29-6.92). For most of the trace elements, the measured concentrations were far below the standard values except Al and Fe in some samples which exceed all guideline values. PCA of all dataset highlights eight factors with eigenvalues higher than 1 that explained about 80.34% of the total variance. The first two components PC1 and PC2 explained about 41.14% of the total cumulative variance and were responsible for 24.25% and 16.89% of the variance for each one, respectively. The component PC1 is mostly correlated with electric conductivity, TDS, and chloride. The component PC2 was highly correlated with Ca, Cr, and Zn. The dendrogram at a linkage distance of about 10.5 leads to dividing the diagram into three clusters of water samples, C-1, C-2, and C-3. Cluster C-1 shows a medium content of EC, HCO3, and NO3 and low content of TDS, Ca, Mg, Na, K, SO4, and Ba compared with C-2 and C-3. C-1 samples show the lowest ion content, resulting probably from the minimal time of residence within the aquifer with low rock interactions. Cluster C-2 regroups samples with high content of Ca, Mg, K, SO4, Al, and Cr, medium content of TDS and Na, and low content of EC, HCO3, NO3, and Cl. Samples in cluster C-3 have more content of heavy metal (Cd, Fe, Mn, and Ni), CE, TDS, Ca, Mg, Na, HCO3, NO3, and Cl, with low content of Cr and Al and medium values of K and SO4. We recommended the monitoring and follow-up of the water quality under the city and the repair of pipes especially in the downtown area to limit unwanted infiltration. Spatial autocorrelation used with variograms and Moran'I leads to conclude that groundwater parameters varied differently according to the direction, which means that the semivariance depended on direction and distance between samples.",
2423,"Groundwater chemistry and mass transfers in the Independence aquifer, central Mexico, by using multivariate statistics and mass-balance models In the light of progressive depletion of groundwater reservoir and water quality deterioration of the Independence aquifer, an investigation on chemical data of dissolved major and minor constituents in 246 recent groundwater samples was performed. The main objective was the detection of processes responsible for the geochemical evolution and mineralization throughout the area. Multivariate techniques revealed different sources of solutes (a) dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonate minerals, (b) weathering of acid volcanic minerals, (c) alteration of manganese containing alkaline silicates, (d) leaching of halite deposits of meteoric origin, (e) contamination from agricultural and urban wastewaters, and (f) evaporative effects due to intensive irrigation. Although nitrate contamination is associated with pollution from intensive cultivated areas, natural contamination plays an important role in the study area. The investigation reveals that weathering of acid volcanic rocks (rhyolite) and oxidation of arsenic bearing sulfide minerals are the responsible processes for high fluorine (up to 16 mg/l) and arsenic (up to 0.12 mg/l) contents, respectively, exceeding the Mexican maximum admissible concentration for drinking water. Except for kaolinite, all recharge processes are dissolution oriented (CO2, calcite, dolomite, K-feldspar, plagioclase). Silicate precipitation (amorphous silica and chalcedony) is of growing importance in discharge zones. Cation exchange is not an important issue in the whole study area.",
2424,"Haemorrhagic diarrhoea and reproductive failure in Bonsmara cattle resulting from anomalous heavy metal concentrations in soils, forages and drinking water associated with geochemical anomalies of toxic elements on the farm Puntlyf, South Africa Poor livestock health conditions are associated with geochemical Pb anomalies on a farm approximately 40 km east of Pretoria, South Africa. A generic risk assessment of drinking water for Bonsmara cattle obtained from three separate subterranean water sources on the farm, revealed the presence of several potentially hazardous constituents suspected for the development of adverse health effects in the herd. The two main symptoms of the herd, namely, severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea in calves and reproductive failure in cows, have been investigated. A selenium-induced copper deficiency was proposed as the main cause to the calf diarrhoea, due to complexing, between high concentrations of Se, Mo, Hg and Pb in drinking water. It was also anticipated that such Cu deficiencies would lead to low systemic Se inducing hypothyroidism in the cows due to inadequate iodine activation required for thyroid hormone formation and consequently adversely affect reproduction. The anomalous Pb in borehole drinking water on the southern part of the farm, suggests a clear genetic link with the underlying geochemical Pb anomalies detected by means of an ongoing regional geochemical survey.",
2425,"Design and Construction of an Underground Concrete Barrage Drinking Water for Supply in Java This article gives an overview on the design and construction of a concrete barrage in a cave river which is part of an underground hydropower plant in a karst area in Java, Indonesia. To ensure the transferability of this German-Indonesian pilot project to other regions in Indonesia, only locally available building materials and technologies were to be used. Because of the extraordinary conditions of the underground construction site with year-round aquiferous river, poor accessibility and little working space, the technological options were furthermore restricted. Due to the implementation of exceptional technological solutions, the barrage could be finished despite earthquake and flood events and has proved its serviceability in first operational tests in summer 2008. Throughout the project a close co-operation with the Indonesian project partners was assured.",
2426,"Contents and Antioxidant Activities of Polysaccharides in 14 Wild Mushroom Species from the Forest of Northeastern China This study aimed to evaluate the polysaccharide contents and antioxidant activities of 14 important wild mushroom species in the Lesser Khingan Range Forest of northeastern China. The fungal species were identified by morphology and DNA matching, belonging to six families: Polyporaceae (four species), Tricholomataceae (three), Russulaceae (three), Lepiotaceae (two), Lycoperdaceae (one), and Paxillaceae (one). Polysaccharides were isolated and partially purified from the water extract of each m ushroom by ethanol precipitation, deproteinization, and dialysis. Antioxidant activities of the mushroom polysaccharides were found to vary with both the species and the assay methods, and the highest three were from Handkea utriformis (535.8 Î¼mol trolox/g), Macrolepiota mastoidea (378.6), and Armillaria ostoyae (329.1) in radical scavenging; H. utriformis (5.94 mmol Fe/g), Lepista nuda (4.65), and A. ostoyae (4.42) in reducing power; and Armillariela cepistipes (484.6 Î¼mol Fe2+/g), H. utriformis (274.8), and M. mastoidea (202.5) in Fe2+ chelating. Several of the polysaccharides showed notable anti-tyrosinase activities, and that of Chroogomphus rutilus was the most potent with an IC50 of 0.46 mg/ml. These wild mushrooms can be useful sources of polysaccharides as potential antioxidants and tyrosinase inhibitors. This is the first systematic study on the wild mushroom species, as well as their polysaccharide contents and biological activities, from this forest.",
2427,"Geoenvironmental controls on the formation of human urinary calculi: a case study from Jordan The purpose of this study is to determine the factors responsible for the prevalence of urinary stones disease among the inhabitants of selected regions in northern Jordan and to trace the extent of their link with the hydrogeochemical properties of groundwater in the area in addition to geoenvironmental factors and some certain dietary habits. By comparing the disease spread in the studied areas, results showed that the elevated areas (Irbid and Amman) are the most affected regions with the disease. One hundred and thirty water samples collected from 15 wells were distributed across the three studied regions to identify urinary stone patients among individuals. All samples were analyzed for percentages of cations and anions to assess water quality. Anions are distributed in the following order: HCO3- >Cl- >SO42- >NO3- >F- >PO43-, while the cations are distributed as follows: Ca2+ >Mg2+ >Na+ >K+ >Fe2+. The hydrogeochemical analysis results for the three regions compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The significant difference in the values of TDS, TH, Cl-, NO3-, Ca2+, and Mg2+ is p < 0.05 compared with water quality in the regions of Amman-Mafraq and Irbid-Mafraq. Depending on Gibbs' diagram and the factor analysis, elements ratio plots strongly suggest that the source of chemical ions in the groundwater is the interaction of water with carbonate rocks. Therefore, this study confirms the strong relationship between urinary stones formation and the geochemistry of drinking water during the high calcium content and increase of the water hardness used by the residents of the study areas. The effect of temperature on the formation of urinary stones was observed through the direct correlation with the amount of water consumed by individuals. In winter, the daily water intake decreases, which leads to an increase in the concentration of Ca, Na, and P ions in the bladder. The high temperature in the summer increases the dehydration process in the body, which increases the concentration of calcium and other ions to create an opportunity for urine stones to form.",
2428,"Nitrogen leaching losses following biogas slurry irrigation to purple soil of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area Ammonium (NH(4)(+)) in biogas slurries is readily nitrified into very mobile soil nitrate (NO(3)(-)) to promote nitrogen (N) leaching concerning which a few studies, however, have been reported. These slurries are regularly applied through irrigation to purple soil in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, and therefore we explored the consequent N leaching there with a plot experiment. Biogas slurry irrigation was carried out with nitrogen application rates of 0, 48, 144, 240, 336, and 480Â kgÂ N/ha. As a result, the last two rates have triggered N leaching being detrimental to groundwater safety. In addition, N leaching was negatively correlated with soil microbial biomass, diversity, and respiration, indicating a potential technique to prevent it with soil heterotrophs activated by increased ratios of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) in biogas slurries.",
2429,"A novel strategy to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling by rotating membrane module Integrated ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology has attracted extensive attention in drinking water treatment due to its excellent performance and small footprint. However, membrane modules normally are static in membrane tanks, which cause a gradual increase in the cake layer thickness over time, thus resulting in severe membrane fouling. To overcome this shortcoming, we report an effective strategy to regulate cake layer thickness by rotating the membrane module in the presence of flocs. The results showed that the cake layer thickness can be effectively reduced because of the floc looseness, resulting in the alleviation of membrane fouling. The higher the module rotation speed, the higher the flow velocity in the membrane tank and the larger the shearing force on the cake layer surface. As a result, the membrane fouling was considerably mitigated, and it was interesting that the pollutant removal efficiency was hardly influenced. With module rotation, we found that acid solutions displayed a better performance in removing pollutants (even low molecular weight pollutants) and alleviating membrane fouling compared to the alkaline conditions because of the smaller floc size, larger floc specific surface area, and higher floc positive charge. Additionally, an excellent UF membrane performance was also observed with the raw water taken from the South-North water in China. Collectively, this study demonstrated that floc-based cake layers can be effectively regulated with module rotation, which has a great potential in drinking water treatment application, particularly in small water plants.

2430,"The use of multivariate statistical methods for optimization of the surface water quality network monitoring in the Paraopeba river basin, Brazil This study sought to evaluate and propose adjustments to the water quality monitoring network of surface freshwaters in the Paraopeba river basin (Minas Gerais, Brazil), using multivariate statistical methods. A total of 13,560 valid data were analyzed for 19 water quality parameters at 30 monitoring sites, over a period of 5Â years (2008-2013). The cluster analysis grouped the monitoring sites in eight groups based on similarities of water quality characteristics. This analysis made it possible to detect the most relevant monitoring stations in the river basin. The principal components analysis associated with non-parametric tests and the analysis of violation of the standards prescribed by law, allowed for identifying the most relevant parameters which must be maintained in the network (thermotolerant coliforms, total manganese, and total phosphorus). The discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater, that from mining activities and diffuse pollution from agriculture and pasture areas are the main sources of pollution responsible for the surface water quality deterioration in this basin. The BP073 monitoring site presents the most degraded water quality in the Paropeba river basin. The monitoring sites BP094 and BP092 are located geographically close and they measure similar water quality, so a possible assessment of the need to maintain only one of the two in the monitoring network is suggested. Therefore, multivariate analyses were efficient to assess the adequacy of the water quality monitoring network of the Paraopeba river basin, and it can be used in other watersheds.",
2431,"Hydrogeochemistry of the Middle Rio Grande aquifer system - Fluid mixing and salinization of the Rio Grande due to fault inputs Deeply-derived fluids influence river and groundwater hydrochemistry at the Socorro ""constriction"" in the central New Mexico Rio Grande rift. New hydrochemical transects in the Rio Grande rift provide three-dimensional perspectives on sources contributing to surface and groundwaters. In addition to abrupt salinity increases in the Rio Grande, major and trace ion chemistry, delta O-18, delta D, delta C-13, Sr-87/Sr-86, H-3 and He-3/He-4 variations in springs and wells across the rift are best explained by mixing of deeply-derived endogenic fluids, containing both mantle and crustal inputs, with shallow groundwater. Endogenic fluids ascend along rift-bounding and intra-rift faults, and can cause increased salinity accompanied by an increase in metals and overall degradation of water quality. Our data reinforce models that attribute a downstream increase in salinity to geological, not agricultural, influences. Hydrochemical mixing of endogenic waters along faults in shallow aquifers has a major influence on groundwater and surface water quality and variability in arid tectonically active regions, with important ramifications for water management.

2432,"Shades of green energy: Geographies of small hydropower in Yunnan, China and the challenges of over-development Small hydropower (SHP) has a global reputation as a 'green', low-carbon energy source that improves rural livelihoods and contributes to local economic development. In China, SHP has grown rapidly since the early 2000s, particularly in the water-rich provinces in the country's southwest. However, because SHP plants in China are privately-operated and approved by local governments, there is an incentive to construct large, multiple cascade systems to generate as much power as possible. In many areas, this has led to over-development of SHP and associated negative environmental and social impacts. In this paper, we identify the factors that shape geographies of SHP over-development, what we refer to as 'shades' of green energy. We then analyze the direct and indirect impacts of over-development. We draw on interviews and electricity generation data from six prefectures in Yunnan province, one of the world's largest hydropower producing regions. We find that prefectures that operate in a semi-autonomous way in electricity management and industrial planning are most prone to over-develop SHP, since they depend on hydropower revenues from electricity generation and local energy-intensive industries. We also find that over-development of SHP causes streamflow reductions and unstable electricity generation, and in some areas, drives an increase in environmentally-destructive mineral processing and reduces irrigation water access. These findings suggest a need for coordinated river basin planning on small watersheds and a reassessment of the role of SHP in local economic development.",
2433,"Life cycle toxicity assessment on deep-brine well drilling The features of a life cycle toxicity assessment (LCTA) model include regionalization, uncertainties, and geographical variability. This study provides a simplified and regionalized LCTA to improve the evaluation of regional toxicity impact based on a case study of deep-brine well drilling in China. Uncertainty analysis was conducted using Taylor series expansions. The proposed LCTA can efficiently quantify the toxicity impact and identify its key contributing factors. Results show that the key factors contributing to the toxicity impact of deep-brine well drilling are steel, electricity, and direct pollutant emissions generated from fluid loss and waste (i.e., waste drilling fluid and drilling cuttings) disposal during drilling. The most significant substances are mercury and arsenic to water, copper and barium to soil, and vanadium to air. Selecting a drilling fluid with low heavy metals, decreasing the consumption of energy and raw materials, reducing the drilling fluid loss, and optimizing the waste disposal are effective approaches to reduce the overall toxicity impact of deep-brine well drilling.

2434,"The Examination of Afyonkarahisar's Geothermal System Corrosion Corrosion and scaling of metal surfaces are the major problems caused by geothermal fluids when metallic structures are used. This article describes a study of corrosion and scaling problems in the Afyonkarahisar Geothermal Heating System (AFJET) in Afyonkarahisar, Turkey. Water analysis, XRD, SEM, EDX, IC, ICP-OES analyses, and electrochemical methods were used in this study. Pentasodium triphosphate (Na3P3O10), maleic anhydride (C4H2O3), and 1,3-benzendisulfonic acid disodium salt (C6H4Na2O6S2) were used as corrosion inhibitors. Tests were carried out using geothermal water from AF11 well. The experimental temperatures were chosen as 298, 333, and 358 K Inhibitor concentrations were chosen as 1 x 10(-1), 1 x 10(-2), 1 x 10(-3), and 1 x 10(-4) mol/dm(3). Moreover, mixed inhibitor solutions were prepared using the inhibitor concentrations that showed the best inhibition. The first mixed inhibitor solution showed 96% inhibition. The second mixed inhibitor solution showed 90% inhibition. The tested inhibitors act as anodic inhibitors. XRD analysis shows that there is CaCO3 aragonite scaling in the system. Increasing TDS, alkalinity, and hardness all promote scale formation. The photomicrographs from SEM-EDX and the metallographic microscope show that the tested inhibitors form a protective film on the surface. IC and ICP-OES analyses show that the concentration of Ca2+ is very high, which supports scale formation.",
2435,"Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori among children in Sana'a, Yemen BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is primarily acquired in early childhood. Its transmission routes are debated. The aims of this study were to determine the seroprevalence of anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG) in Yemeni children under 10 years of age, the potential risk factors for contracting H. pylori infection and co-infection of H. pylori with intestinal parasites. METHODS: Enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay was used to determine the H. pylori prevalence rate among 572 healthy volunteers aged less than 10 years. Formalin ether concentration methods were used to test the prevalence of intestinal parasites (intestinal roundworms and tapeworms). In addition, we interviewed participants regarding potential risk factors for contracting H. pylori infection. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of H. pylori antibodies was 9%. The prevalence according to age varied from 0% in children under 2 years to 12.5% in age group 9-10 years. There was a correlation between the amounts of positive antibodies and increasing age. The prevalence rate of H. pylori antibodies was also significantly associated with the practice of drinking water from reused plastic jerry cans, with poor mouth hygiene and with co-infection by intestinal parasites. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of H. pylori antibodies in Yemen among children under 10 years of age is higher than that reported from other regions for the same age groups. Yemen shares some but not all potential risk factors for H. pylori infection with countries in which similar socioeconomic conditions are found. A possible way of eliminating H. pylori from the population would be via public health measures, i.e. preventing the reuse of plastic jerry cans, and improving sanitation and the standard of living.",
2436,"Diagenetic Environment of Sandstones from the Ermaying Formation (Middle Triassic), North-eastern Margin of the Ordos Basin, China: Implications for the Erosion Vulnerability of the Pi Sandstone A hard layer of calcite cemented sandstones overlaid weakly consolidated mudstones occur in the Middle Triassic, Ermaying Formation in the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin, China, were examined to reveal the diagenetic environment of Pi sandstone. The Pi sandstone refers to a type of terrigenous clastic rock assemblage composed mainly of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone with red and white color, which is characterized by exposing or being covered with sand or loess, vulnerable to weathering and erosion, distributed in the contiguous area of Shaanxi province, Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Shanxi province in China, and formed during Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic. The ""Pi"" comes from the folk name (pishuang) of arsenic in Chinese, the appellation of the ""Pi sandstone"" means that it is harmful to soil and water conservation. The Pi sandstone samples were collected from a sheet-like sandstones deposited in ephemeral river. Petrographic observation show that the samples studied carry a semi-arid climate signal, are cemented by mictrie (microcrystalline calcite), sparry (coarse-crystalline) calcite as well as quartz overgrowths. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of calcite in the studied are 6.2 to 3.8 parts per thousand PDB and from-10.2 to 8.9 parts per thousand PDB, respectively. The evidence from petrography and stable isotopes suggests that the cementation of the sandstone mainly occurred in the vadose - phreatic environment.",
2437,"Preliminary Study Contamination of Organochlorine Pesticide (Heptachlor) and Heavy Metal (Arsenic) in Shallow Groundwater Aquifer of Semarang Coastal Areas The present study was conducted to assess the level of pesticide and heavy metal contamination in shallow aquifer of Semarang coastal areas. Results indicated that Heptachlor and Arsenic were detected in the water samples in the range 0.023-0.055 mu g L-1 and 0,03-1,63 mu g L-1, respectively. Compared to the standard limits of the organochlorine contents in the water sample by World Health Organization (WHO) limits and Indonesian Drinking and Domestic Water Quality Standard for Ground Water (IWQS), groundwater of Semarang Coastal Areas was contaminated with pesticide and heavy metal. This study has proven the presence of organochlorine and heavy metal contamination of some shallow aquifer supplies in the coastal areas of Semarang.",
2438,"Evaluation of the impact of an uncontrolled landfill on surrounding groundwater quality, Zhoukou, China Our groundwater pollution investigation of an uncontrolled municipal landfill aims to better understand the possible impact of leachate percolation on groundwater quality. The study examined groundwater inorganic contamination around a municipal landfill site in Zhoukou city, Henan province, China. Stable isotopic compositions (8180 and delta H-2) and concentrations of various physico-chemical parameters were determined in surface and groundwater samples collected from the study area. 8180 and delta H-2 compositions reveal that elevation effects and/or evaporative processes occur to various extents prior to water reaching the saturated zone. There is no serious heavy metal contamination in this area. Principal component analysis was applied, and identified TDS, Cl-, NH4+, Fe and Mn concentrations as the main indicators of groundwater pollution caused by landfill leachate percolation. The groundwater quality of shallow aquifer is likely dominated by irrigation return flow in the summer. A two-dimensional advective-dispersive transport model was established using MODFLOW and MT3DMS to explore the controls on contaminant transport. Chloride transport simulations with steady state and transient flow models show that the contamination plume is still constrained in the upper aquifer after 13 years of operation of the landfill. The contrast between the simulated (relatively short) migration distance of the chloride plume, and the widely observed high chloride concentrations in the upper aquifer indicate other possible local contributions to the salinity of the aquifer. The transient model indicates that seasonal dynamics, such as temporal water level variations, may have a great influence on the migration of the plume beneath the landfill by controlling vertical hydraulic gradients and fluxes. In general, the shallow groundwater (within 30 m depth) around the Zhoukou landfill is not suitable for drinking, and pollution control should be improved and enhanced in this area.

2439,"Failure Investigation at a Collapsed Deep Excavation in Very Sensitive Organic Soft Clay Collapse of a 15.7-m-deep excavation in very sensitive organic soft clay in Hangzhou, China, is presented in this paper. The collapse of the excavation caused the break and/or inclination of the retaining walls, the wracking of the supporting system, significant sinking of a major road adjacent to the excavation site, and also the break in a water main beneath the road. After the collapse, the ground disturbance due to the collapse was investigated by cone penetration tests (CPTs) and field vane shear tests (VSTs). A simplified method, based on the CPT and VST test results, was used to evaluate the strength reduction ratio (SRR) of the in situ soils. According to the SRR values of the soils at different depths, the lower boundaries of the severely disturbed soils were determined and a possible slip failure surface passing through the bottom of the severely disturbed soils was justified. The factors of safety (FOSs) against basal heave of the excavation calculated from various methods were 1.05, 0.74 and 0.89, respectively. These computed values were much smaller than the corresponding recommended values. The stability number N of the excavation was calculated to be 7.4. The overall FOS was studied using the shear strength reduction technique based on a finite-element method (FEM) program. The FEM analysis results indicated that the FOS of the excavation was 0.97, and the computed slip failure surface fit well with that from the soil disturbance investigation. The failure mechanism of the excavation was then justified to be a basal heave. The main reasons leading to the collapse and lessons learned from the collapse are discussed. The investigation of the failure provides experiences and lessons for deep excavation design in very sensitive organic soft clay.",
2440,"Isomer profiles of perfluoroalkyl substances in water and soil surrounding a chinese fluorochemical manufacturing park Despite that China is the largest global manufacturer of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), the manufacturing methods and isomer purity of these chemicals are generally unknown. Here, sampling was conducted around a major fluorochemical manufacturing park in China in 2012, including soil and water collection inside the park, including from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), as well as in surrounding rivers and soil (âˆ¼15 km radius). Perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) were lower than perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in all samples, and short-chain (C4-C6) PFCAs were predominant. Perfluoroalkyl phosphonates and phosphate diesters were occasionally detected, but at low detection frequency. Branched isomers of perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS) are reported for the first time, accounting for 15-27% of total PFBS in water. An enrichment of isopropyl-PFOA (28%) was found in WWTP influent, suggesting its manufacturing primarily by isopropyl telomerization. More numerous branched isomers were observed for the longer C9-C13 PFCAs (e.g., C12 PFCA had 16 branched isomers), including high proportions of one major branched isomer (likely isopropyl), possibly as impurities from isopropyl-PFOA manufacturing. Overall, short-chain perfluorinated acids were the predominant PFASs being released, but PFOA was still a major chemical in use at this site, primarily from isopropyl telomerization.",
2441,"Water quality for human consumption in rural communities of the municipal district of Congo, PB The indiscriminate use of pesticides and fertilizers and the lack of treatment of the animal and human dejections have been reducing considerably the readiness of good quality water in the rural zone. The research was carried out to evaluate the quality of waters used for the human consumption in agricultural areas of Congo region, ParaÃ­ba State, Brazil. The water was collected in a dam, wells and in a river, in two periods of the year, rainy (May/2006) and dry (December/2006). The variables that were measured were pH, CE, Ca, Mg, Na, K, CO3, HCO3, Cl, SO4, Fe, alkalinity and total hardness. These variables increased in the dry period, except pH, whose variation was small. The chemical composition of all waters was similar, being predominantly, chloride and sodium salts. In both periods, the waters of the wells presented more salt than the dam and the river waters. In agreement with the results of the pH, cations and anions, more than 60% of the collected waters, in both periods of this study, were considered adequate for human consumption.",
2442,"Remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater using chemical reduction and solidification/stabilization method: a case study This study presents a systematic on-site remediation case involving both heavy metal and organic contaminants in soil and groundwater in a historically industrial-used site in Shanghai, China. Lab-scale experiments and field tests were conducted to determine the optimum parameters for the removal of contaminants in soil and groundwater. It has been found that the remediation goal of hexavalent chromium in soil could be achieved with the mass content of added sodium hydrosulfite and ferrous sulfate reaching 3%â€‰+â€‰6%. The total chromium in the groundwater was effectively removed, when the mass ratio of sodium metabisulfite was not less than 3Â g/L, and the added quick lime made pH value not less than 9. The concentrations of arsenic and 1,2-dichloropropane in the groundwater decreased evidently after extraction and mixing of groundwater. The pH and calcium chloride dosage added should be larger than 9.5 and 5Â g/L, respectively, to remove phosphate in groundwater. The removal efficiency of those contaminants was examined and evaluated after the on-site remediation. The results demonstrated that it was feasible to use the chemical reduction and solidification/stabilization methods for the on-site ex situ remediation of this site, which could be referenced for the realistic remediation of similar sites.",
2443,"Accumulation of organochlorine pesticides from water using triolein embedded cellulose acetate membranes A new type of composite membrane, triolein embedded cellulose acetate membrane (TECAM), was produced by embedding triolein drops in the matrix of cellulose acetate polymers. The distribution of six organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) between water and TECAM was investigated in a static water system. Its field application was tested in Taihu Lake (China). Results from both laboratory and field experiments indicate that TECAM quickly and efficiently accumulated hydrophobic OCPs from water. Under laboratory conditions, uptake equilibrium was achieved within 24 h for all of the six OCPs. Significant correlations were obtained between log Kp TECAM (TECAM-water partition coefficient) and log Kow (octanol-water partition coefficient); between log Ktw (triolein-water partition coefficient, triolein in TECAM) and log Kow; and between log Ktw and log BCF (bioconcentration factor in rainbow trout calculated from literatures). Triolein in TECAM significantly increased the accumulation of strongly hydrophobic OCPs when compared to the use of cellulose acetate polymers alone. Temperature had only slight effects on the Kp TECAM values of the strongly hydrophobic OCPs. The partition coefficient obtained by measuring OCP concentrations in TECAM under field conditions could be successfully applied to estimate OCPs concentrations in surface water.",
2444,"Ar-40/Ar-39 geochronology of supergene K-bearing sulfate minerals: Cenozoic continental weathering and its paleoclimatic significance in the Tu-Ha Basin, northwestern China Ar-40/Ar-39 incremental-heating analyses of supergene jarosite and yavapaiite were conducted for three weathering profiles at the Hongshan, Liuhuangshan, and Caihuagou deposits in the Tu-Ha Basin. The analyses provide numerical constraints on the timing and duration of weathering and supergene enrichment. Well constrained plateau ages and best-fitting inverse isochrons yield Ar-40/Ar-39 ages ranging from 33.3 +/- 0.5 Ma to 331 +/- 0.4 Ma (1 sigma). Our Ar-40/Ar-39 ages, combined with the published ages, indicate that a protracted history of weathering and supergene enrichment and, by inference, arid-semiarid climate (with at least a moderate amount of precipitation (>10 cm/y)) favorable to intense chemical weathering emerged at 33.3 Ma, 27.7-23.3 Ma, and 16.4-14.7 Ma, and prevailed from 11 to 7.8 Ma. Then, a progressive change from arid-semiarid toward hyperarid conditions and predominantly hyperarid conditions may have persisted since at least ca. 3.3 Ma. The climatic implications inferred from the weathering geochronology are in agreement with the chemical parameters and isotopic compositions of the Cenozoic sedimentary sequence from the Lianmuqin section in the Tu-Ha Basin, attesting to the reliability of weathering geochronology by the Ar-40/Ar-39 method as an indicator of paleoclimate in arid areas. Our results suggest that the retreat of the Paratethys Sea, which would have reduced eastward water vapor transport by the westerlies to the Tu-Ha Basin, led to its acidification in the Oligocene and that increased rain shadow effects, resulting from uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and Tian Shan Mountains, played important roles in the acidification history of the Tu-Ha Basin since the late Miocene.

2445,"Nitrate pollution and its transfer in surface water and groundwater in irrigated areas: a case study of the Piedmont of South Taihang Mountains, China Irrigation projects have diverted water from the lower reaches of the Yellow River in China for more than 50 years and are unique in the world. This study investigated the effect of irrigation practices on the transfer and regional migration mechanisms of nitrate (NO3(-)) in surface water and groundwater in a Yellow River alluvial fan. Hydrochemical indices (EC, pH, Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Cl(-), SO4(2-), and HCO(3-)) and stable isotopic composition (Î´18O and Î´D) were determined for samples. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to identify the sources of water constituents. Kriging was employed to simulate the spatial diffusion of NO3(-) and stable isotopes. Our results demonstrated that the groundwater exhibited more complex saline conditions than the surface water, likely resulting from alkaline conditions and lixiviation. NO3(-) was detected in all samples, 87.0% of which were influenced by anthropogenic activity. The NO3(-) pollution in groundwater was more serious than the common groundwater irrigation areas in the North China Plain (NCP), and was also slightly higher than that in surface water in the study area, but this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In addition, the groundwater sites with higher NO3(-) concentrations did not overlap with the spatial distribution of fertilizer consumption, especially in the central and western parts of the study area. NO3(-) distributions along the hydrogeological cross-sections were related to the groundwater flow system. Hydrochemical and environmental isotopic evidences indicate that surface water-groundwater interactions influence the spatial distribution of NO3(-) in the Piedmont of South Taihang Mountains.",
2446,"Fluorescence characterization of dissolved organic matter in an urban river and its complexation with Hg(II) Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Nanming River, an urban river in Guiyang City in SW China, and its complexation behavior with Hg(II) were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy and the quenching titration technique. Three major fluorophores, two humic-like and one protein-like fluorescence, were observed in most of the DOM samples. Significant correlations were observed between the humic-like and protein-like fluorescence intensities, as well as, between them and other water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon, PO43- chemical oxygen demand and NH4+ concentrations, suggesting that agricultural and municipal wastewaters may be the source for both protein-like and humic-like fluorescence materials in the river. The fluorescence quenching titration resulted in similar values for the conditional stability constants for Hg(H) complexes with the humic-like and protein-like fluorophores, likely due to the dominance of Hg binding with O-containing function groups at the high Hg(II) concentrations used in the titration. Effects of Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cu2+ ions on the binding between Hg(II) and three different fluorophores were also studied. The fluorescence index from the Nanming River was further found to be controlled by pH and Hg(II), cautioning its use in discriminating the sources of DOM. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2447,"HYDROCHEMICAL DISCHARGE OF RIVER WATERS OF SOUTHERN KHABAROVSK REGION IN THE PERIOD OF SUMMER HIGH WATER The relevance of the research consists in studying hydrochemical river discharge as one of the main indicators of the ecological state of water objects. The main aim of the research is to obtain new knowledge on hydrochemical discharge of the rivers at southern Khabarovsk region, which are required for objective assessment of the ecological status of the region and for carrying out effective water protection measures. Objects of the research are the Amur River and seven lesser streams: Bikin, Khor, Podkhorenok, Bira, Kiya, Malaya Chirka, 2-ya Sedmaya. Methods. Concentration of major anions (Cl-, SO42-) were analyzed by ion chromatography (Shimadzu LC-10A); major cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), trace elements and rare earth elements - with ICP-MS (Agilent, 7500c) method. The hydrocarbonate ion (HCO3-) concentration was taken as the total alkalinity. It was analyzed by direct titration by Bruyevich method. The total mineralization (Sigma i) is the sum of concentrations of major river water elements. Results. In July 2011 the Amur River and seven lesser streams (Bikin, Khor, Podkhorenok, Bira, Kiya, Malaya Chirka, 2-aya Sedmaya), located at southern part of Khabarovsk region, were sampled and analyzed for their major elements, trace elements and rare earth elements. During summer flood river waters are low-mineralizated, Si does not exceed 50 mg/l. Ca2+ is the predominant cation and HCO3- is the major counter-ion for cations in all samples. High concentrations of dissolved Al, Fe u Pb were found in the surface waters of all the rivers studied. In the Malaya Chirka River there are high concentrations of dissolved Co, Cu, Mn and extremely high Cd, exceeding the average global concentrations in 40 times. The concentration of the other trace elements in the studied rivers is in general corresponded to their average global concentrations and is a characteristic of the natural regional background during summer floods. A regional level of total concentrations of soluble forms of rare earth elements (1,44-5,44 mu g/l) was established. The distribution and level of rare earth elements concentrations in the studied river waters reflect the overall composition of the watershed rocks. The calculated total daily fluxes of major elements, trace elements and rare earth elements, supplied by the Bira, Kiya, Podhorenok, Bikin, Khor and Amur rivers, equal to 61894, 377 and 2,21 t/day, respectively.",
2448,"Combining molecular fingerprints with multidimensional scaling analyses to identify the source of spilled oil from highly similar suspected oils Oil fingerprints have been a powerful tool widely used for determining the source of spilled oil. In most cases, this tool works well. However, it is usually difficult to identify the source if the oil spill accident occurs during offshore petroleum exploration due to the highly similar physiochemical characteristics of suspected oils from the same drilling platform. In this report, a case study from the waters of the South China Sea is presented, and multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) is introduced to demonstrate how oil fingerprints can be combined with mathematical methods to identify the source of spilled oil from highly similar suspected sources. The results suggest that the MDS calculation based on oil fingerprints and subsequently integrated with specific biomarkers in spilled oils is the most effective method with a great potential for determining the source in terms of highly similar suspected oils.",
2449,"Modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in the north of Algeria using generalized regression neural networks (GRNN) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN): a comparative study Estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is needed to support irrigation design and scheduling, and watershed hydrology studies. There are many available methods to estimate evapotranspiration from a water surface, comprising both direct and indirect methods. In the first part of this study, the generalized regression neural networks model (GRNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) are developed and compared in order to estimate the reference ET0 for the first time in Algeria. Various daily climatic data, that is, daily mean relative humidity, sunshine duration, maximum, minimum and mean air temperature, and wind speed from Dar El Beida, Algiers, Algeria, are used as inputs to the GRNN and RBFNN models to estimate the ET0 obtained using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (PM56). The performances of the models are evaluated using root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott index of agreement (d) and correlation coefficient (CC) statistics. In the second part of the study, the empirical Hargreaves-Samani (HG) and Priestley-Taylor (PT) equations are also considered for the comparison. Based on the comparisons, the GRNN was found to perform better than the RBFNN, Priestley-Taylor and Hargreaves-Samani models. The RBFNN model is ranked as the second best model.",
2450,"Hydrochemical variations in selected geothermal groundwater and carbonated springs in Korea: a baseline study for early detection of CO(2) leakage A baseline hydrochemistry of the above zone aquifer was examined for the potential of CO(2) early detection monitoring. Among the major ionic components and stable isotope ratios of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, components with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of <10Â % for the seasonal variation were selected as relatively stable. These components were tested for sensitivity to the introduction of 0.1Â mol/LÂ CO(2) (g) using the PHREEQC simulation results. If the relatively stable components were sensitive to the introduction of CO(2), then they could be used as indicators of CO(2) leakage into the above zone. As an analog to the zone above CO(2) storage formation, we sampled deep groundwater, including geothermal groundwater from well depths of 400-700Â m below the ground surface (bgs) and carbonated springs with a high CO(2) content in Korea. Under the natural conditions of inland geothermal groundwater, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bicarbonate (HCO(3)), Î´(18)O, Î´(2)H, and Î´(13)C were relatively stable as well as sensitive to the introduction of CO(2) (g), thus showing good potential as monitoring parameters for early detection of CO(2) leakage. In carbonated springs, the parameters identified were pH, Î´(18)O, and Î´(2)H. Baseline hydrochemistry monitoring could provide information on parameters useful for detecting anomalies caused by CO(2) leakage as measures for early warning.",
2451,"Visualized Experimental Study of Nitrogen Injection Supression of Bottom Water Coning The reservoirs of volcanic rocks in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang in China are abundant in reserves with potential for exploration and development. They have the characteristics of high heterogeneity and fracture development. The occurrence of bottom water coning is a serious problem during oilfield development, which leads to a rapid increase in the well water cut and greatly affects the reservoir exploitation. In this paper, a visualized model experiment was carded out to simulate the mechanism of nitrogen injection suppression of bottom water coning, based on full diameter core with developed fracture, using X-ray imaging technology and oilfield tests. The research results show that nitrogen injection has a certain effect on suppressing bottom water coning. Nitrogen can block the high-permeability water flow channel, enter the low-permeability area, and improve fluidic', of the crude oil. The timing of nitrogen injection is the main controlling factor affecting gas injection development. Gas injection after a long-term high water cut period is the main reason for the poor ((MCI of suppression of bottom water coning in the oilfield. When the water cut is relatively low, the bottom water suppression effect is better. When the water cut is 70%-80%, the gas injection effect is the best. Moreover, the greater the nitrogen injection pressure and the longer the soak time, the better will be the effect of the bottom water coning suppression. In this paper, a reasonable development strategy of nitrogen injection to suppress bottom water coning is proposed through an experimental study, which is of great significance for guiding the development of volcanic reservoirs in the oiffield.",

2453,"Environmental impact of polluted city canals - a case study from Colombo, Sri Lanka The city canal of Colombo, an effluent canal running through the city, was monitored for its nitrogeneous species and toxic trace metal contents. The canal is the dumping ground for municipal garbage, human and animal excreta, organic waste matter, etc. However, nitrate content of the canal water remains low, indicating an incomplete nitrification process. Due to the existing pH and redox conditions, the nitrogen species are present in a chemically reduced form. Since the Pb, Cd, and Zn contents of the canal water are high, industrial contamination is obvious. The environmental impact of such a polluted canal is enhanced by the presence of a large number of drinking water wells in the vicinity of the canal. Â© 1984.",
2454,"A coastally improved global dataset of wet tropospheric corrections for satellite altimetry The accuracy of satellite radar altimetry (RA) is known to deteriorate towards the coastal regions due to several reasons, amongst which the improper account for the wet path delay (WPD) can be pointed out. The most accurate WPDs for RA are derived from the on-board microwave radiometer (MWR) radiance measurements, acquired simultaneously as the altimeter ranges. In the coastal zone, however, the signal coming from the surrounding land contaminates these measurements and the water vapour retrieval from the MWR fails. As meteorological models do not handle coastal atmospheric variability correctly yet, the altimeter measurements are rejected whenever MWR observations are absent or invalid. The need to solve this RA issue in the coastal zone, simultaneously responding to the growing demand for data in these regions, motivated the development of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) derived Path Delay (GPD) algorithm. GPD combines WPD from several sources through objective analysis (OA) to estimate the WPD or the corresponding RA correction accounting for this effect, the wet tropospheric correction (WTC), for all along-track altimeter points for which this correction has been set as invalid or is not defined. The current GPD version (GPD Plus, GPD C) uses as data sources WPD from coastal and island GNSS stations, from satellites carrying microwave radiometers, and from valid on-board MWR measurements. GPD C has been tuned to be applied to all, past and operational, RA missions, with or without an on-board MWR. The long-term stability of the WTC dataset is ensured by its inter-calibration with respect to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and SSM/I Sounder (SSMIS). The dataset is available for the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P); Jason-1 and Jason-2 (NASA and CNES); Jason-3 (NASA and EUMETSAT); ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat and CryoSat-2 (ESA); SARAL/AltiKa (ISRO and CNES); and GFO (US Navy) RA missions. The GPD C WTC for Sentinel-3 (ESA and EUMET-SAT) shall be released soon. The present paper describes the GPD C database and its assessment through statistical analyses of sea level anomaly (SLA) datasets, calculated with GPD C, the ECMWF Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) model or MWR-derived WTCs. Global results, as well as results for three regions (the North American and European coasts and the Indonesia region), are presented for ESA's recent Envisat Full Mission Reprocessing (FMR) V3.0. Global results show that the GPD C WTC leads to a reduction in the SLA variance of 1-2 cm(2) in the coastal zones, when used instead of the ERA WTC, which is one of the WTCs available in these products and can be adopted when the MWR-derived WTC is absent or invalid. The improvement of the GPD C WTC over the ERA WTC is maximal over the tropical oceans, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, showing that the model-derived WTC is not able to capture the full variability in the WPD field yet. The statistical assessment of GPD C for the North American coast shows a reduction in SLA variance, when compared to the use of the ERA-derived WTC, of 1.2 cm(2), on average, for the whole range of distances from the coast considered (0-200 km). Similar results are obtained for the European coasts. For the Indonesia region, the use of the GPD C WTC instead of that from ERA leads to an improvement, on average, on the order of 2.2 cm(2) for distances from the coast of up to 100 km. Similar results have been obtained for the remaining missions, particularly for those from ESA. Additionally, GPD+ recovers the WTC for a significant number of along-track altimeter points with missing or invalid MWR-derived WTCs, due to land, rain and ice contamination and instrument malfunctioning, which otherwise would be rejected. Consequently, the GPD+ database has been chosen as the reference WTC in the Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (CCI) products; GPD+ has also been adopted as the reference in CryoSat-2 Level-2 Geophysical Ocean Products (GOP). Strategies to further improve the methodology, therefore enhancing the quality of the database, are also discussed. The GP + dataset is archived on the home page of the Satellite Altimetry Group, University of Porto, publicly available at the repository https://doi.org/10.23831/FCUP_UPORTO_GPDPlus_v1.0 (Fernandes et al., 2019).",
2455,"Linking Ecosystem Services to Social Well-Being: An Approach to Assess Land Degradation Land degradation usually leads to the loss of ecosystem services, which may threaten social well-being. There is no approach to identify and manage all ecosystem services based on their importance in degradation processes and social systems. This study aimed to link ecosystem services to social well-being in order to assess rangeland degradation. Eleven ecosystem services (forage production, water yield, edible plants, fuel, medicinal plants, pollination, gas regulation, soil resistivity to erosion, soil fertility, scenic beauty, and recreation) were assessed in a semiarid rangeland near Bardsir city, Kerman Province, southeast Iran. There were significant differences between the rangeland types in providing ecosystem services (p < 0.05). Four criteria and 17 indices of social well-being were weighed according to their importance for local stakeholders. Rangeland degradation was estimated using the weight of the indices for social well-being and ecosystem services. Discriminant analysis indicated that supporting services (soil fertility) and provisioning services (water yield and forage production) had the greatest impact on rangeland degradation, which is related to food security in social well-being. Ecosystem services and social well-being declined in medium and severe degradation due to plant composition change and overgrazing based on principal component analysis (PCA). More than 70% of the watershed has been highly and severely degraded. There was a trade-off relationship between ecosystem services and social well-being in very severe degraded areas because of social well-being promotion due to agriculture expansion. Based on our approach, the loss rate of the ecosystem services and social well-being indices in each degradation category is a good guide for management programs and decision-makers to meet both the needs of the people and the preservation of ecosystems.",
2456,"Comparison of UV-LEDs and LPUV on inactivation and subsequent reactivation of waterborne fungal spores Recently, the contamination of fungi in water supply systems has been an area of increasing concern, such as Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. It can cause some waterborne issues such as odor, taste and formation of mycotoxins. Ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) are considered as a potential alternative to conventional mercury lamps for water disinfection. This study has compared the performance of LPUV (low pressure ultraviolet) and UV-LEDs with emissions at 265, 280Â nm and combination emissions at 265/280Â nm to test inactivation efficiency, reactivation, viability and electrical energy consumption in the treatment of three water-borne fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium polonicum, Trichoderma harzianum) at a batch water disinfection system. The results showed that the performances of UV-LEDs were superior for the inactivation of fungal spores compared to the 254Â nm (LP), while no statistically differences were observed among the UV-LEDs (pÂ >Â 0.05). The average photoreactivation rate (k(1)) of fungal spores irradiated by UV-LEDs and 254Â nm (LP) follows the order: T.Â harzianumÂ >Â A.Â nigerÂ >Â P. polonicum. Compared with LPUV, UV-LEDs irradiation at 280Â nm and 265/280Â nm more efficiently inhibits photoreactivation, which was attributed to that irradiation of 280Â nm and 265/280Â nm would cause greater membrane damage and increase intracellular reactive oxygen species level of fungal spores according to the flow cytometric results. The electrical energy consumption of UV-LEDs was higher than that of LPUV, which was due to its lower wall plug efficiency. The results of this study can provide additional and beneficial information for the reasonable exploitation of UV-LEDs in water disinfection.",
2457,"Overcoming challenges to accelerating linear growth in Indian children This policy review highlights the need to focus on stunting as an indicator of under-five undernutrition and explores the major challenges and priority public health options for accelerating linear growth in children. Early childhood stunting predicts poor human capital including shorter adult height, lower attained schooling, reduced adult income, and decreased offspring birth weight. The current prevalence of stunting is disconcerting but there has been a relatively faster decline recently. It is imperative to intervene before birth to address stunting. Pertinent ongoing interventions (delaying early child birth, adequate antenatal care and maternal iron-folate supplementation) are beneficial but have sub-optimal coverage. There is only a narrow window of opportunity in early life--the first two years. Effective coverage of children below two years of age with a package of interventions (breastfeeding; immunization; appropriate complementary feeding; treatment of infections, especially diarrhea; safe water supply; and sanitation) merits urgent investigation for greater impact.",
2458,"Environmental reconnaissance of the Shivee-Ovoo coalmine area, Mongolia An exploratory investigation was conducted to assess the present conditions and evaluate the potential impacts of mining activities on soil and water environments at the Shivee-Ovoo coalmine area in Mongolia. Water quality analysis was conducted on samples from mine dewatering boreholes, a tailings dam, and drinking water sources around the mine area. In drinking water supplies of the area, concentrations of Mg, Fe, and F exceeded the levels set in Mongolian and World Health Organization guidelines. Water type and the principal components analysis indicated that water from the mine area and from public water-supply wells originated from the same aquifer. However, the water quality differed in shallow wells and deep wells because of bedrock differences and geochemical weathering processes, rather than climate effects such as from evaporation. The discharged water poses medium to high salinity hazard for use in irrigation, suggesting the need to manage its use in sustainable agriculture or projects to prevent desertification. The particle size distribution and fractal dimension values of soils revealed the dominance of fine to medium sands, which have strong potential for desertification. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the soils currently pose no apparent threat for acid rock drainage. Consequently, the open-pit mining of the study area shows no obvious environmental impact at present in its vicinity. However, for sustainable development and expansion of the mine, environmental changes should be continuously monitored, with consideration of possible measures for waste recycling.",
2459,"Assessment of adoption potential of rooftop rainwater harvesting to combat water scarcity: a case study of North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India Rural households of the North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India, have been drinking arsenic and iron-contaminated water from shallow tube wells over nearly four decades. In the present study, an attempt is made to establish a relationship between rooftop rainwater harvesting potential and socio-economic status to combat qualitative and quantitative water stress. Multiple linear regression is applied to 923 rural household data collected through a rigorous socio-economic survey. Five variables, i.e., costly asset, less costly asset, monthly savings, use of unsafe drinking water, and less family size, are found statistically significant for the feasibility of rooftop rainwater harvesting after performing multiple linear regression. The Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) also showed increase in concrete and asphalt surfaces which also emphasizes the necessity of rainwater harvesting (RWH). Results would help local authorities to execute the RWH schemes in contaminated areas and thereby reducing the dependence on groundwater.",

2461,"Comparative study on the water quality status of Andra reservoir and Denkada anicut constructed on Champavati River, Vizianagaram, India The author's present study was carried out for a period of 3 years from 2010 to 2013 to itemize the various physico-chemical parameters, irrigation water quality parameters and heavy metals in Champavathi River waters at Andra reservoir and Denkada anicut. Water samples were collected from the chosen sampling stations of the two reservoirs for every 4 months and analyzed as per APHA standard methods. The results obtained were compared with IS 10500 standards and found to be well within the prescribed values. Though the obtained values were well within the prescribed standard values, it was found that the water quality index, concentration of certain parameters such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium of the waters of Andra reservoir are higher than that of the Denkada anicut, and the concentration of nitrite was found to be higher in the water sample analyzed from Denkada anicut. Except silicon, all the other metals were found to be below the detection limits in the two reservoir waters. The reasons for the same were probed by the authors in the presented study. From the analysis reports, it was found that the water analyzed from the two reservoirs was fit for irrigation, agriculture, industrial and domestic purposes.",
2462,"ISOMORPHISM OF EVIDENCE IN MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES: A STUDY AMONG COMPANIES IN THE MINERAL WATER INDUSTRY OF PARAIBA Through the lens of New Institutional Sociology, the management accounting practices can be institutionalized in organizations that seek legitimacy, which in turn lead them to be more similar amongst themselves, being this ""homogenization"" captured by isomorphism. The objective of this paper was to investigate the management accounting practices among companies dedicated to the production of bottled mineral water in State of Paraiba, Brazil, looking for evidences of isomorphism. For the operationalization of this research, an exploratory and descriptive study of a qualitative nature, was carried out through semistructured interviews with its managers within four of these companies, all of them registered in the Federation of Paraiba State Industries - FIEP-PB.

2464,"Development of water quality criteria for arsenic to protect aquatic life based on species sensitivity distribution Arsenic is a hazardous environmental pollutant widely distributed globally. Arsenic toxicity is well known and it is regulated by many countries in terms of managing water quality and protecting aquatic organisms. Unfortunately, water quality criterion (WQC) to protect aquatic organisms has not been introduced in Korea yet. Thus, it is of great importance and necessity to introduce WQC to protect aquatic organisms from arsenic, as WQC play a significant role in protecting aquatic ecosystems from pollutants. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to derive arsenic water quality criterion for aquatic life in Korea. Arsenic acute toxicity tests were performed with 10 Korean native aquatic species, which belong to 7 different taxonomic groups. Based on the results of acute toxicity test and additional toxicity data from literature, the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method was used in ecological risk assessment. The arsenic concentration of 95% protection level for aquatic life was 0.229â€¯mgâ€¯L(-1) in this study. An assessment factor 3 and a background concentration 0.0004â€¯mgâ€¯L(-1) were applied to the concentration value in consideration of the uncertainty of the data and the amount of arsenic natural generation. Consequently, the WQC value derived for arsenic was found to be 0.077â€¯mgâ€¯L(-1). These results will serve as reference values to establish water quality criterion for the protection of aquatic life in Korea.",
2465,"Occurrence of natural radioactivity and corresponding health risk in groundwater with an elevated radiation background in Juban District, Yemen This study aims to investigate the occurrence of natural radiation in groundwater with an elevated background level in Juban District, Yemen, and to assess the corresponding health risk. The mean concentrations of U, Th, and K in groundwater were 11.25, 0.15, and 17.35 mg l(-1), respectively. The mean activity concentrations of Ra-226, Ra-228, and K-40 were 94, 216, and 3306 mBq l(-1), respectively. 65 % of the groundwater samples were above the WHO guidance level for Ra-228 in water. The maximum concentrations of Ra-226, Th, and Ra-228 were found around the fault zones in the basement aquifer while the concentrations of U increase down-gradient of Juan District. The principal factors controlling the occurrence and concentrations of radionuclides are aquifer type, leaching behaviour, characteristics of fracture systems, salinity, and water flow path. The annual effective doses due to ingestion of the water were estimated for infant and adult groups. The mean annual effective dose for infants was 1.97 mSv year(-1) which is almost twenty times the WHO guideline level for drinking water. The ingestion dose deduced for adults and infants is dominated by Ra-228, where the average contribution from Ra-228 in infants amounted to 90 % and in adults 76 %.",
2466,"Effect of the Indian Ocean tsunami on groundwater quality in coastal aquifers in eastern Sri Lanka Changes in water quality of a sand aquifer on the east coast of Sri Lanka due to the December 26, 2004 tsunami and subsequent disturbance due to well pumping and flushing by precipitation were investigated. Two closely spaced tsunami affected transects, spanning the ocean and an interior lagoon across a 2 km wide land strip were monitored from October, 2005 to September, 2006. Water samples were collected from 15 dug wells and 20 piezometers, from the disturbed and undisturbed sites respectively to evaluate the temporal and spatial trends in water quality. The EC values observed from the undisturbed area showed a significant decrease (3000 to 1200 Î¼S/cm) with the rain from November 2005 to March 2006, while the values in the disturbed area appeared to have stabilized without further decline through the same period. The concentration range of EC, Ca, K, Na, alkalinity, total hardness and sulphate were higher in the disturbed site than in the undisturbed site. PHREEQC modeling showed that the mixed sea water fraction is higher in the disturbed site than in the undisturbed site, and this is likely due to the movement of the disturbed plume by water extraction through pumping and extensive well cleaning after the tsunami, causing forced diffusion and dispersion. No arsenic contamination was observed as all observed arsenic concentrations were below 10 Î¼g/L. For the sites investigated, there are clear indications of only a slow recovery of the aquifer with time in response to the onset of the monsoon.",
2467,"An Enquiry into Equity Impact of Groundwater Markets in the Context of Subsidised Energy Pricing: A Case Study In India, groundwater over-extraction is often linked with subsidized electricity in the agricultural sector. Proponents of electricity subsidy argue that such a subsidy helped even the resource-poor farmers to have had access to groundwater irrigation. This article explores inter- and intra-generational equity implications of groundwater markets in the context of subsidized electricity where the market enables even non-well owners to access groundwater for irrigation. The study is based on survey data collected from two districts in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The sample includes farmers who use electricity- and diesel-powered pumps to lift groundwater. The structure of the existing water market is examined through the determination of the water price-cost ratio. The article finds that, in the short run, water markets improve accessibility to groundwater irrigation, particularly for marginal and small farmers. With the help of this, farmers are able to mitigate water-scarcity-related vulnerabilities. However, in the long run, electricity subsidy may have negative dynamic implications by causing over-exploitation of groundwater that reduces the volume of groundwater available for future agricultural use. In other words, this article finds that, in the initial phases of the development of the water markets, there are intra-generational equity implications. However, in the advanced phases, the unsustainable extraction of groundwater could lead to inter-generational inequities.",
2468,"The nature and extent of arsenic-affected drinking water in Bangladesh The people of Bangladesh used to rely on surface water for drinking, which was often infected with cholera and other life-threatening diseases. To reduce the incidences of these diseases, millions of tubewells were installed in Bangladesh over the last 27 years. This recent transition from surface water to groundwater has significantly reduced deaths from water-borne pathogens; however, recent evidence suggests disease and death from arsenic and potentially other metals in groundwater are impacting large areas of Bangladesh. In this preliminary assessment the areal and vertical distribution of arsenic and other inorganic chemicals in the groundwater was mapped throughout Bangladesh. The study suggests that a major source of this arsenic may be one or more phosphate minerals containing arsenate as an impurity. Evidence for other potentially toxic heavy metals in groundwater was also discovered. Several appropriate treatment technologies were evaluated.",
2469,"Hydrogeochemical Characterization and Quality Assessment of Groundwater in a Long-Term Reclaimed Water Irrigation Area, North China Plain Water scarcity has led to wide use of reclaimed water for irrigation worldwide, which may threaten groundwater quality. To understand the status of groundwater in the reclaimed water irrigation area in Beijing, 87 samples from both shallow and deep aquifers were collected to determine the factors affecting groundwater chemistry and to assess groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes. The results show that groundwater in both shallow and deep aquifers in the study area is weakly alkaline freshwater with hydrogeochemical faces dominated by HCO3-Na MgCa , HCO3-Mg CaNa , HCO3-Ca Na , and HCO3-Na. The chemical composition of groundwater in both shallow and deep aquifers is dominantly controlled by the dissolution of halite, gypsum, anhydrite, and silicates weathering, as well as ion exchange. Geogenic processes (rock weathering and ion exchange) are the only mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry in deep aquifers. Besides geogenic processes, evaporation and anthropogenic activities also affect the chemistry of shallow groundwater. Quality assessment reveals that both shallow and deep groundwater are generally suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes. The quality of deep groundwater is more excellent for drinking than shallow groundwater. However, long-term use of deep groundwater for irrigation exhibits higher potential risks to deteriorate soil property due to the relative higher permeability indexes (PI). Therefore, it is recommended that deep groundwater is preferentially used for drinking and domestic purpose, and shallow groundwater for agricultural irrigation.",
2470,"A dugwell program to provide arsenic-safe water in West Bengal, India: preliminary results In 1982, Dr. K. C. Saha, a dermatologist of Calcutta, West Bengal, identified patients with skin lesions from the district of 24 Parganas, leading him and others to search for a cause. The cause was soon identified to be arsenic in drinking water, but even today, 20 years later, large number of people continue to drink arsenic contaminated water and patients are increasing in number. Project Well is a program chosen for implementation in some villages of North 24 Parganas. Arsenic safe drinking water is provided for adopted villages by constructing shallow, concrete dugwells designed to tap the water of the unconfined aquifer, 20-30 feet below ground level, that contains low levels (< 0.05 mg/L) of arsenic in the target region. The traditional dugwell design is modified by use of tube well hand pumps to withdraw water. The project includes community involvement, programs to increase awareness of the need to drink arsenic safe water, and training in monitoring of dugwell water for arsenic and harmful pathogens. Disinfecting of the water and regulating the water hazard diagram are also included in the training program. The plan is to make the system sustainable at the village level using indigenous labor and materials.",
2471,"Fuzzy Based Smart Farming using Wireless Sensor Network India is diverse country having variety in the agricultural crop for meeting the need of living being in different part of the country. Agriculture is one of the major sources of the economy for the people of India. The continuous demand for quality foods forces for innovation in food production technology as greenhouse farm. Food production mainly depends on weather condition and agriculture methods. The uncertainty nature of weather makes agriculture difficult for good crop cultivation. The scarcity of rainfall forces farmer to uses continuous other sources of water (tube-well, water pump) for crop cultivation. The crop production is based on temperature, humidity and soil moisture as a parameter for the production of the crop. The paper proposes a fuzzy based system leading to smart farming for effective growth of agriculture in India. The objective of model is used to monitor farm for efficient utilization of water. The proposed model shows the significant utilization of water in irrigation and is beneficial for the limited water area.",

2474,"Efficient Covalent Modification of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes with Diazotized Dyes in Water at Room Temperature Tetrafluoroborate salts of diazotized Azure A (AA-N(2)(+)), Neutral Red (NR-N(2)(+)) and Congo Red (CR-N(2)(+)) dyes were prepared and reacted with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at room temperature, in water without any reducing agent. The as-modified MWCNTs were examined by IRATR, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, TGA, TEM, and cyclic voltammetry. The diazonium band located at âˆ¼2350 cm(-1) in the diazotized dye IR spectra vanished after attachment to the nanotubes whereas the Raman D/G peak ratio slightly increased after dye covalent attachment at a high initial diazonium/CNT mass ratio. XPS measurements show the loss of F 1s from the BF(4)(-) anion together with a clear change in the high-resolution C 1s region from the modified nanotubes. Thermogravimetric analyses proved substantial mass loadings of the organic grafts leveling off at 40.5, 34.3, and 50.7 wt % for AA, NR, and CR, respectively. High-resolution TEM pictures confirmed the presence of 1.5-7-nm-thick continuous amorphous layers on the nanotubes assigned to the aryl layers from the dyes. Cyclic voltammetry studies in acetonitrile (ACN) confirmed the grafting of the dyes; the latter retain their electrochemical behavior in the grafted state. The experimental results correlate remarkably well with quantum chemical calculations that indicate high binding energies between the dyes and the CNTs accounting for true covalent bonding (140-185 kJ/mol with the CNT-aryl distance <1.6 nm), though attachment by Ï€ stacking also contributes to obtaining stable hybrids. Finally, the pH-responsive character of the robust hybrids was demonstrated by a higher degree of protonation of Neutral Red-grafted CNTs at pH 2 compared to that of the neutral aqueous medium. This work demonstrates that diazotized dyes can be employed for the surface modification of MWCNTs in a very simple and efficient manner in water and at room temperature. The hybrids could be employed for many purposes such as optically pH-responsive materials, biosensors, and optothermal composite actuators to name a few.",
2475,"[The effectiveness of the application of medicinal mineral water from the 'Omonkhona' source in the patients presenting with the diseases of the hepatobiliary system] BACKGROUND: Investigations into the medicinal properties of 'Omonkhona' mineral water used for the treatment of hepatobiliary pathology make up the entirely new field of balneological research in Uzbekistan. AIM: The objective of the present study was to identify the hepatoprotective and choleretic components of the 'Omonkhona' mineral water and elucidate their action in the patients presenting with the diseases of the hepatobiliary system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 77 patients suffering from the diseases of the hepatobiliary system were available for the examination including 38 patients with chronic hepatitis (CH), 17 with chronic cholecystitis (CC), and 22 patients with liver cirrhosis (Cr). All the patient were prescribed drinking the mineral water (from 1.0 to 3.0 liters per day) during consequtive 12-14 days. The clinical, biochemical, and instrumental studies were carried before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The treatment with 'Omonkhona' water resulted either in the complete elimination or the significant alleviation of pain in the right hypochondrium. The patients presenting with CH and CC experienced normalization of ESR even though it remained high in the Cr patients. All the patients exhibited a decrease of specific gravity of the urine, probably due to the diuretic effect of the mineral water. The biochemical studies of blood and bile showed that the initially slightly enhanced bilirubin levels, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities in the CH and CC patients normalized after a course of the treatment with 'Omonkhona' mineral water (p<0.05). No such changes were documented in the patients with liver cirrhosis. The patients with CH and CC experienced the two-fold reduction in the intensity of inflammation whereas the bilirubin and bile acid levels increased although the relative cholesterol content decreased and the cholate-cholesterol coefficient increased (p<0.05). The Cr patients demonstrated only insignificant changes of these parameters. The ultrasound examination showed that the CC patients treated with 'Omonkhona' mineral water had a decrease in the swelling of the gallbladder walls, the improvement of its motor function and the disappearance of the stagnation phenomenon. In the CH patients, there was a significant decrease in the cranio-caudal size of the right lobe of the liver, the cranio-caudal size of the left lobe, and the anteroposterior size of the left lobe (p<0.05). A decrease in the acoustic conductivity was noted that can probably be attributed to the reduced swelling of the liver parenchyma. The Cr patients had no significant changes of these parameters following the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study give evidence that the treatment of the diseases of the hepatobiliary system with 'Omonkhona' mineral water exerts the well apparent positive influence on the patients presenting with CC and CH even though its beneficial effect was less pronounced in the patients with livre cirrhosis.",
2476,"A novel thermostable, acidophilic alpha-amylase from a new thermophilic ""Bacillus sp. Ferdowsicous"" isolated from Ferdows hot mineral spring in Iran: Purification and biochemical characterization This paper describes the purification and characterization of a novel acidophile alpha-amylase from newly isolated Bacillus sp. Ferdowsicous. The enzyme displayed a molecular weight of 53 kDa and it was stable over a range of pH from 3.5 to 7 with an optimum around 4.5. The optimum temperature for activity was found to be around 70 degrees C and the enzyme remained active to more than 75% up to 75 degrees C for 45 min. The enzyme activity was decreased by Zn(2+)and EDTA but inhibited by Hg(2+), whereas the activity was increased by approximately 15% by Ba(2+) and Fe(2+). Na(+), Mg(2+), K(+), Ca(2+), PMSF, Triton X-100 and beta-mercaptoethanol had any considerable effect on its activity. The enzyme activity on the amylose as substrate was 1.98 times greater than amylopectin. Partial N-terminal sequencing demonstrated no significant similarity with other known alpha-amylases, indicating that the presented enzyme was new. Considering its promising properties, this enzyme can find potential applications in the food industry as well as in laundry detergents.",
2477,"The search for Orsten-type fossils in southern China Orsten-type fossils, mainly arthropod juveniles and even tiny embryos exquisitely preserved in apatite, have been well documented from several localities in southern China. This particular type of Lagerstatte is known from just a few places around the world but has led to significant breakthrough's in the understanding of the early diversity of animals and evolution of metazoans. The original 'orsten' from southern Sweden are limestone concretions within black shales, whereas in China this kind of preservation occurs in lime mudstone thin beds and nodules interbedded with shale. Thus there is a taphonomic bias in that this kind of preservation is localized to a deeper water carbonate facies which can be regarded as concretionary due to early cementation under shallow burial. Nonetheless, we observe that even within a laterally extensive bed of the seemingly appropriate lithofacies, preservation may be highly localized. Thus, in addition to the extreme rarity of Orsten-type preservation globally, serendipity in discovering fossiliferous localities plays a significant role. Because of their predominant occurrence in the Cambrian they are also a temporally restricted window. To extract Orsten-type material from the limestone matrix, mild acetic acid digestion has been widely applied, but certain procedures can be employed to aid recovery by limiting damage to these delicate but fragile specimens. Here, we describe our method for etching out specimens and review some of the discoveries recently made in southern China.

2478,"Defect-rich, negatively-charged SnS2 nanosheets for efficient photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and organic dye adsorption in water Nanostructures of layered materials have gained increasing attention in photocatalytic and watertreatment processes. Herein, we report on sub-30 nm SnS2 nanosheets (NSs) which can perform photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) quite efficiently on one hand, while removes large quantities of toxic organic dye molecules by choosing an adsorption mode of operation over photo-degradation on the other hand, unlike most other SnS2 nanostructures. The NSs have a highly extended crystallinity growing perpendicular to the (001) lattice direction but exhibit poor X-ray diffraction for the 10 l (1 = 1,2,3...) lattice planes. With such defects, the NSs have a narrow bandgap of 2.21 eV and exhibit a significant photocurrent density at near band-edge illumination. Cr(VI) photo-reduction using the SnS2 NSs follows a first-order reaction kinetics (rate constant of 0.10 min(-1)), five-fold higher than commercial TiO2 (P-25). Furthermore, the NSs adsorb Rhodamine B dye molecules from an aqueous solution by forming a monolayer of dye molecules following a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and exhibit an adsorption capacity of similar to 53.28 mg/g. We show that the NSs have a Zeta potential of similar to -22 eV and preferably adsorb cationic dyes only. Thus the SnS2 NSs can be effective for Cr(VI) contaminated waste-water treatment in a photocatalytic manner and can also act as a potential adsorbent for polluting dye molecules either in the presence or absence of sunlight. While both these activities are known for SnS2 as well as other materials, the competitive nature of the two mechanisms while each of them is a possibility has never been investigated. Therefore, besides the high activities, the study highlights the presence of different active sites on the material surface that can respond preferentially to either inorganic or organic impurities.

2479,"Full-Scale Application of Catalytic Ozonation for Drinking Water Treatment: Case Study in China A combination process of biofiltration, conventional treatment, catalytic ozonation and upflow biological activated carbon (BAC) is adopted for treating micropolluted raw water in Guanjinggang waterworks in China, and the present investigation mainly focuses on the effect of catalytic ozonation on the performance of BAC and on water quality over a long period of 699 days. The quality of finished water produced by the combination process is found to fully meet the drinking water standard of China. The removal efficiency of CODMn by catalytic ozonation is usually in the range of 10-20%, and this removal efficiency is independent of the CODMn concentration of the influent and water temperature. Catalytic ozonation can enhance the biodegradability of the effluent, and favors the following BAC. Catalytic ozonation also removes some ammonia and transforms organic nitrogen into NH4+-N. A slight increase of turbidity and manganese ion levels after catalytic ozonation are also found in many cases. Overall, the effectiveness of pollutant removal and the low operation cost make catalytic ozonation suitable for micropolluted raw water treatment in developing countries.

2480,"Implications of desalination for water resources in China - an economic perspective China is a country with severe water shortages. Water is becoming scarcer due to population growth, industrialization and urbanization. Recent studies show that by the next 50 years water resources per capita will go down to around 1700 m(3), which is the threshold of severe water scarcity. Especially in North China, water shortage has become a critical constraint factor for socioeconomic development in the long run. To solve or eliminate water shortage problems, seawater desalination draws more and more attention as an alternative water supply source. The objective of the study is to assess the potential of desalination as a viable alternate water source for China through analysis of the costs of desalination, the water demand and supply situation as well as water pricing practices in China. Based on the investment costs and estimated operation and maintenance costs, an economic appraisal for the costs of desalination for two main processes, MSF and RO, has been conducted. The study shows that there is a decline of unit cost of desalination over time and the average unit cost of the RO process was lower than that of the MSF process. A unit cost of 0.6 $/m(3) for desalting brackish water and 1.0 $/m(3) for seawater are suggested to be appropriate for the potential application of desalination in China. Future trends and challenges associated with water shortages and water prices are discussed, leading to conclusions and recommendations regarding the role of desalination as a feasible source of water for the future.",
2481,"Screening and quantitation of residual antibiotics in two different swine wastewater treatment systems during warm and cold seasons Due to many occurrences of the illegal addition, misuse and abuse of antibiotics in the swine industry in China, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to screen and identify these materials in two swine wastewater treatment systems (Swine farm 1: anaerobic digestion - lagoon treatment; Swine farm 2: anaerobic digestion - anoxic treatment - aerobic biological treatment). The results showed that 11 out of 115 antibiotics, including tetracyclines (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline), sulfonamides (sulfadimidine (SDMD)), macrolides (clarithromycin, tilmicosin (TILM)), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin), Î²â€‘lactam (penicillin G), and lincosamides (lincomycin), were identified in the swine farms by screening and confirmation methods through HRMS. The quantification method was carried out using triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry, and the recoveries of 11 analytes in the swine wastewater were above 50%. The investigation results showed that the amount of antibiotic residues during the cold season was much higher than that during the warm season. Among the antibiotics, tetracyclines (average of 58%) were the main antibiotic residues in the two swine farms, with TILM second (33%). Sulfonamides (SDMD) existed only in SF1 and accounted for 10% of the total antibiotic concentration. The average proportion of total antibiotics in the solid and liquid phases were 98.5% and 1.5%, respectively, indicating that antibiotics were mainly adsorbed onto solids, though only SDMD remained relatively high in the liquid phase (5.29%). The degradation data of most of the antibiotics detected in the liquid phase during the wastewater treatments well fitted the simple first-order kinetic model in both SF1 and SF2, and the half-lives of the analytes in SF2 were much shorter than those in SF1. After the wastewater treatment process, approximately 80% of the antibiotics could be removed, but sulfonamides remained at a relatively higher percentage and were the main antibiotics in the effluent (approximately 60%).",

We describe the first use of the Wax moth larva Galleria mellonella, a well-established model for the mammalian innate immune system, to selectively enrich and characterize pathogens from coastal environments in the South West of the UK. Whole-genome sequencing of highly virulent isolates revealed amongst others a Proteus mirabilis strain carrying the Salmonella SGI1 genomic island not reported from the UK before and the recently described species Vibrio injenensis hitherto only reported from human patients in Korea. Our novel method has the power to detect bacterial pathogens in the environment that potentially pose a serious risk to public health.",
2483,"Pollution Index and Ecological Risk of Heavy Metals in the Surface Soils of Amir-Abad Area in Birjand City, Iran Background: In the present era, the concentration of heavy metals in the environment is increasing. Due to the deleterious effects of these metals on human health as well as their dangerous consequences on ecosystem, special attention should be paid to remove them from the environment. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the ecological risk of heavy metals including lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr) in surface soils of an Amir-Abad Area in Birjand City, Iran. Materials and Methods: Soil Samples were collected from a depth of 0-20 cm at 16 stations with different users. The samples were passed through a 2-mm sieve after air drying. To determine the concentration of heavy metals, the samples were extracted by acid chloride and nitric acid and total concentrations of toxic elements were read using the atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The pollution index and ecological risk assessments were calculated for each element. Results: The results showed that the ecological risk of surface soil for the users of the road-residential was high (1370.72) and notable (505.04), and the agricultural land use and livestock had the moderate ecological risk and dairy farm had low ecological risk. When the results of this study were compared to world standards, it was suggested that the areas with the road-residential areas were considered to be dangerous to health; this was directly related to developments of technology and pollution. Conclusions: It can be concluded that residential-road land uses show the considerable pollution index and ecological risk.",
2484,"The Salt Marsh (Sabkha) in the Western Part of Libya The total coastline of Libya is about 1975 km long. Numerous salt marshes bordered by sabkhas occur along the coast. These sabkhas cover some a very large area on the coast line and most of them are completely dry during the summer season. One of the larger sabkhas is located in the western part of Libya and is called ""the Abu Kammash salt marsh (Abu Kammash subkha)"" and it is found along the coastal Libyan-Tunisian highway about 150 km west of Tripoli in the Abu Kammash area near the Tunisian border, at an altitude of 2.5-4.0 m below sea level. This is a typical salt marsh of coastal Mediterranean region. It is generally a flat sabkha with a total area of about 50 km(2). There are 38 wells in the sabkha, from which brine water is pumped through pipelines to Abu Kammash factory (chemical plant) which was established on the area near the seashore for the mass production of pure salt and bleaching agents. The saline ponds and pools are formed when such low land area floods in rainy winters, and 12 km long and 4 km wide small seasonal lake is formed. In summer, however, most of these lakes dry up. The high salinity and evaporation lead to precipitation of a thick layer of salt on the sabkha floor. The phytoplankton density is quite low. The sabkha has been identified as a natural biotope for brine shrimp (Artemia). Next to the Artemia comes the birds which are also found in moderate number. Majority of the birds are migratory, as such the sabkha may serve as good refuge for such birds provided certain measures are taken. There is a very poor vegetation cover composed mainly of halophytes and desert plant taxa around the sabkha due to coarse sand texture and prevailing semiarid conditions.",

2486,"Relationship between diagenesis and the emplacement of bitumen in the Lower Triassic Piramboia Formation sandstones, Parana Basin, SW Brazil Outcrops of eolian sandstones of the Lower Triassic Piramboia Formation in the eastern margin of the intracratonic Parana Basin are known as the main occurrence of tar sandstones in Brazil because contain heavy oil (""tar""). In order to investigate the migration of oil into the sandstones petrographic analyses of dune facies were performed. Optical (transmitted, reflected and epifluorescence lights) and Field Emission Scanning Electron (FE-SEM) microscope studies together with X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses showed that the Piramboia Formation sandstones have not been affected by intense diagenesis. Eogenetic features includes mainly thin, continuous inherited ferruginous clay coatings and minor mechanically infiltrated clay coatings around detrital mineral grains. The authigenesis of smectite and K-feldspar overgrowths precipitation begin to develop and during shallow mesodiagenesis, authigenic smectite was gradually transformed into mixed-layer illite-smectite; K-feldspar overgrowths, quartz overgrowths continuous to develop, and pore-filling calcite cement were formed locally. In the late mesodiagenesis the emplacement of oil occurred, filling pores and covering grains, clay coatings and calcite. During later surface exposure, water washing by meteoric fluids and biodegradation transformed the oil into a heavy oil rich in asphaltenes. The influx of acid meteoric waters caused dissolution of detrital K-feldspars as well as meteoric waters generate organic acids which also caused the dissolution of K-feldspars and the consequent generation of secondary porosity with the precipitation of inter- and intragranular vermicular kaolinite. However, kaolinite can be also a product of eodiagenetic process similar to the occur in the telodiagenesis. To evaluate the porosity of the sandstones microtomography analysis were preformed revealing high porosity volume (ca. 26%) and high volume of porous with connectivity (ca. 26%). Although not currently commercially exploited nowadays the knowledge of the Piramboia tar sandstones diagenetic evolution contributes for a better understanding of the Parana Basin sedimentary fill during the Lower Triassic.",
2487,"Geothermal systems on the island of Bali, Indonesia This paper presents an overview of the geothermal systems on the island of Bali, Indonesia. Physicochemical data of hot springs and shallow geothermal wells were collected from four geothermal locations: Penebel, Batur, Banjar and Banyuwedang. The concentrations for the three main anions varied significantly indicating a different geothermal history. The values for Cl- ranged from 0.1 to 1000 mg/L, for HCO3- from 20 to 2200 mg/L and for SO42- from 0.1 to 500 mg/L Although the island of Bali is underlain by carbonate rocks, a carbonate host rock for the geothermal reservoirs could not be confirmed, because the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/HCO3- molar ratios were approximately 0.4, well below 1.0 and the K/Mg ratios were approaching those of a calc-alkaline rock reservoir. The HCO3- of the thermal waters correlated with Ca2+, Mg2+, Se+ and K+ indicating water-rock interaction in the presence of carbonic acid. Phase separation was inferred for the Bedugul and Banjar geothermal systems, because of relatively high B/Cl ratios. Boron isotopes were determined for selected samples with values ranging from delta B-11 of 13 to 22.5%. (NBS 951). The heavy delta B-11 of +22.5% together with a low B/Cl ratio indicated seawater input in the Banyuwedang geothermal system. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of the thermal water plotted along the global meteoric water line (GMWL) and close to the mean annual value for precipitation in Jakarta indicating a meteoric origin of the geothermal water. Comparison of the Si, Na/K, Na/K/Ca and Na/Li geothermometers with actual reservoir temperature measurements and physicochemical considerations led to the conclusion that the Na/Li thermometer provided most reliable results for the determination of geothermal reservoir temperatures on Bali. Using this thermometer, the following reservoir temperatures were calculated: (1) Penebel (Bedugul) from 235 to 254 degrees C, (2) Batur 240 degrees C and (3) Banjar 255 degrees C. Due to seawater input this thermometer could not be applied to the Banyuwedang geothermal system. There application of a SiO2 thermometer indicated a reservoir temperature below 100 degrees C.

2488,"Advanced development in upstream of petroleum industry using nanotechnology Nowadays, energy supply is one of the most important issues due to limitation of oil, gas and coal sources. Because of rapid population, civilization and energy consumption growth, the improved technologies to make optimal use of the sources, solving related problems and finding new energy sources are important. More than 10 years ago, nanotechnology as one of the most important technologies has also been applied to progress in the oil and gas industry (upstream, midstream and downstream). The experience of these years has shown that application of nanotechnology in the oil industry improves the exploration of crude oil and natural gas (underground or deep water), drilling and bringing the crude oil or raw natural gas to the surface, as well as transportation, storage, processing and purifying methods. Nanoparticles with high specific surface area, pore volume and small size show unique physical and chemical properties, which could be applied in several applications. In this regard, many researchers have been focused on various nanoparticles for upstream industries and studied their potential in oil exploration, drilling, production and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Also, in downstream and midstream which involve refining of crude oil, processing and purifying of raw natural gas, transportation and storage of crude or refined petroleum products, the nanomaterials have been used to improve the quality of oil and make it appropriate for the environment. Lowering sulfur gasoline, enhancing the octane number and coating the transportation system are among the goals that have been achieved successfully using nanotechnology. In this work, various types of nanoparticles such as metallic, metal oxide, hybrid nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, nano-composites and their applications in oil upstream industry are reviewed. Also, their usage in different types of oil upstream processes is discussed. (C) 2020 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.

The maximum corrosion rate registred during the first 200 h of testing was 0.5 mm/y. These results were confirmed by electrochemical potential measurements and monitoring. The Moessbauer spectra and thermomagnetic analysis of deposits from surfaces of real heat exchangers were obtained. There is an indication of FeS2 (pyrite) and Fe7S8 (pyrolite) as corrosion products in the samples studied, which can be attributed to a SRB activity in the cooling water.",
2490,"Landscape Drivers and Social Dynamics Shaping Microbial Contamination Risk in Three Maya Communities in Southern Belize, Central America Land transformation can have cascading effects on hydrology, water quality, and human users of water resources, with serious implications for human health. An interdisciplinary analysis is presented, whereby remote-sensing data of changing land use and cover are related to surface hydrology and microbial contamination in domestic use areas of three indigenous Maya communities in Belize, Central America. We asked whether a departure from traditional land-use patterns toward intensified use led to consequences for hydrology and microbial contamination of drinking water, and investigated how social factors in the three study communities may act to ameliorate human health risks associated with water contamination. We showed that a departure from traditional land use to more intensive cultivation and grazing led to significantly increased surface water runoff, and intensified microbial contamination of surface water sources sometimes used for drinking. Results further suggested that groundwater contamination was widespread regardless of land cover, due to the widespread presence of pit latrines, pigs, and cows on the landscape, and that human users were consistently subject to health risks from potential pathogens as a result. Given that both surface and groundwater resources were found to be contaminated, it is important that water distribution systems (piped water from tanks; shallow and deep wells) be monitored for Escherichia coli and treated when necessary to reduce or eliminate contaminants and protect public health. Results of interviews suggested that strengthened capacity within the communities to monitor and treat centralized drinking water sources and increase water treatment at the point of use could lead to reduced risk to water consumers.",
2491,"Seasonal effects of rainwater infiltration on volumetric water Content and water quality in mine wastes at the Gyopung mine, South Korea The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of rainwater infiltration on volumetric water content (VWC), groundwater level, and ground and surface water quality in mine waste rock and tailings. The VWC and electrical conductivity was recorded with sensors installed at five depths. Three boreholes 7-13 m in depth were drilled to monitor groundwater level and EC, and to collect water quality samples. During the rainy season, as the water front moved deeper into the tailings. EC values increased. These results and the presence of oxidized and bleached zones in the tailings indicated that soluble salts formed in the vadose zone were migrating downward. Water analyses indicated that the groundwater was contaminated by Zn (282 mg L-1), Cu (59.3 mg L-1), Cd (10.1 mg L-1), and Pb (0.51 mg L-1). All elements were significantly correlated with total dissolved solids (TDS), and correlation coefficients greater than 0.90 were found for Zn-Pb, Zn-Mn, Zn-SO4, Pb-Mn, Cu-Al, Mn-SO4, Al-Si, Na-Mg, and Mg-Ca. It was concluded that 20 cm depth of the soil cover on the tailings was not enough to prevent water infiltration and ground or surface water contamination. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

2492,"Assessment of groundwater quality around municipal solid waste landfill by using Water Quality Index for groundwater resources and multivariate statistical technique: a case study of the landfill site, Qaem Shahr City, Iran Groundwater is a precious natural water resource which can be considered as an available and safe source of water for domestic uses. In some cities in northern Iran, groundwater is being polluted due to various human activities. In this regard, the located municipal solid waste landfills close to these areas without the requested controls regarding the landfill leachate and gas emission are among the major sources of environmental pollution, which are deteriorating groundwater quality around landfill sites. In this context, the current study was aimed to assess the quality of collected groundwater samples around a landfill site using the modified Water Quality Index for groundwater resources (WQIG). Also, the water quality map has been prepared by using WQIG in GIS environment. Therefore, thirty-three groundwater samples were collected and analyzed around 11 water wells close to the landfill site. Variety of physicochemical parameters including nitrate (NO(3)), fecal coliform, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), electrical conductivity, biological oxygen demand (BOD(5)), phosphate (PO(4)), total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, pH were assessed in groundwater samples based on recommended standard methods by American Public Health Association (APHA). Geostatistics analysis including Kriging, semi-variogram, and variogram methods also was used to evaluate the spatial variations in the variables and to provide the necessary data for further interpolation. According to the results of WQIG, most of the groundwater wells (98.85%) are polluted due to the existing of the landfill site in the investigated area. Generally speaking, based on the WQIG the water samples were defined as not suitable for drinking applications. Also, the high concentrations of nitrate and hardness in the downstream wells (W(1)-W(11)) of the landfill were demonstrated by the results of Kriging assay which can be correlated with the penetration of leachate into these wells. Considering the SAR results, all wells in the studied area are classified as (C(3)S(1)) that means the groundwater of this area is suitable for agricultural approaches. Moreover, the reduction in the water quality from the south to the north and northeast was demonstrated by the results of spatial dispersion. Evaluation of the changes in water quality near landfill sites showed that 2149.56Â m(2) of total area had a relatively poor potential for the region's groundwater recharge.",
2493,"Effects of surface modification on heavy metal adsorption performance and stability of peanut shell and its extracts of cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose Effects of surface modification by carboxyl group on Pb2+ adsorption performances and stability of peanut shell and its extracts (cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose) were investigated. Stability of the biosorbents was measured by determining organic compound release amount (TOC). Results showed that adsorption capacity of peanut shell and the extract was poor and stability of them was not good enough. Amount of organic compound released from the unmodified sorbents followed the order: cellulose > lignin > peanut shell > hemicellulose. Hemicellulose was the main organic compound release resource for the raw peanut shell. Due to the poor stability of the raw materials, peanut and its extract could not be used directly in the practical waste water treatment. After modification, adsorption capacity of peanut shell, cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose increased by 4- to 6-folds. Stability of the modified sorbents also increased significantly, and TOC determined for the modified peanut shell, cellulose, and hemicellulose was lower than 4.0 mg L-1 in the optimum pH range from 4.0 to 6.0 even using for 30 days, which was lower than the drinking water standard in China. Modified peanut shell and its extract except for lignin could be used safely in pH ranged from 4.0 to 6.0. Surface modification could improve the adsorption performances and stability of the biosorbents.",
2494,"Schistosomiasis can be prevented A project in Saint Lucia has shown that, as well as preventing gastroenteritis among infants, improved water supplies lead to a reduction in the transmission of schistosomiasis. Furthermore, after the widespread use of antischistosomal drugs, no increase in the prevalence of infection was observed over 4 years in villages with a standpipe water supply, laundries and showers. This project was designed to evaluate 3 methods of combating schistosomiasis--snail control, chemotherapy, and reducing risk of infection by providing safe water. Initially a comprehensive water delivery system, consisting of a water outlet to each house, communal laundries, shower facilities, and play pools for children, was used. Health education induced women to refrain from washing clothes in rivers, and, as a consequence, children accompanying their mothers were less exposed to infected river water; over a 4 year study period the incidence of new Schistosoma mansoni infections among children aged 2-5 years fell from 19.3% to 4.5%. Over the same period in villages served by a standpipe system the incidence fell only very slightly, from 16.5% to 14%. eng",
2495,"Characterization of a thermostable lipase showing loss of secondary structure at ambient temperature A gene encoding extracellular lipase was cloned and characterized from metagenomic DNA extracted from hot spring soil. The recombinant gene was expressed in E. coli and expressed protein was purified to homogeneity using hydrophobic interactions chromatography. The mature polypeptide consists of 388 amino acids with apparent molecular weight of 43 kDa. The enzyme displayed maximum activity at 50 Â°C and pH 9.0. It showed thermal stability up to 40 Â°C without any loss of enzyme activity. Nearly 80% enzyme activity was retained at 50 Â°C even after incubation for 75 min. However above 50 Â°C the enzyme displayed thermal instability. The half life of the enzyme was determined to be 5 min at 60 Â°C. Interestingly the CD spectroscopic study carried out in the temperature range of 25-95 Â°C revealed distortion in solution structure above 35 Â°C. However the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopic study revealed that even with the loss of secondary structure at 35 Â°C and above the tertiary structure was retained. With p-nitrophenyl laurate as a substrate, the enzyme exhibited a K ( m ), V ( max ) and K ( cat ) of 0.73 Â± 0.18 Î¼M, 239 Â± 16 Î¼mol/ml/min and 569 s(-1) respectively. Enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by CuCl(2), HgCl(2) and DEPC but not by PMSF, eserine and SDS. The protein retained significant activity (~70%) with Triton X-100. The enzyme displayed 100% activity in presence of 30% n-Hexane and acetone.",
2496,"Toxic aqueous discharge of iron and sulphur from spoiled coal mined lands and its control by phytostabilization process Toxic aqueous discharge of iron and sulphur due to acid mine drainage causes soil and water pollution. Many countries with unoperating as well as functional mining industries face this problem. In north-eastern India, coal mining has severely degraded much of the agricultural land by impairing soil, plant diversity and water quality. A study was conducted in coal mined out area of Jaintia hills, Meghalaya (northeastern India) to eliminate toxic aqueous discharge (iron and sulphur) and restore the soil fertility of affected land for sustainable crop production. The treatment of acid mine drainage through phytostabilization and soil amendment with agricultural lime and organic manures reduced sulphate from 22 to 5 mg kg(-1) and soluble iron from 476 to 109 mg kg(-1) of surface soil. The soil pH increased by 1.4 unit from its initial value and concentration of plant nutrients like N, P, K and microbial biomass content reached optimum fertility levels. Soluble iron and sulphate in drainage water reduced considerably by 26% and 49% respectively, with concurrent increases in water pH (3.2 to 7.2). Rice grain yield in the mined out area reached about 1320 kg ha(-1) after reclamation as compared 1920 kg ha(-1) in non-mined area. The adaptation of native plant species (Citrus reticulate, Prunus napalensis and Pyrus communis) was about 70%. Afforestation with native fruit plant species and ferns/grasses, soil amendment using lime and organic manure, and channelling of seepage water for checking acid mine drainage contamination of water bodies and crop fields were some of the measures that were effective in mitigating toxicity. Phytostabilization helped in reversing the trend and restoring soil fertility and plant growth due to a rise in soil organic matter, nutrient availability as well as biological activities.",
2497,"Assessment of hydrochemistry and heavy metals pollution in the groundwater of Ardestan mineral exploration area, Iran The aim of this research is to determine the effective factors on the hydrogeochemistry and assessment of heavy metals pollution indices in the groundwater of Ardestan copper exploration area, Iran. In this study, in total, 111 groundwater samples from one well and several qanats and springs were collected. Piper and Stiff diagrams and statistical methods and quality indices were applied to hydrochemical data. Afterward, the water samples were classified into four groups, namely CaHCO3, CaCl, NaCl, and NaHCO3. According to evaluation indices, considering the fact that only a few points are in the high risk level, the groundwater of the study area has a low level of pollution. On the other hand, the pH of the groundwater of the region was mostly neutral and acid mine drainage was not found. Since the condition of the area is in pre-mining process, two factors are possibly influential: (1) rocks or minerals having sulfides are not exposed to an atmosphere (normally below groundwater) and H+ release does not occur and (2) the existence of minerals containing silicate and carbonate that can rapidly reduce acidification of water. Finally, it seems that during mining and in post-mining conditions, acid rock drainage which results from the oxidation of sulfides will probably influence the quality of water resources in Ardestan city. This is because the groundwater flow direction is from the mine toward Ardestan plain.",
2498,"Modeling of trihalomethane (THM) formation via chlorination of the water from Dongjiang River (source water for Hong Kong's drinking water) The Dongjiang River is the major source of drinking water supply for Hong Kong. The deterioration of the water quality of the Dongjiang River and excessive trihalomethanes (THMs) in the tap water of some districts in Hong Kong have become causes for public concern. The main objective of the present study is to investigate and model THM formation due to the chlorination of the Dongjiang River water under different chlorination conditions. The results showed that the total THM formation ranged between 11.7 and 91.8 mg L(-1) and that control of the levels was primarily due to the reaction time and the Br(-) level in the water. Bromide concentration was a key factor in determining bromine-containing THM formation and consequently the speciation of THMs. Higher concentrations of bromide shifted THM species to more-bromine-containing ones, while the kinetics reflected the competing halogenation reactions. As the two mixed-halogen THMs had high cancer potency, the cancer risk of total THMs appeared to reach a peak at a bromide concentration ranging between 218 and 262 mg L(-1) (with a bromide to dissolved organic carbon molar ratio (Br(-)/DOC) ranging between 15 and 18 mM/mM).",
2499,"Isolation and identification of Pseudomonas from wastewater, its immobilization in cellulose biopolymer and performance in degrading Triclosan Triclosan (TCS) is a well-known emerging contaminant got wide use in daily use products of domestic purpose, which provides the way to enter the ecological cycle, and is preferably detected in sewage treatment plants. In this study, TCS degrading bacteria (TDB) was isolated and identified from a wastewater treatment plant at the National Institute of Technology-Karnataka, Surathkal (NITK), India. The isolate was reported as Pseudomonas strain by performing 16S RNA Sequencing using BLAST analysis. Bacterial growth depends upon several environmental factors. Hence its growth optimization was carried out by response surface method (RSM) based central composite design (CCD) and validated by the artificial neural network (ANN). The Parameters or inputs used for optimization are pH, time (days), agitation (rpm) and sorbent dosage (Î¼g/L). Experiments were conducted in batch mode to achieve optimum growth of bacteria based on RSM trial runs. The RSM model predictions were in better agreement with the experimental results and it was confirmed by ANN. The deviation lies within Â±10% with experimental results compared to ANN for maximum trials. Hence optimized parameters were established and arrived at pH - 7, time - 13 days, agitation - 150 rpm, dosage - 1.5 Î¼g/L presented 69% removal of TCS. Minimum inhibitory assay of isolated strain was conducted to identify the degradation capacity of TCS and it was found out to be lesser than 0.025 mg of TCS. Later the strain was immobilized in two different matrices. One is biopolymer extracted from cellulose (Water Hyacinth) along with sodium alginate and second is free bacteria with sodium alginate and was made in the form of beads. The removal of TCS by TDB-cellulose-alginate (BCA) and TDB-Alginate (BA) beads were 58% and 30% respectively. Hence it was concluded that BCA beads showed effective removal compared to BA beads. Therefore, isolate can degrade TCS when the concentration ranges from 0.025 mg/L to 5.5 ng/L.",
2500,"Simulation of a sub-sea gas pipeline in persian gulf to estimate the physical parameters Two-phase gas-liquid flow along pipeline will tend to unavoidable non-stable condition e.g. slugging flow. Slug flow can pose serious problems to the equipments and operator of these flow systems. High fluctuating rates of gas and liquid can severely reduce the production and in the worst case shutdown or damage topside equipments like free water knock out drums. The modelling of two-phase flow systems over recent years become commonplace. This has been a direct result of stringent requirements to adopt the latest technology in health, safety and pipeline integrity analysis. In recent study, the carbon steel sub-sea pipeline with outer diameter 32 inch (ID. 30 inch) in order to transfer sour gas from South Pars gas field to a gas refinery with capacity 2000 MMSCFD for two phases (each phase 1000 MMSCFD) in south of Iran which has approximate length of 87 km is considered to simulate with PIPESIM software based on Beggs & Brill correlation for slug prediction in both vertical and horizontal pipes as well as Peng-Robinson equation of state to estimate gas physical properties. Based on our studies by increasing flow rate the amount of holdup and slug is decreased so that from 200 MMSCFD up to 1000 MMSCFD this value is almost decreased 32% in the riser. In such simulation, care must be taken during the gathering of data for the parameters like pipeline elevation changes, flow and composition of fluids and pipeline operational pressure and ambient temperature.

2501,"Assessing the arsenic-contaminated rice (Oryza sativa) associated children skin lesions The purpose of this study was to assess the potential risk of children skin lesions from arsenic-contaminated rice (Oryza sativa) consumption in West Bengal (India). Published age- and gender-specific skin lesions data in West Bengal were reanalyzed and incorporated into a Weibull dose-response model to predict children skin lesion prevalence. Mono m ethyl arsonous acid (MMA(III)) levels in urine was used as a biomarker that could be predicted from a human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. This study integrated arsenic contents in irrigation water, bioaccumulation factors of paddy soil, cooking methods, and arsenic bioavailability of cooked rice in gastrointestinal tract into a probabilistic risk model. Results indicated that children aged between 13 and 18 years might pose a relative higher potential risk of skin lesions to arsenic-contaminated cooked rice (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.18 (95% CI 1.12-2.15)) than those of 1-6 years children (ORs = 0.98 (0.85-1.40)). This study revealed the need to consider the relationships between cooking method and arsenic in cooked rice when assessing the risk associated with children skin lesions from rice consumption. This study suggested that arsenic-associated skin lesions risk from arsenic-contaminated rice consumption would be reduced significantly by adopting traditional rice cooking method (wash until clean: rice:water = 1:6; discard excess water) as followed in West Bengal (India) and using water containing lower arsenic (e.g., <10 mu g L-1) for cooking.

2502,"Evaluation of drinking water quality using heavy metal pollution indexing models in an agrarian, non-industrialised area of South-East Nigeria The objectives of this study were to evaluate the physicochemical properties of drinking water sources at Ihiala, Nigeria, and to assess the water quality using the heavy metal pollution index, heavy metal evaluation index and contamination index models. Physicochemical parameters like pH, total hardness, total dissolved solids, nitrate, cyanide, residual chlorine and six metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Ni) were analyzed in the water samples, and heavy metal pollution indices computed. The spring and borehole waters had better organoleptic properties compared to stream, river and sachet waters. Total hardness, pH and nitrate were the major nonmetallic contributors to the poor water quality. The mean pollution indices were: heavy metal pollution index (HPI) 143.02 +/- 71.16, heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) 7.53 +/- 4.12 and contamination index (C-d) 1.53 +/- 4.12. Sixty percent of the samples exceeded the critical HPI value of 100. There was significant (P < 0.01) positive correlation between HPI and C-d, HPI and HEI (r = 0.886) and HEI and C-d(r = 1.000). Lead contributed most to heavy metal pollution of water in the region. The quality of most water sources in Ihiala is not good for drinking.",
2503,"Influence of flow rate variations on chemistry change of pumped Disi water to Amman/Jordan: a laboratory simulation approach In order to monitor the change in the Disi water chemistry that is pumped from the Disi aquifer to Amman city along the 345 km pipeline, the changes in chemistry and surface precipitation of scale were investigated using simulated plumbing system. The influence of flow rate variation was investigated since Disi water usually pumped using different flow rates along the pipeline. Disi water was pumped through 20.0 m steel pipes at different flow rates (5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 L/min) with circulation time of 5 h for each run. Water quality parameters, for example, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, calcium, magnesium, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, and total hardness, were determined every hour using standard methods of analysis. The results showed that pipes that transport Disi water suffers from calcium carbonate scale deposition as the water is pumped with different flow rates. It was found that the scale deposition increased by increasing the flow rate and the surface roughness of the metal.",
2504,"Pediatric cryptosporidiosis: An evaluation of health care and societal costs in Peru, Bangladesh and Kenya Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of pediatric diarrhea in resource-limited settings; yet, few studies report the health care costs or societal impacts of this protozoan parasite. Our study examined direct and indirect costs associated with symptomatic cryptosporidiosis in infants younger than 12 months in Kenya, Peru and Bangladesh. Inputs to the economic burden model, such as disease incidence, population size, health care seeking behaviour, hospital costs, travel costs, were extracted from peer-reviewed literature, government documents, and internationally validated statistical tools for each country. Indirect losses (i.e. caregiver income loss, mortality, and growth faltering) were also estimated. Our findings suggest that direct treatment costs per symptomatic cryptosporidiosis episode were highest in Kenya ($59.01), followed by Peru ($23.32), and Bangladesh ($7.62). The total annual economic impacts for the 0-11 month cohorts were highest in Peru ($41.5M; range $0.88-$599.3M), followed by Kenya ($37.4M; range $1.6-$804.5M) and Bangladesh ($9.6M, range $0.28-$91.5M). For all scenarios, indirect societal costs far outweighed direct treatment costs. These results highlight the critical need for innovative improvements to current prevention, diagnostic and treatment strategies available in resource poor settings, as well as the need for solutions that span multiple disciplines including food and water safety, sanitation and livestock production.",
2505,"Hepatitis E virus infection Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection can lead to acute and chronic hepatitis as well as to extrahepatic manifestations such as neurological and renal disease; it is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. Four genotypes are responsible for most infection in humans, of which HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are obligate human pathogens and HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are mostly zoonotic. Until quite recently, HEV was considered to be mainly responsible for epidemics of acute hepatitis in developing regions owing to contamination of drinking water supplies with human faeces. However, HEV is increasingly being recognized as endemic in some developed regions. In this setting, infections occur through zoonotic transmission or contaminated blood products and can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infections can be diagnosed by measuring anti-HEV antibodies, HEV RNA or viral capsid antigen in blood or stool. Although an effective HEV vaccine exists, it is only licensed for use in China. Acute hepatitis E is usually self-limiting and does not require specific treatment. Management of immunocompromised individuals involves lowering the dose of immunosuppressive drugs and/or treatment with the antiviral agent ribavirin.",

Design Secondary data analysis (cross-sectional). Setting West and Central Africa. Participants Data are from the Demographic and Health Surveys in the time period between 1986 and 2016. The final sample included between 116 325 and 272 238 observations depending on the outcome. Primary and secondary outcome measures Nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions were identified based on the UNICEF Conceptual Framework for child undernutrition. These were early breastfeeding initiation, minimum dietary diversity, full age-appropriate immunisation, iodised salt usage, vitamin A supplementation, iron supplementation, deworming in children aged 1 to 5, clean cooking fuel, safe drinking water and improved sanitation. Explanatory variables include household, mother and child characteristics. Linear probability models were fitted for each outcome, both unadjusted as well as fully adjusted including primary sampling unit fixed effects. Results Prevalence of early breastfeeding initiation was 54.31% (95% CI: 53.22% to 55.41%), minimum dietary diversity 13.89% (95% CI: 13.19% to 14.59%), full age-appropriate immunisation 13.04% (95% CI: 12.49% to 13.59%), iodised salt usage 49.66% (95% CI: 46.79% to 52.53%), vitamin A supplementation 52.87% (95% CI: 51.41% to 54.33%), iron supplementation 10.73% (95% CI: 10.07% to 11.39%), deworming 31.33% (95% CI: 30.06% to 32.60%), clean cooking fuel usage 3.02% (95% CI: 2.66% to 3.38%), safe drinking water 57.85% (95% CI: 56.10% to 59.59%) and improved sanitation 42.49% (95% CI: 40.77% to 44.21%). There was a positive education and wealth gradient for the practices of all interventions except deworming. Higher birth order was positively associated with the practice of early breastfeeding initiation, minimum dietary diversity, vitamin A supplementation and negatively associated with full immunisation and improved sanitation. Conclusions Household, maternal, and child-level characteristics explain practices of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions beyond intervention delivery at the regional level.",
2508,"Assessing the changes in groundwater quality around tanneries: the Chennai example (India) A study was carried out with the aim of assessing the groundwater quality with respect to chromium around tanneries in a part of Chennai, southern India. The wastes from these tanneries are treated in the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) and released to open drains that join the Adyar River flowing nearby. Water samples were collected from 22 locations in March 2010 and analysed for chromium content. The chromium concentration in groundwater was compared with the study carried out in 2008. EC ranged from 985 to 5344 mu S/cm and was at permissible levels in only 5.3% of groundwater samples. The chromium concentration ranged from 5 to 35 mu g/L which was within the maximum permissible limit of 50 mu g/L (Bureau of Indian Standards for drinking water quality). A general pattern of high concentration in the northeastern part of the study area was found where the tanning industries and CETP are located. The CETP started functioning in 1995 in this area after stringent rules were imposed to treat the effluent before its disposal. However, before 1995, effluent with high concentration of many ions was released to open drains without proper treatment. In 2008, the chromium concentration in the study area ranged from 4 to 990 mu g/L while EC ranged from 584 to 6690 mu S/cm. Due to the functioning of the CETP, the chromium in groundwater has decreased, as evident from the studies in 2008 and 2010. However, the quality of groundwater based on EC is still poor, which may be because the CETP removes chromium effectively as it is a potentially-toxic heavy metal, rather than decreasing the concentration of all the ions in groundwater. Hence, it is essential to remove the TDS and to frequently monitor the groundwater quality at regular intervals.",
2509,"Geophysical assessment for vertical leachate migration profile and physicochemical study of groundwater around the Olusosun dumpsite Lagos, south-west Nigeria The study was aimed at assessing the vertical movement of leachate from 2001 through 2015, and groundwater physicochemical parameters analysis around the Olusosun dumpsite, through a time-lapse study. Tracking the leachate vertical migration profile was achieved through analysis of VES time-lapse data obtained from previous investigations on the dumpsite between 2001 and 2006, and 2D resistivity data acquired from this study in 2014 and 2015. Seventeen borehole and hand-dug well water samples were obtained randomly from 17 sampling locations around the dumpsite, first, in August 2014 (wet season) and then a repeat in December 2015 (dry season). The results of the VES data and 2D resistivity analysis showed that there is a constant and progressive increase in the depth of migration of the contaminants generated on this site into the subsurface environment over the years. It also showed that the contaminated zones are characterised by resistivity values ranging from 0.63 to 12.5 Omega m, and a maximum depth of 120 m has been impacted by the contaminants. The results of the water sample analysis showed clear variations for the various elemental constituents analysed for. Most of the physicochemical parameters analysed fell within the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) standard limit. Comparing the wet and dry season results, there was generally an increase in the mean concentrations of TDS, EC, temperature, hardness, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+,,, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cr from the dry season study, particularly the samples with close proximity to the dumpsite. On the other hand, there was reduction in the mean concentrations of ,, Fe, pH, and Ni from the dry season study when compared with the wet season. This trend could be attributed to the fact that in the absence of rainfall during the dry season period, contaminant accumulation in groundwater continued undiluted due to continuous breakdown of the biodegradables units with time, and this led to the generally high concentration of the physicochemical properties during the dry season. The implication is that the water around the study area has lower quality in the drier season when compared to the quality of water during the wet season, and so water treatment should be given more priority during the dry season before consumption and usage for other domestic purposes to avoid waterborne diseases. Generally, the information obtained from the geophysical study will facilitate decisions on improving protection for groundwater resources around the study area.",
2510,"Is better drinking water valued in the Latin American countryside? Some evidence from Cotacachi, Ecuador To investigate the financial contribution that rural people might make to the improvement of the potable water systems that serve them, 274 households in Cotacachi in the Ecuadorian Andes were surveyed about payments for watershed conservation, which would reduce seasonal shortages. While monthly payments of $1 or $2 were acceptable to most households, there was little support for payments above $3/month.

Radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA) was used for U-238 determination in all cases. In addition, for data accuracy assessments purposes, a sub-set of these samples was analysed by high-resolution alpha spectrometry, following standard radiochemical separation and purification. Our data show that drinking waters sampled at various settlements located close to the uranium mining sites are characterised by relatively low uranium concentrations (1.9-35.9 mu g L-1) compared to surface waters sampled within the same sites. The latter show high concentrations of total uranium, reflecting the influence from the radioactive waste generated as a result of uranium ore production.",
2512,"UAE, MAE, SFE-CO2 and classical methods for the extraction of Mitragyna speciosa leaves Mitragyna speciosa, a tropical plant indigenous to Southeast Asia, is well known for its psychoactive properties. Its leaves are traditionally chewed by Thai and Malaysian farmers and manual labourers as it causes a numbing, stimulating effect. The present study aims to evaluate alkaloid yield and composition in the leaf extracts. For this purpose we have compared several non-conventional extraction techniques with classic procedures (room temperature or under heating). Dried M. speciosa leaves belonging to three batches of different origin (from Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia) were extracted using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction SFE-CO(2), using methanol, ethanol, water and binary mixtures. The extracts were compared using an HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of mitragynine and four other related alkaloids which were present in the alkaloid fraction. The extraction technique influences both the raw product yield and the relative alkaloid content of M. speciosa leaves. Of the several methods tested, MAE in a closed vessel at 110 Â°C (60 W, methanol/water 1:1) gave the highest alkaloid fraction amount, while UAE with an immersion horn at 25 Â°C (21.4 kHz, 50 W, methanol) showed the best yield for mitragynine. This work may prove to be a useful contribution to forensic, toxicological and pharmacognosy studies. Although the potential applications of M. speciosa alkaloids clearly need further investigation, these results may facilitate the scaling-up of their extraction.",
2513,"Synthesis of maghemite nanoparticles and its application for removal of Titan yellow from aqueous solutions using full factorial design In this paper, batch adsorption experiments were carried out to investigate the maximum adsorption conditions of the anionic dye Titan yellow on maghemite nanoparticles (-Fe2O3). The -Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation method, and the -Fe2O3 nanoparticles structure was performed by transmission electronic microscopy, scanning electron microscope, XRD, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. The prepared magnetic adsorbent was well dispersed in water and easily separated magnetically from the medium after loaded with adsorbate. The main goal of this study was to analyze the role of experimental factors on the removal of Titan yellow from aqueous solution using full factorial design. The main and interactive effects of four most important variables like pH of the solution, dosage of adsorbent, initial concentration of dye, and contact time were investigated through the model equations designed by a two-level full factorial design. The results were statistically analyzed using the analysis of variance to define important experimental factors and their levels. A regression model that considers the significant main and interaction effects was suggested and fitted the experimental data very well. The optimized conditions for dye removal were at initial pH 6.0, 0.35g L-1 of adsorbent, 30.0mg L-1 dye, and 25.0min adsorption time. The adsorption capacity was evaluated using both the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. The maximum predicted adsorption capacities for Titan yellow was obtained as 839.421mgg(-1). Furthermore, the kinetic of Titan yellow adsorption on -Fe2O3 nanoparticles was analyzed using pseudo-first- and second-order kinetic models and the results showed that the removal was mainly a pseudo-second-order process.",
2514,"A possible link between Balkan endemic nephropathy and the leaching of toxic organic compounds from Pliocene lignite by groundwater: preliminary investigation Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a fatal kidney disease that is known to occur only in clusters of villages in alluvial valleys of tributaries of the Danube River in Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bosnia, and Croatia. The confinement of this disease to a specific geographic area has led to speculation that an environmental factor may be involved in the etiology of BEN. Numerous environmental factors have been suggested as causative agents for producing BEN, including toxic metals in drinking water, metal deficiency in soils of BEN areas, and environmental mycotoxins to name a few. These hypotheses have either been disproved or have failed to conclusively demonstrate a connection to the etiology of BEN, or the clustering of BEN villages, in previous work, we observed a distinct geographic relationship between the distribution of Pliocene lignites in the Balkans and BEN villages. We hypothesized that the long-term consumption of well water containing toxic organic compounds derived from the leaching of nearby Pliocene lignites by groundwater was a primary factor in the etiology of BEN. In our current work, chemical analysis using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) spectroscopy indicated a high degree of organic functionality in Pliocene lignite from the Balkans, and suggested that groundwater can readily leach organic matter from these coal beds. Semi-quantitative gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of solvent extracts of groundwater from shallow wells in BEN villages indicated the presence of potentially toxic aromatic compounds, such as napthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene at concentrations in the ppb range. Laboratory leaching of Balkan Pliocene Lignites with distilled water yielded soluble organic matter (> 500 MW) containing large amounts of aromatic structures similar to the simple/discrete aromatic compounds detected in well water from BEN villages. These preliminary results are permissive of our hypothesis and suggest that further work on the possible relationship between the etiology of BEN and toxic aromatic substances leached from Pliocene lignites in well water is warranted.

2515,"Arsenic and iron removal from water using constructed soil filter - a novel approach Arsenic poisoning is a global problem. It is known that groundwater in Bangladesh and West Bengal predominantly contains As(III) and concentrations of Fe(II) which are often too low for removal of arsenic in optimum quantities. To eliminate arsenic from drinking water, several basic methods Such as coagulation, adsorption. ion exchange. filtration. membrane processes, are reported. To deal with this issue on a small to large scale. we present a novel approach to remove arsenic and iron from water by constructed soil filter (CSF). In CSF. As (III) is oxidized to As(V) by media via natural oxidation and subsequently, arsenic is co-precipitated with iron. Here water containing arsenic, iron, and phosphate is passed through the CSF media at the rate of 100 ml/min. Results show a mean residence time of 8.6 min and a holdup of 1.851. Results of six runs show that with initial As(III) of 300 mu g/l and iron concentration of 5-10 mg/l. residual arsenic levels below 10 ppb and residual iron <0.30 mg/l in water can be achieved. In CSF. no chemicals are needed for the oxidation of As(III) to As(V). The oxidation takes place due to the presence of various oxides Such as iron, manganese, aluminum. and the microbial diversity in the media of soil bioreactor. Such a novel technology is also applied for purification of water and wastewater. (C) 2008 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.",
2516,"Construction of Hierarchical alpha-MoO3 Hollow Microspheres and Its High Adsorption Performance towards Organic Dyes Hierarchical semiconducting metal oxide is highly active due to its special stereostructure, which is potential adsorbent for dye contaminants Precursors of MoO2 hollow spheres were successfully synthesized via a simple and one-step solvothermal method. And hierarchical alpha-MoO3 hollow microspheres were obtained after subsequent calcination at 400 degrees C. Diameters of the alpha-MoO3 microspheres were about 600-800 nm which were assembled by nanorods with a width of 70 nm. The as-obtained alpha-MoO3 nanomaterials presented excellent adsorption performance for methylene blue (MB). MB removal percentage attained 73.40% in the first 5 min when the concentration of alpha-MoO3 absorbent was 0.5 g/L in MB solution at the concentration of 20 mg/L. The equilibrium was established after adsorption for 60 min, and the removal percentages stabilized in the range of 97.53%-99.65%. Their adsorption kinetics was well fitted to a pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherm conformed to Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum uptake capacity was 1543.2 mg/g. The alpha-MoO3 microspheres are cost-effective, fast and complete for MB removal owing to its hierarchical and hollow nanostructures, which also can be employed for adsorption of other organic dyes in waste water.",
2517,"Defluoridation of groundwater using raw bauxite: Kinetics and thermodynamics High concentration of fluoride in drinking water causes dental and skeletal fluorosis, a slow, progressive and incurable disease. Removal of fluoride from water (defluoridation) offers a viable remedy to high fluoride content in water and fluorosis where other domestic water treatment solutions are not practicable. Conventional defluoridation technologies are either inefficient or require significant financial and technological investment. Therefore studies in developing countries have focused on local defluoridating agents for abating high fluorides and fluorosis. This study therefore investigated the efficiency of using raw bauxite in defluoridating groundwater through batch equilibrium studies. The bauxite exhibited defluoridation efficiency of up to 96.1% for groundwater with a fluoride concentration of 6.17mg/L at a bauxite dosage of 0.120kg/L. High fluoride uptake capacity of up to 275mg/kg was obtained for the raw bauxite. Gibbsite which is the main constituent of the raw bauxite was responsible for the fluoride removal. The intraparticle diffusion model revealed that fluoride sorption by the raw bauxite occurred through both surface complexation and penetrative diffusion. Ion exchange resulting in the precipitation of insoluble AlF3 might add to the fluoride removal. Fluoride sorption was spontaneous and showed first order kinetics. The activation energy and enthalpy of reaction were determined as 19.6 and 126.5kJ/mol, respectively. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",
2518,"Health risks associated with fluoride intake from rural drinking water supply and inverse mass balance modeling to decipher hydrogeochemical processes in Vattamalaikarai River basin, South India Preliminary investigation reveals that fluorosis is reported due to the continuous intake of fluoride-rich groundwater in Vattamalikarai River basin, Tamil Nadu, India. A detailed study was attempted for evaluating the health risks associated with the intake of fluoride-rich groundwater supplied to the rural community. Groundwater samples were collected from 60 and 58 dug and tube wells during winter and southwest (SW) monsoon seasonsÂ respectively. The samples were analyzed for the determination of fluoride and other chemical parameters to examine the fitness for drinking water. Spatio-temporal variation maps reveal that fluoride concentration is high during SW monsoon season when compared with the winter season in this region. The fluoride bearing minerals present in hornblende-biotite gneiss and charnockite rock formations leached into the groundwater during rock-water interaction. To understand the subsurface hydrogeochemical reactions, inverse mass balance model was developed using NETPATH code. The model output indicates that calcite dilution, silicate (hornblende and biotite) weathering, ion exchange (Ca/Na and Mg/Na) and illite precipitation are the dominant processes controlling the groundwater chemistry along the flow paths. Non-carcinogenic risks to children and adults (women and men) were evaluated by working out intake exposure of groundwater. Hazard quotient (HQ) based on fluoride intake was calculated for children and adults. It varied from 0.08 to 2.21 with an average of 1.07 for adults. For children, it varied from 0.01 to 2.99 with the mean of 1.44. About 78%, 69% and 61% of the samples fall under the risk category for children, women and men during winter season. However, more number of samples possessed health risks (83% of samples for children, 73% of samples for women and 64% of samples for men) during SW monsoon season.",

2520,"Impacts of cycling and walking on health, environment, and society: Pakistan a case in point The existence of automobiles such as cars, trucks, jeeps, buses, and, motorbikes bring ease to our lives and allow us to transport a large number of goods and passengers from one place to another. Due to their reliability and tendency to reduce the commute times, people of today's modern world prefer these transportation modes. However, the excessive use of these fossil-fueled automobiles leaves hazardous impacts on health, environment, and quality of life. Use of fossil fuel-based automobiles leads to increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, elevated levels of air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution and disposal of waste. Moreover, it also raises the risk of traffic accidents and traffic congestion. Furthermore, the reliance on passive modes of transportation removes the physical activity from people's lives. This lack of physical activity causes various physical (cardiac, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, allergies) as well as psychological issues. In order to reduce, if not eliminate, these hazardous impacts on environment and health, use of active transport i.e. cycling and walking is being promoted in developed and developing countries. The research undertaken aims to highlight the impact of cycling and walking on various physical as well as psychological diseases. Moreover, this research also highlights the positive impacts of cycling and walking on various environmental and societal factors. Through this research, health, environmental and societal factors are discussed and ranked using the Fuzzy VIKOR under the influence of various criteria. The outcomes of this research show the positive impacts of cycling and walking on various diseases, environmental and societal factors. Moreover, this research can help formulate a policy which can drive people towards the use of active modes of transportation. It is aimed that through practical implementation of the policies formulated, the rate of various diseases and harmful effects on the environment and society can be reduced.",

2522,"Environmental Fatigue Test of CF8M with a Small Autoclave Simulating PWR Conditions To develop a fatigue design curve of cast stainless steel CF8M used in primary piping material of nuclear power plants, low-cycle fatigue tests have been conducted by Korea Electric Power Research Institute (KEPRI). A small autoclave simulated the environment of a pressurized water reactor (PWR), 15 MPa and 315 degrees C. Fatigue life was measured in terms of the number of cycles with the variation of strain amplitudes at 0.04 %/s strain rate. A small autoclave of 1liter and cylindrical solid fatigue specimens were used for the strain-controlled low cycle environmental fatigue tests to make the experiments convenient. However, it was difficult to install displacement measuring instruments at the target length of the specimens inside the autoclave. To mitigate the difficulty displacement data measured at the shoulders of the specimen were calibrated based on the data relation of the target and shoulder length of the specimen during hot air test conditions. KEPRI developed a test procedure to perform low cycle environmental fatigue tests in the small autoclave. The procedure corrects the cyclic strain hardening effect by performing additional tests in high temperature air condition. KEPRI verified that the corrected test result agreed well with that of finite element method analysis. The process of correcting environmental fatigue data would be useful for producing reliable fatigue curves using a small autoclave simulating the operating conditions of a PWR.",
2523,"Prevention of traveler's diarrhea (emporiatric enteritis). Prophylactic administration of subsalicylate bismuth) The efficacy of a daily dosage regimen of subsalicylate bismuth in preventing or reducing the severity of diarrhea among young healthy adults was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Diarrhea developed in 14 (23%) of 62 students receiving subsalicylate bismuth compared with 40 (61%) of 66 students taking a placebo. The protective effect of subsalicylate bismuth was apparent within a day or two of the study onset and became more obvious as the number of days at risk increased. The students treated with subsalicylate bismuth experienced fewer intestinal complaints and were less likely to pass soft or watery stools of any number. Once diarrhea occurred, enteropathogens were less commonly identified in stools of students receiving subsalicylate bismuth (33%) compared with placebo (71%). Subsalicylate bismuth was well tolerated by students during the 21-day trial.",
2524,"Layered double hydroxide of Cd-Al/C for the Mineralization and De-coloration of Dyes in Solar and Visible Light Exposure Cd-Al/C layered double hydroxide (Cd-Al/C-LDH) and Cd-Sb/C nanocatalyst are reported here for the decoloration and mineralization of organic dyes. These catalysts were largely characterized by FESEM, EDS, XRD, FTIR, XPS, PL and DRS. The diffuse reflectance data showed a band gap at 2.92 and 2.983 eV for Cd-Al/C-LDH and Cd-Sb/C respectively. The band gap suggested that both catalysts work well in visible range. The photoluminescence spectra indicated a peak at 623 nm for both the catalysts which further support the effectiveness of the respective catalyst in visible range. Both catalysts also showed good recyclability and durability till 4th cycle. Five dyes, acridine orange (AO), malachite green (MG), crystal violet (CV), congo red (CR) and methyl orange (MO) were used in this experiment. Various parameters of different light intensity such as visible, ultraviolet, sunlight and dark condition are observed for the de-coloration of these dyes. The de-coloration phenomenon was proceeded through adsorption assisted phot-degradation. The low cost, abundant nature, good recyclability and better dye removal efficiency make these catalysts suitable candidates for the de-coloration and mineralization of organic dyes.",
2525,"Uptake and Accumulation of Triclosan in Cyperus articulatus L. Planted in a Constructed Wetland for the Treatment of Domestic Wastewater Triclosan (TCS) is a halogenated aromatic compound used in household products such as toothpaste, detergents, soaps, and cosmetics, and is frequently found in domestic wastewater. The harmful effects of TCS are associated with hormonal and metabolic alterations in aquatic organisms. The present study evaluated the Phyto-purifying capacity of Cyperus articulatus L. planted in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland used for domestic wastewater treatment. This required the usage of a 0.8 m x 0.5 m and 0.85 m high artificial wetland in fiberglass and polyester resin filled with garden gravel to a depth of 0.4 m, which received a daily flow of 18 L from a storage tank for 4 months. The concentration of TCS in influent and effluent water, as well as in plant roots and stems, was determined by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. The TCS removal efficiency was 63% and was lower than that reported in similar studies. The translocation factor (TF) and bio-concentration factor (BCF) reached values of 1 and 0.06, respectively, indicating that C. articulatus can absorb and transport TCS from the root to higher parts of the stem. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that a local plant such as C. articulatus planted in constructed wetlands can decrease the concentration of an emerging pollutant, such as TCS, from domestic wastewater.",
2526,"Kutz Siphon Failure: How to Shut Down Memorial Day Weekend A 17.5 foot diameter prestressed concrete pipe (PCCP) pipe failed in the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project (NIIP), Farmington, New Mexico, on May 2016. This pipe, installed in 1972, featured double-wire wrap with a 16-gauge steel liner. Electromagnetic (EM) inspections showed an increase from 30 wire breaks in 2003 to 60 breaks in 2010 in one section of the pipe. In 2016, the pipe ruptured and blew concrete 100 to 200 feet away, with debris damaging an overhead powerline. Approximately 75,000 acres of irrigated land were without irrigation service, so water was rationed to priority crops. Emergency repairs were a high priority. Reclamation's Four Corners Construction Office partnered with the Navajo Nation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs for emergency repair and replacement. Emergency actions included shutting down interstate highways to transport 17-foot wide loads on Memorial Day weekend. Service was restored within 30 days. This paper covers failure modes, economic and other losses, coordination, steps needed for emergency repair, and recommended remedial actions.",
2527,"Present-day in situ stress prediction in Bozi 3 deep sandstone reservoir, Kuqa Depression: implications for gas development Resources, including petroleum and natural gas, from deep and ultra-deep reservoirs have become an important contributor to global reserve growth and deliverability construction. Knowledge of the present-day in situ stress field has significant applications for efficient exploration and development. The Bozi 3 deep sandstone reservoir is important for increasing natural gas production in the Kuqa Depression. However, little attention has been given to the present-day in situ stress state of the Bozi 3 Block. In this study, the in situ stress orientation and magnitudes were investigated based on stress indicator interpretation, well log calculation, and geomechanical modeling. Drilling-induced tensile fractures and borehole breakouts indicated a dominant NW-SE direction for the horizontal maximum principal stress (S-Hmax) in the Bozi 3 deep sandstone reservoir. The stress regime for the Bozi 3 Block indicates a dominant strike-slip faulting type (S-Hmax >= S-v >= S-hmin). Numerical simulation of the present-day in situ stresses showed that the S-Hmax and horizontal minimum principal stress (S-hmin) magnitudes were - 150 similar to-178 MPa and - 121 similar to-157 MPa in the Cretaceous, respectively. Natural fractures are generally stable in the present-day stress field. When the specific gravity reaches 2.15, approximately 75% of all natural fractures are reactivated. Under the present-day stress state in the Bozi 3 Block, new horizontal wells should be drilled with ENE-WSW-trending. The results for the present-day in situ stress state are expected to provide geological and engineering references for deep gas production in the Bozi 3 Block of Kuqa Depression.U",
2528,"Risk factors for hospital admission of Brazilian children with non-rotavirus diarrhoea: a case control-study Background: Rotavirus has been the leading cause of severe cases of acute diarrhoea (AD) among children worldwide; however, in the same areas, a large reduction in AD related to rotavirus has been observed after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. In Brazil, where there is a high rotavirus vaccine coverage, AD caused by pathogens other than rotavirus is still a frequent cause of outpatient visits and hospitalisations among children under 5 years. Methods: A hospital-based case-control study enrolled children aged 4 to 24 months admitted to 10 hospitals from all five Brazilian Regions. Cases (n=1178) were children admitted with diarrhoea who tested negative for rotavirus in a stool sample. Controls (n=2515) were children admitted without diarrhoea, frequency matched to cases by sex and age group. We estimated odds ratios using logistic regression, in a hierarchical approach according to a previously defined conceptual framework. Population-attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated for each variable, each block and for all significant variables in the latter model adjusted. Results: The factors studied accounted for 41% of the non-rotavirus AD hospital admissions and the main risk factors included lack of adequate excreta disposal (PAF=12%), untreated drinking water (PAF=11%) and a history of previous hospitalization due to AD (PAF=21%). Low socio-economic conditions, no public water supply, crowding and low weight-for-age made smaller contributions. Conclusions: These findings further our knowledge of risk factors associated with severe AD in the post-rotavirus vaccination era. We recommend further increase in coverage of basic sanitation, improvements in water quality and further expansion of primary healthcare coverage to reduce the occurrence of non-rotavirus severe diarrhoea and subsequent hospitalization of Brazilian children.",
2529,"Calibrating Mid-Permian to Early Triassic Khuff sequences with orbital clocks The Middle East Geologic Time Scale (ME GTS) seeks to document and age-calibrate Arabian Plate transgressive-regressive (T-R) depositional sequences using: (1) Geological Time Scale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (GTS), and (2) Arabian Orbital Stratigraphy time scale (AROS). AROS is based on an orbital-forcing glacio-eustatic model that offers three orbital clocks to date T-R sequences: (1) Stratons @ ca. 405 Ky; (2) Dozons @ ca. 4.86 My (12 stratons); and Orbitons @ ca. 14.58 My (36 stratons, three dozons). The Earth today is in Orbiton 0, which started ca. 1.5 Ma (SB 0); the ages of lower boundaries of orbitons can be estimated with the formula SB n = n x 14.58 + 1.5 Ma. This scheme was used to calibrate the Arabian Plate's Mid-Permian to Early Triassic Khuff sequences, which contain one of the largest gas-bearing carbonate reservoirs in the World. The Khuff and equivalent formations have been interpreted by several authors in terms of six long-period sequences in outcrop belts and subsurface sections (Khuff sequences KS6 to KS1 in ascending order). Their type sections are briefly reviewed with emphasis on their boundaries, higher-order architecture and stage assignments. The age calibration starts at the basal Khuff Sequence Boundary (Khuff SB, Sub-Khuff Unconformity) defined in a type section in Al Huqf outcrop in Oman. Above the Khuff SB (ca. 268.9 Ma) the type sections of the oldest Khuff sequences KS6 (ca. 268.9-264.0 Ma) and KS5 (ca. 264.0-259.1 Ma) are defined in Oman and interpreted to each consist of twelve subsequences (stratons) with the predicted architecture of two consecutive dozons. By biostratigraphy they span the Mid-Permian (Guadalupian Epoch), Wordian and Capitanian stages. Type-Sequence KS4 (ca. 259.1-254.2 Ma) is defined in Iran and corresponds to the Wuchiapingian Stage. The Iranian type-Khuff Sequence KS3 (ca. 254.2-249.4 Ma) contains nine subsequences (stratons) grouped between two major exposure surfaces. By correlation to the Changhsingian Stage and Permian/Triassic Boundary (PTrB) type section in South China, it is interpreted as a dozon with three missing stratons. Khuff Sequence KS2 (ca. 249.4-247.8 Ma) contains the PTrB with an orbital age of ca. 249.0 Ma, compared to 251.0 +/- 0.4 in GTS and 249.0-253.0 Ma by radiometric dating in its type section. Khuff sequences KS2 and KS1 contain 13 subsequences (stratons) between ca. 249.4-244.1 Ma spanning latest Permian and Early Triassic. The boundary of the Khuff with the overlying Sudair Formation, Sudair Sequence Boundary, is defined in Borehole SHD-1 (Central Saudi Arabia) and calibrated at ca. 244.1 Ma falling near the age of the Early/Mid-Triassic Boundary in GTS. The enclosed Chart shows a work-in-progress correlation of the six Khuff sequences across the Arabian Plate.",

2531,"RISK-FACTORS ASSESSMENT FOR TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI-RHODESIENSE SLEEPING SICKNESS ACQUISITION IN SE UGANDA - A CASE-CONTROL STUDY The major risk factors associated with acquisition of T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness in the Busoga focus, S.E. Uganda, were investigated using a case-control study. 122 cases and 244 matched controls were used in the study. For each case two age-, sex- and residence controls (1 matched nearest neighbour control and 1 village control) were selected. Patients and controls answered the same questionnaire which had been developed and field tested before and the field study started. A logistic regression model for a 1:2 matched case control design was fit to the data. The following factors were found significant: cases spent more time outside their village of residence than controls and visited more SS high risk areas than controls, more cases than controls collected firewood in the forests. Generally, cases had less domestic animals grazing near the places of man-fly contact, especially near water and firewood collecting and bathing points, and near farms and gardens, than controls. Cases had more antecedents of sleeping sickenss in the family. Generally cases had a less well developed information network than controls, and belonged economically to a less powerful group. Based on these results we may conclude that the risk to develop T.b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness depends upon a multitude of economical, cultural and human behaviour factors. These factors should be taken into account in the planning and monitoring of sleeping sickness control programmes.",
2532,"Technique for arsenic removal from groundwater utilizing geological options - an innovative low cost remediation High arsenic levels in groundwater have emerged as a nagging problem in recent decades in different parts of the world. The high arsenic groundwater of the Holocene aquifers of the alluvial terrain of the Bengal Delta Plain (BDP) is unique and elusive in the extent of its exposure causing a threat to the lives of more than 70 million people. The present paper deals with the utilization of the indigenous geological material, laterite (or red earth) for removing arsenic from groundwater and potable water supplies. The aim is to devise a low cost arsenic filter unit using laterite. The material has been manipulated in several ways to study its applicability as an effective arsenic adsorbent. The results exhibit a removal efficiency of >90% and therefore can be implemented as an effective arsenic filter unit. Cost analysis shows that production of 10 l of water containing arsenic concentration as per WHO guidelines will cost US$ 0.625.",
2533,"Concentration of Uranium Radioisotopes in Albanian Drinking Waters Measured by Alpha Spectrometry Uranium is a radioactive material that is frequently found in rocks and soil When uranium decays, it changes into different elements that are also radioactive, including radon, a gas that is known to cause a lung cancer. The main concern with uranium in drinking water is harm to the kidneys Public water systems are required to keep uranium levels at or below 500 mBq per liter to protect against kidney damage. Such an interest is needed due to safety, regulatory compliance and disposal issue for uranium in the environment since uranium is included as an obligatory controlled radionuclide in the European Legislation (Directive 98/83 CE of Council of 03.11.1998). The aim of this work is to measure the levels of uranium in drinking and drilled well waters in Albania At first each sample was measured for total Alpha and total Beta activity. The samples with the highest levels of total alpha activity were chosen for the determination of uranium radioisotopes by alpha spectrometry. A radiochemical procedure using extraction with TBP (Tri-Butyl-Phosphate) is used in the presence of U-232 as a yield tracer. Thin sources for alpha spectrometry are prepared by electrodepositing on to stainless steel discs The results of the U-238 activity measured in the different samples, depending from their geological origin range between 0.55 - 13.87 mBq/I. All samples measured results under the European Directive limits for U 238 (5-500 mBq/I), Dose Coefficients according to Directive 96/29 EURATOM",
2534,"Comparative Study on the Reservoir Characteristics and Development Technologies of Two Typical Karst Weathering-Crust Carbonate Gas Reservoirs in China Carbonate reservoirs are the main reservoir types in China, which occupy the large ratio of reserves and production at present. The high-efficiency development of carbonate reservoirs is of great significance to assure the stability of national energy supply. The Lower Paleozoic reservoir in Jingbian gas field and the Sinian reservoir in Anyue gas field are two typical carbonate gas reservoirs, and their successful development experiences can provide significant references for other similar carbonate gas reservoirs. For Jingbian gas field, it is a lithological-stratigraphic reservoir developed in a westward monocline and multiple rows of nose-fold structures, and is a stable craton basin with simple palaeognomy distribution and stable connectivity, which has complex gas-water distribution. However, for Anyue gas field, it is a lithological-structural reservoir with multiple tectonic high points and multiple fault systems, and is biological dune beach facies under extensional setting with highly differentiated inside of the block in palaeognomy characteristics, which has limited connectivity and tectonic side water is in a local area. The difference of gas reservoir characteristics leads to the diverse development strategies. For these two gas reservoirs, although there are some similar aspects, such as the screen of enrichment areas, the application of irregular well pattern and reservoir stimulation techniques, the criteria of enrichment areas, the well types, and the means of reservoir stimulation are absolutely different. In addition, due to the differences of control reserves and production capacity for these two kinds of reservoirs, the mode of stable production is also different. The effective development of Jingbian gas field can give some references to the future exploitation on the Sinian gas reservoir. Firstly, the sedimentary characteristics should be studied comprehensively. Secondly, the distribution pattern and distribution characteristics of the palaeognomy should be found and determined. Thirdly, the distribution of fracture system in the reservoir should be depicted finely. Finally, dynamic monitoring on the production performance should be strengthened, and the management for this gas field should be improved further. The findings of this study can help for better understanding of the Karst weathering-crust carbonate gas reservoir formation characteristics and the optimal development technologies that should be taken in practice.",
2535,"Tectonic and radioactivity impacts of U-238 on groundwater-based drinking water at Gosa and Lugbe areas of Abuja, North Central Nigeria Tectonic contribution of activity level of U-238 in groundwater-based drinking water in Gosa and Lugbe areas of Abuja was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest activity level of 2736 mu Bq L-1 reported in Lugbe borehole, whereas the lowest value of 443 mu Bq L-1 reported at Gosa borehole. The inhabitants permanently used water from the boreholes for daily consumption. The group receives 5.55 x 10(-5) mSv of the annual collective effective dose due to U-238 in drinking water. The radiological risks of U-238 in the water samples were found to be low, typically in magnitude of 10(-7) with cancer mortality value of 1.03 x 10(-7) and morbidity value of 1.57 x 10(-7). The chemical toxicity risk of U-238 in drinking water over a lifetime consumption has a mean value of 4.0 x 10(-3) g kg(-1) day(-1). It could be that the human risk due to U-238 content in groundwater supplies from ingestion may likely be the chemical toxicity of U-238 as a heavy metal rather than radiological risk. Significantly, Lugbe subsurface may have developed some fractions of granitic strata that contributed to the distribution of radioactive of U-238 in tectonically weak zones.",
2536,"The preparation of organophosphorus ligand-modified SBA-15 for effective adsorption of Congo red and Reactive red 2 P,P-bis (2-oxooxazolidin-3-yl)-N-(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)phosphinic amide (APTES-BOP)-modified SBA-15 (SBA-15-BOP) was prepared by a post-synthesis grafting method for the removal of anionic azo dyes from aqueous solutions. The properties of the prepared adsorbent were characterized by PXRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, nitrogen sorption, and elemental analysis. Adsorption equilibrium and adsorption kinetic studies demonstrated that the experimental data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model. According to Langmuir fitting, SBA-15-BOP showed high adsorption capacity for CR and RR2 dyes, with the maximum adsorption capacities of 518.1 mg g(-1) and 253.8 mg g(-1), respectively. The thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption processes of CR and RR2 dyes on SBA-15-BOP were spontaneous and exothermal. The prepared SBA-15-BOP can be a promising adsorbent for the removal of anionic dyes from aqueous solutions.",
2537,"Monitoring of fluoride in water samples using a smartphone In several parts of India, groundwater is the only reliable, year round source for drinking water. Prevention of fluorosis, a chronic disease resulting from excess intake of fluoride, requires the screening of all groundwater sources for fluoride in endemic areas. In this paper, the authors present a field deployable colorimetric analyzer based on an inexpensive smartphone embedded with digital camera for taking photograph of the colored solution as well as an easy-fit, and compact sample chamber (Akvo Caddisfly). Phones marketed by different smartphone makers were used. Commercially available zirconium xylenol orange reagent was used for determining fluoride concentration. A software program was developed to use with the phone for recording and analyzing the RGB color of the picture. Linear range for fluoride estimation was 0-2mgl(-1). Around 200 samples, which consisted of laboratory prepared as well as field samples collected from different locations in Karnataka, India, were tested with Akvo Caddisfly. The results showed a significant positive correlation between Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) method and Akvo Caddisfly (Phones A, B and C), with correlation coefficient ranging between 0.9952 and 1.000. In addition, there was no significant difference in the mean fluoride content values between ISE and Phone B and C except for Phone A. Thus the smartphone method is economical and suited for groundwater fluoride analysis in the field.",
2538,"[Synergistic effects by P and N pollution to fluctuation behavior/bloom of algae along the Three-Gorges valley] Absorption rate coefficient of algae omega(i) to nutrients such as N and P could be used for describing algal increases/decreases velocity in water areas in theory. omega(i) raise might correspond to algal quickly growth and to ccelerate absorption of N and P while omega(i) decrease might correspond to algal decompose and release of N and P. According to locale measuring data along the Three-Gorges valley and algal dynamics model of nutritious absorption we have obtained some interest 3-dimension figures in which omega(i) will varies up and down obviously with N and P concentration in special bound to show a synergistic effects of N and P that might reveal an inner behavior of algal bloom/decompose. The research results explain in reason: (1) algal blooms do will happen in one special P/N range in a certain water system; (2) when omega(1) and omega(2) ascend rapidly and simultaneously in positive direction at same time algae would bloom, and when omega(1) and omega(2) descend sharply and simultaneously in negative direction at same time algae would decompose; (3) The velocity of algal bloom is not only same approximately as one of algal decompose, but also its variety has evidently periodic fluctuation. All of these could reveal effectively mechanism of nutritious absorption/release as algal bloom/decompose.",
2539,"The impact of labor-saving technology on first birth intervals in rural Ethiopia Across the developing world labor-saving technologies introduce considerable savings in the time and energy that women allocate to work. Hormonal studies on natural fertility populations indicate that such a reduction in energetic expenditure (rather than improved nutritional status alone) can lead to increased ovarian function. Other qualitative studies have highlighted a link between labor-saving technology and behavioral changes affecting subsequent age at marriage, which may affect fertility. This biodemographic study was designed to investigate whether these physiological and behavioral changes affect fertility at a population level by focusing on a recent water development scheme in Southern Ethiopia. The demographic consequences of a reduction in women's workload following the installation of water points, specifically the variation in length of first birth interval (time lapsed between marriage and first birth), are investigated. First birth interval length is closely associated with lifetime fertility in populations that do not practice contraception, longer intervals being associated with lower fertility. Using life tables and multivariate hazard modeling techniques a number of significant predictors of first birth interval length are identified. Covariates such as age at marriage, season of marriage, village ecology, and access to improved water supply have significant effects on variation in first birth intervals. When entered into models as a time-varying covariate, access to a water tap stand is associated with an immediate reduction in length of first birth intervals.",

2541,"Development of a health education intervention strategy using an implementation research method to control taeniasis and cysticercosis in Burkina Faso Background: Taeniasis and cysticercosis are two diseases caused by Taenia solium, a parasite transmitted between humans and pigs, leading to considerable economic loss and disabilities. Transmission of the parasite is linked to environmental and behavioural factors such as inadequate sanitation and hygiene, poor pig management, and consumption of infected pork. This study used implementation research method to design a health education intervention strategy for reducing T. solium infections in Burkina Faso, a country endemic for the parasite. Methods: Eighteen group discussions were conducted with 8-18 participants each in three villages. In addition, structured interviews were conducted among 4 777 participants and 2 244 pig owners, who were selected through cluster random sampling in 60 villages of three provinces of Burkina Faso. Both approaches assessed knowledge and practices related to T. solium. The information obtained was used to develop a community-adapted health education intervention strategy to control taeniasis and cysticercosis in Burkina Faso. Results: The group discussions revealed that participants had a poor quality of life due to the diseases as well as inadequate access to latrines, safe water, and healthcare services. In addition, it was found that pig production was an important economic activity, especially for women. Furthermore, financial and knowledge constraints were important limitations to improved pig management and latrine construction. The survey data also showed that open defecation and drinking unboiled water were common behaviours, enhanced by a lack of knowledge regarding the transmission of the parasite, perceived financial barriers to the implementation of control measures, lack of public sensitization, as well as a lack of self-efficacy towards control of the parasite. Nevertheless, the perceived financial benefits of controlling porcine cysticercosis could be emphasized by an education program that discourages open defecation and encourages drinking safe water. The final intervention strategy included a Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) approach, as well as a 52-min film and an accompanying comic booklet. Conclusions: The main problem in the study communities regarding the transmission of T. solium cysticercosis is the random disposal of human faeces, which can be contaminated with parasite eggs. Prevention of open defecation requires the building of latrines, which can be quite problematic in economically challenged settings. Providing the community with the skills to construct durable latrines using low-cost locally available materials would likely help to resolve this problem. Further studies are required to implement and evaluate the T. solium control strategy developed in this study.",
2542,Facile Electrodeposition of MoOx onto Gold Microwire Electrode: Application to Voltammetric Determination of As(III) under Mild Conditions Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) was electrochemically deposited onto the surface of a Au microwire electrode in a simple manner. The MoOx-Au microwire electrode exhibited effective and sensitive determination of As(III) under mild conditions. No obvious interference from Cu(II) on the determination of As(III) was observed since the response of Cu(II) appeared at a more positive potential.,
2543,"Impact of waste dump on surface water quality and aquatic insect diversity of Deepor Beel (Ramsar site), Assam, North-east India Water and aquatic insects were collected seasonally from site 1, the low-lying area of the dump near Deepor Beel, and from sites 2 and 3 of the main wetland and analysed. While dissolved oxygen (DO) increased from site 1 to site 3 in each season, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solid (TDS), total alkalinity (TA) and free CO(2) (F-CO(2)) decreased. Pb and Cd were found to exceed the limits set for drinking water in all the sites and seasons. Species richness (SpR) was found highest (23) at site 2 and lowest (14) at site 1. Sensitive species was absent. The Shannon (H') values at site 1 were <Â 1 while at sites 2 and 3 were >Â 1 in most of the seasons. Biological monitoring scores (Biological Monitoring Working Party and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number-Average Level) in different sites and seasons inferred severely poor to moderate water quality. At site 1, significant negative correlations were seen for Pb and Cr with SpR while Ni and Cu with insect density (ID). At site 2, TA had highly significant positive correlations with SpR and ID while Cu showed negative correlation with SpR. At site 3, ID had significant negative relationships with air temperature, water temperature, depth, TA, F-CO(2), PO(4)(3-) and Cr. Canonical correspondence analysis triplot has clearly separated site 1 associated with tolerant species and highly influenced by TA, TDS, EC, F-CO(2,) Cr, Ni, Cd and Zn confirming high anthropogenic activities on that site. Tolerant and semitolerant species were present at site 2 (influenced by depth and transparency) and site 3 (influenced by Pb and WT) both. Results of this study discerned that the dump site is the point source of pollution.",
2544,"Analyzing crop yield gaps and their causes using cropping systems modelling-A case study of the Punjab rice-wheat system, Pakistan Pakistan faces significant future challenges to feed a growing population, with 47% of the population currently categorised as food insecure. The rice-wheat (RW) zone of Punjab is the major aromatic rice producing area of Pakistan. Here the rice-wheat cropping rotation is practiced over a variety of soils under a range of agronomic and irrigation practices. It is important to quantify and understand the existing crop yield gaps and associated factors in this zone to identify opportunities for gap-reduction leading to increased land and water productivity and sustainable water use in Pakistan. The APSIM model was parameterised for local soils and climate, and then calibrated for rice and wheat growth, phenology and yields using experimental data sets. The model calibration was then validated using 5-year (2009-2014) farmer grain yield records from each of the highest (Gujranwala) and lowest (Narowal) performing districts in Punjab, before being used to simulate long-term (34 years) rice wheat yields for current farmer practices and also for potential (no water or N-stress) production, in both districts. The revealed yield gaps were further assessed as a function of sowing date. Observed and simulated farmer R-W yields for Gujranwala were greater than those for Narowal; however potential yields were similar at both sites (for both rice and wheat). Farmers currently achieve only around 36% (Narowal) to 67% (Gujranwala) of potential yield for rice, and 48-56% of potential for wheat (Narowal and Gujranwala respectively). The modelling analysis of abiotic stresses under which the farmers' crops were grown revealed that nitrogen (N) deficiency was the primary driver for the large yield gaps at both sites, for both crops, with low topsoil carbon (0.19% Narowal; 0.49% Gujranwala). The simulated farmer crops were not significantly constrained by water limitations under the current N application rates, or by high/low temperatures. Gaining a better understanding of farmers' reasons for low N-rates is important it could be related to (non-modelled) soil micronutrient constraints or risk aversion associated with irrigation water supply reliability. Current sowing dates are also problematic for the existing varieties, with optimum rice sowing dates being up to one month later than the current ones, yet optimum wheat sowing dates being a month (or more) earlier than current ones. This wicked problem points towards the need for further investigations into system optimisation, with better nutrient management, increased soil carbon levels, and shorter season high-yielding rice varieties likely to be key elements.",
2545,"Operationalizing Integrated Water Resource Management in Latin America: Insights from Application of the Freshwater Health Index Water crises in Latin America are more a consequence of poor management than resource scarcity. Addressing water management issues through better coordination, identification of problems and solutions, and agreement on common objectives to operationalize integrated water resources management (IWRM) could greatly improve water governance in the region. Composite indices have great potential to help overcome capacity and information challenges while supporting better IWRM. We applied one such index, the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) in three river basins in Latin America (Alto Mayo, PerÃº; BogotÃ¡, Colombia; and Guandu, Brazil) to assess freshwater ecosystem vitality, ecosystem services, and the water governance system in place. The approach included convening management agencies, water utilities, planning authorities, local NGOs and industries, community groups and researchers to co-implement the FHI. The results provide detailed information on the ecological integrity of each basin and the sustainability of the ecosystem services being provided. All three basins show very low scores for governance and stakeholder engagement, thus improving both in the region should be a priority. The results also shed light on how the FHI framework can help inform decision-making to improve IWRM implementation by facilitating stakeholder engagement while contributing to coordination, identification of problems and solutions as well as agreement on common objectives. Because implementation of IWRM is part of the solution for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.5 (""By 2030, implement IWRM at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate""), our case studies can serve as examples to other Latin American countries to achieve SDG 6.5.",
2546,"Low-cost laterite-laden household filters for removing arsenic from groundwater in Vietnam and waste management This study evaluated the performance of a low-cost natural laterite from Thach That (NLTT), Vietnam, for its capacity to remove arsenic (As) in a household filter with contaminated groundwater. The NLTT was initially tested in a laboratory column trial lasting 800 h. The breakthrough curves were found to fit the Thomas model very satisfactorily with adsorption capacities of 0.06 and 0.20 mg/g at a flow velocity of 0.85 m/h for the influent As(V) concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. In household filters at four sites, the median As concentration in groundwaters (0.04-0.19 mg/L) dropped to 0.026-0.054 mg/L after traditional sand filtration. However, following subsequent NLTT filtration through columns (14 cm inner diameter, 65 cm height) at 0.65 m/h flow velocity, it fell to below the Vietnam and WHO drinking water standard (0.01 mg/L) during seven months of continuous operation. Portland cement and lime were tested as binding agents for the exhausted NLTT waste in a solidification/stabilization process at different ratios. The best ratio of exhausted NLTT: Portland cement: lime for restraining mobility of As from this waste was 3:1:0.5. The concrete brick products exhibited a suitable compressive strength for using it as building materials in construction work. (c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

2547,"2-D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) Assessment of Ground Failure in Urban Area This study was carried out to assess the foundation defects around an urban area in Selangor, Malaysia using 2-D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The affected structure is a three storey houses and having severe foundation-based cracks. Six 2-D ERT survey lines with 5 m minimum electrode spacing using Pole-dipole array were executed parallel to building's wall. Four boreholes were conducted to identify the depth to competent layer to verify the 2-D ERT results. Inversion model of 2-D resistivity show that the study area consists of two main zones. The first zone is a low resistivity value (<100 Omega m), which appears to be a zone that is fully saturated with sandy silt and this could be an influence factor the increasing water level because sandy silt is highly permeable in nature and alluvium (silt, sand and clay), boulder (1200-3500 Omega m) or highly weathered with the resistivity values of 100-1000 Omega m at 20-70 m depth. The second zone is the granite bedrock of more than 3500 Omega m with depth greater than 70 m. These results were complimented and confirmed by borehole records. The ERT and borehole record suggest that the clay, sand, saturated zone, highly weathered zone and boulders at foundation depths may lead to ground movements which affected the stability of the building.",
2548,"Advanced NPPs based on modular lead-bismuth cooled fast reactors Today's nuclear power (NP) is in the state of an intrinsic conflict between economic and safety requirements. This fact makes difficult its sustainable development. One of the ways of finding the solution to the problem can be use of modular fast reactors (FR) cooled by lead-bismuth coolant (LBC) that has been mastered in conditions of operating reactors of Russian nuclear submarines. Based on this experience, the small power FR for multi-purpose usage (SVBR-75/100) has been developed for use both in developed countries - the large power modular units of 1400 â‹¯ 1800 MWe - and in developing countries - the medium and small size power-complexes of 100 â‹¯ 600 MWe for producing electricity, heat, and sea water desalination. The inherent safety properties are peculiar to reactor SVBR-75/100 due to the physical features of small power FRs (âˆ¼ 100 MWe) i.e chemical inertness, high boiling point of LBC, integral design of the pool type primary circuit equipment. This makes it possible to eliminate deterministically the number of severe accidents such as prompt neutrons reactor runaway, coolant loss, chemical explosions and fires caused by primary circuit's tightness failure, destruction of the reactor vessel caused by internal pressure, to eliminate core melting in case of blacking out the NPP for about 5 days. Due to the small power of the reactor, the whole reactor is possible to be fabricated at the factory and be delivered to the NPP site in practical readiness by using any kind of transport including the railway. All safety systems operate passively, most are used as normal operating systems. The results of carried out works have revealed that the period of constructing the two-unit modular NPP with unit's power being 1600 MWe (16 reactors SVBR-75/100) can be âˆ¼ 3,5 years under specific capital costs being 660 $/kWe (Russian costs and conditions). Reactor installation (RI) SVBR-75/100 was designed in compliance with a conservative approach. This approach presumes to use to the maximal extent the technical solutions and temperature parameters, which have already been verified by operating experience. Further, when a one-through steam-generator producing super-heated steam is used, technical and economical parameters will be considerably improved. Nuclear power based on these reactors can successfully compete with steam-gas heat power plants not only at the liberalized power market but at the investment market as well. Reactor SVBR-75/100 can operate in different fuel cycles and use different kinds of fuel (UO2, MOX, TRUOX, UN, PuN+UN). In this case if MOX fuel is used, core breeding ratio (CBR) slightly exceeds 1 and if mixed nitride fuel is used, CBR=1,13 without side breeding zones. Due to the hard neutron spectrum typical for this reactor, the reactor is possible to be used as a burner of minor actinides extracted out of spent fuel of light water reactors.",

2550,"The effects of improved sanitation on diarrheal prevalence, incidence, and duration in children under five in the SNNPR State, Ethiopia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial Background: Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death, killing 1.3 million in 2013 across the globe, of whom, 0.59 million were children under 5 years of age. Globally, about 1 billion people practice open defecation, and an estimated 2.4 billion people were living without improved sanitation facilities in 2015. Much of the previous research investigating the effect of improved sanitation has been based on observational studies. Recent studies have executed a cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of improved sanitation. However, none of these recent studies achieved a sufficient level of latrine coverage. Without universal or at least a sufficient level of latrine coverage, a determination of the effect of improved latrines on the prevention of diarrheal disease is difficult. This cluster-randomized trial aims to explore the net effect of improved latrines on diarrheal prevalence and incidence in children under five and to investigate the effect on the diarrheal duration. Method/design: A phase-in and factorial design will be used for the study. The intervention for improving latrines will be implemented in an intervention arm during the first phase, and the comparable intervention will be performed in the control arm during the second phase. During the second phase, a water pipe will be connected to the gotts (villages) in the intervention arm. After the second phase is completed, the control group will undergo the intervention of receiving a water pipe connection. For diarrheal prevalence, five rounds of surveying will be conducted at the household level. The first four rounds will be carried out in the first phase to explore the effect of improved latrines, and the last one, in the second phase to examine the combined effects of improved water and sanitation. For documentation of diarrheal incidence and duration, the mother or caregiver will record the diarrheal episodes of her youngest child on the ""Sanitation Calendar"" every day. Of 212 gotts in the project area, 48 gotts were selected for the trial, and 1200 households with a child under 5 will be registered for the intervention or control arm. Informed consent from 1200 households will be obtained from the mother or caregiver in written form. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the second study to assess the effects of improved latrines on child diarrheal reduction through the application of Community-Led Total Sanitation.",
2551,"Assessing the hydrogeochemistry and water quality of the Aji-Chay River, northwest of Iran Aji-Chay River is one of the most important surface reservoirs of northwest of Iran, because it passes through Tabriz city and discharges to Urmia Lake, one of the largest permanent salty lakes in the world. The main objectives of the present study are to evaluate its overall water quality and to explore its hydrogeochemical characteristics, including the potential contamination from heavy metals and metalloids such as Co, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Cr, Al and As. For this purpose, 12 water samples were collected from the main river body and its tributaries within Tabriz plain. The Piper diagram classified water samples mainly into Na-Cl and secondary into Ca-HCO3 and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl types, denoting a profound salinization effect. The cross-plots showed that natural geochemical processes including dissolution of minerals (e.g., carbonates, evaporites and silicates), as well as ion exchange, are the predominant factors that contribute to fluvial hydrogeochemistry, while anthropogenic activities (industrial and agricultural) impose supplementary effects. Cluster analysis classified samples into two distinct clusters; samples of cluster B appear to have elevated electrical conductivity (EC) values and trace metals concentrations such as Co, Pb and Cd, while SiO2 and Zn are low in comparison with the samples of the cluster A. The main processes controlling Aji-Chay River hydrogeochemistry and water quality were identified to be salinization and rock weathering. Both are related with geogenic sources which enrich river system with elevated values of Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, SO42- and EC as a direct effect of evaporites leaching and elevated values of Pb and Cd as an impact from the weathering process of volcanic formations. According to the US salinity diagram, all of the water samples are unsuitable for irrigation as having moderate to bad quality.",
2552,"Iron isotope evidence for arsenic mobilization in shallow multi-level alluvial aquifers of Jianghan Plain, central China Intake of groundwater with arsenic (As) concentrations exceeding the World Health Organization standard of 10Â Î¼gÂ L(-1) adversely impacts over 100 million people worldwide. Geogenic As contaminated groundwater within central Yangtze River Basin has recently been reported, but the variations within different depths of aquifers are not commonly observed and the processes controlling As variations have yet to be resolved. Here we report the significant As variations within two different depths (10Â m and 25Â m) of shallow multi-level alluvial aquifers at Jianghan Plain, a floodplain in the central Yangtze River Basin, which is also a recently discovered geogenic As affected area with cases of waterborne arsenicosis. The multi-year monitoring of aquifer chemistry results show that the As concentrations increase with the Fe(II) concentrations when As contents are relatively lower (<200Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)) in upper phreatic aquitard (at 10Â m depth), while decrease with Fe(II) concentrations when As contents are much greater in lower confined aquifer (at 25Â m depth), and the highest is up to 1070Â Î¼gÂ L(-1). Iron isotope analysis were conducive to characterize Fe cycling in the aquifers and thus illustrate geochemical processes controlling As mobilization of shallow groundwaters. Results showed that groundwater is generally enriched in isotopically light Fe with Î´(56)Fe values between - 1.60â€° and + 0.06â€° (median - 0.55â€°). In the upper phreatic aquitard, microbial reductive dissolution of As-associated Fe(III) oxides, hydroxides and oxyhydroxides is the major process controlling As concentrations lower than 200Â Î¼gÂ L(-1). The reduction process could lead to the increasing As concentrations with the gradually increasing Î´(56)Fe values, and a positive correlation between Fe andÂ Î´(56)Fe, and between dissolved As and Î´(56)Fe values is observed, respectively. In strongly reducing conditions as the lower confined aquifer, jointly microbial reduction of sulfate promotes the As mobilization through HS(-) abiotic reduction of Fe(III) minerals, resulting in As concentrations greater than 200Â Î¼gÂ L(-1). These findings could provide new insights for differentiating the major factors controlling As mobilization at different depths of aquifers, and provide better water managements for similar geogenic As-affected shallow alluvial aquifers.",
2553,"Trends of actual and potential evapotranspiration based on Bouchet's complementary concept in a cold and arid steppe site of Northeastern Asia Due to complex natural water flux processes and the ambiguous explanation of Bouchet's complementary theory, site-level investigations on evapotranspiration (ET) and related climate variables assist in understanding the regional hydrological response to climate change. In this study, site specific empirical parameters were incorporated in the Bouchet's complementary relationship (CR) and potential and actual ET were estimated by CR method and subsequently validated by 6 years of ground-based vapor flux observations. Time series analysis, correlation analysis and principal regression analysis were conducted to reveal the characteristics of climate change and the controlling factor(s) of the variations of potential ET and actual ET. The results show that this region is exhibiting a combined warming and drying trend over the past decades with two change points that occurred in 1993 and in 2000. Potential ET was predominantly influenced by temperature and vapor pressure deficit, while actual ET was mostly influenced by vegetation activity. Potential ET was found to be increasing concurrently with declining actual ET to constitute nearly a symmetric complementary relationship over the past decades. This study help to enhance our understanding of the regional hydrological response to climate change. Further studies are needed to partition the actual ET into transpiration and other components and to reveal the role of vegetation activity in determining regional ET as well as water balance.",
2554,"Association between arsenic exposure and a measure of subclinical sensory neuropathy in Bangladesh OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between arsenic exposure and peripheral neuropathy in Bangladesh, where the population has been chronically exposed to arsenic in drinking water. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 137 subjects derived from a larger cohort. Exposure measures included individual water arsenic concentration, cumulative arsenic index, and urinary arsenic concentration taken at two time points (2001 and 2003). The primary outcome measurement was elevated vibrotactile threshold, as measured by a vibration sensitivity tester (Vibratron II). RESULTS: Arsenic exposure was associated with elevated toe vibration threshold (TVT). Specifically, cumulative arsenic index and urinary arsenic (2001) were both significantly associated with elevated TVT (P = 0.02 and P = 0.009, respectively) after adjustment for age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: Increased arsenic exposure, as measured by both cumulative and urinary measures, was associated with evidence of subclinical sensory neuropathy.",
2555,"Evaluating the sustainability of methods for mitigation of arsenic contaminated aquifers Fresh water is a precious, non-renewable resource that is depleting rapidly in countries such as India, China, and even in the U.S. where rivers are drying up and water table levels are decreasing. To obtain safe drinking water, two direct means are available. These include: (1) treatment of the water as it leaves the pumps (from the tube wells), and (2) application of in-situ geochemical aquifer intervention procedures designed to control and mitigate arsenic pollution. By reducing the concentrations to levels below the critical levels, the risk of arsenic poisoning of the people using the groundwater resource will be minimized or eliminated and thus ensuring the sustainability of groundwater for drinking purposes.",
2556,"Assessment of occupational radiation exposure in underground artisanal gold mines in Tongo, Upper East Region of Ghana Assessments of radon and gamma radiation levels were carried out in underground artisanal gold mines in Tongo. This is one of the numerous artisanal gold mining communities in Ghana. Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs) were used to estimate the mean (222)Rn concentration and dose rates during the Harmattan season (November 2010 to February 2011). The values for the (222)Rn concentration at each monitoring site ranged from 14 Â± 4 Bq m(-3) to 270 Â± 9 Bq m(-3), with a mean value of 98 Bq m(-3).

2557,"Shared flowering phenology, insect pests, and pathogens among wild, weedy, and cultivated rice in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam: implications for transgenic rice Many varieties of transgenic rice are under development in countries where wild and weedy relatives co-occur with the crop. To evaluate possible risks associated with pollen-mediated transgene dispersal, we conducted a two-year survey in Vietnam to examine overlapping flowering periods of rice (Oryza sativa L.), weedy rice (O. sativa), and wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.), all of which are inter-fertile. We surveyed populations in two regions of the Mekong Delta, northern and southern, and at three sites in each of three habitats per region: fresh water, saline water, and acid sulfate soil. Weedy rice frequently flowered simultaneously with neighboring cultivated rice plants. Flowering was more seasonal in wild rice and often peaked in November and December. Peak flowering times of wild rice overlapped with adjacent rice fields at all of the saline sites and half of the acid sulfate sites. The longer flowering season of wild rice ensured that crop-to-wild gene flow was possible in fresh water habitats as well. Our second objective was to determine whether wild and weedy rice populations are exposed to pests that could be targeted by future transgenes, which may then provide fitness benefits. These populations shared many pathogen and insect herbivore species with cultivated rice (leaffolder, locust, cricket, planthoppers, rice bug, stem borer, sheath blight, blast, bacterial leaf blight, and brown spot). Damage by leaffolders and locusts was the most frequently observed insect feeding damage on all three rice types. Indicator species analysis revealed that most of the insect herbivores were associated with particular habitats, demonstrating the importance of broad geographic sampling for transgenic rice risk assessment. These survey data and the strong likelihood of gene flow from cultivated rice suggest that further studies are needed to examine the effects of transgenic traits such as resistance to pests on the abundance of wild and weedy rice.",
2558,"Novel risk factors for primary prevention of oesophageal carcinoma: a case-control study from Sri Lanka Background:Oesophageal carcinoma (OC) is one of the leading cancers in Sri Lanka. Its increasing incidence despite the implementation of various preventive activities addressing the conventional risk factors indicates the possibility of the existence of novel, country-specific risk factors. Thus, the identification of novel risk factors of OC specific to Sri Lanka is crucial for implementation of primary prevention activities. A case-control study was conducted among 49 incident cases of OC recruited from the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama using a non-probability sampling method, and unmatched hospital controls (n = 196) excluded of having OC recruited from the endoscopy unit of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire. Risk factors for OC were assessed by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The risk factors were adjusted for possible confounding by logistic regression analysis. Of the study population, OC was common among males (69%) and the majority presented with squamous cell carcinoma (65%) at late stages (Stage IV: 45%; Stage III: 37%). Following adjusting for confounders, the risk factor profile for OC included; age > 65 years (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.2-14.2); family history of cancer (OR = 5.04; 95% CI: 1.3-19.0); sub-optimal consumption of dietary fibre (OR = 3.58; 95% CI: 1.1-12.3); sub-optimal consumption of anti-oxidants (OR = 7.0; 95% CI: 2.2-22.5); over-consumption of deep fried food (OR = 6.68; 95% CI:2.0-22.6); 'high risk' alcohol drinking (OR = 11.7; 95% CI: 2.8-49.4); betel quid chewing (OR = 6.1; 95% CI: 2.0, 20.0); 'low' lifetime total sports and exercise activities (MET hours/week/year) (OR = 5.83; 95% CI: 1.5-23.0); agrochemicals exposure (OR = 6.57; 95% CI: 1.4-30.3); pipe-borne drinking water (OR = 5.62; 95% CI:1.7-18.9) and radiation exposure (OR = 4.64; 95% CI: 1.4-15.5). Significant effect modifications were seen between betel quid chewing and male sex (p = 0.01) and between ever exposure to radiation and age over 65 years (p = 0.04). Conclusions:Risk profile for OC includes novel yet modifiable risk factors in relation to diet, occupation, environment and health. Primary prevention should target these to combat OC in Sri Lanka.",
2559,"Speciation of arsenic in tube-well water samples collected from West Bengal, India, by high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry The objective of this study was to report on the arsenic species present in tube-well water samples collected from West Bengal, India, especially dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), whose existence has not been reported in the literature. The water samples were collected from Jalangi Gram Panchayet (Murshidabad district, West Bengal, India). The samples were speciated for arsenic 11 days after collection. The samples were collected in duplicate. One part was acidified with nitric acid (final concentration 0.1%), whereas the other part was left unacidified. A quick and highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICPMS) technique was employed for the separation and detection of the arsenic species. Four arsenic species, namely arsenite farsenic(III)], DMA, MMA and arsenate [arsenic(V)l were separated and analysed in less than 5 min. Total arsenic concentration was determined by flow injection (FI)-ICPMS. Most of the samples were found to contain low concentrations of DMA and MMA (<2.1 ppb) and high concentrations of inorganic arsenic (>300 ppb). The existence of DMA and MMA in both acidified and unacidified water samples and in similar concentrations suggests that their presence is natural and not due to acidification. The detection limit of the four arsenic species was 0.06-0.10 ppb. The method was validated by spike recovery and analysis of two water standard reference materials (SRMs). The percentage recoveries of added spikes of all four species were 97-112%. The total arsenic concentration obtained by FI-ICPMS and the sum of the four arsenic species obtained by HPLC-ICPMS for the two water SRMs agreed with the certified values. Moreover, the difference between the total arsenic and the sum of the four arsenic species for most of the water samples was less than 10%. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",
2560,"Geochemical characteristics of the lower part of Shayi Member in Lixian Slope, Raoyang Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, Northern China: Implications for organic matters origin, thermal maturity and depositional environment The lower part of Shayi Member (Es1x Sub-Member) composed mainly of dark mudstones and shales is the dominant source rocks for the Lixian Slope. Based on organic petrology, organic and inorganic geochemistry analyses of several mudstone and shale samples selected from Es1x Sub-Member, this research provides an overview on type, origin and thermal maturity of organic matters, as well as depositional environment of Es1x Sub-Member. Kerogen microscopy observation shows that the macerals are dominated by sapropelinite with a significant mixture of vitrinite and inertinite, indicating that aquatic algal-bacterial organic matter inputs are dominate with a significant contribution of terrigenous organic matter inputs. This statement is supported by n-alkane patterns distribution characteristics, high (n-C-21 + n-C-22)/(n-C-28 + n-C-29) values (average = 1.77), the plot of high Ph/n-C-18 values (average = 4.15) versus low Pr/n-C-17 values (average = 1.13), and high proportion of C-27 sterane and C-29 sterane (average = 37.7 and 42.0%, respectively). In addition, the rather low Pr/Ph values (average = 0.38), high gammacerane index values (average = 0.30), high V/Ni and V/(V + Ni) values (average = 11.84 and 0.89, respectively), high Sr/Ba and Sr/Cu values (average = 8.54 and 108, respectively), indicative of a saline water condition and a anoxic depositional environment. The low C29 sterane alpha alpha alpha 20S/(20S + 20R), C-29 sterane alpha beta beta/(alpha beta beta + alpha alpha alpha), C-31 homohopane 22S/(22S + 22R), C-32 homohopane 22S/(22S + 22R), Ts/(Ts + Tm) values and relatively high moretane/hopane values show that the level of thermal maturity of organic matters in Es1x Sub-Member are low.",
2561,"Synthesis and characterization of a series of cross-linked polyamines for removal of Erichrome Black T from aqueous solution A new series of polymers comprising four terpolymers was synthesized via Mannich polycondensation of benzene-1,4-diamine, formaldehyde and piperazine by varying the benzene-1,4-diamine and piperazine ratio. The new polyamines (labeled Dipip) were characterized using C-13 solid-state NMR, FT-IR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM and EDX. The adsorptive performances of the synthesized polymers for Erichrome Black T (EBT) uptake from aqueous solution were investigated under batch process. Equilibrium, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies were conducted to determine the influence of different operational parameters of the adsorption process. The two most promising polymers among the series show an excellent EBT removal efficiency of similar to 100% and similar to 95% with high adsorption capacities of 775 mg.g(-1) and 917 mg.g(-1), respectively at a meager dosage of 5 mg. The sorption of EBT on the polymers was well described by Redlich-Peterson & Langmuir model while the kinetic studies indicate that pseudo-second order model was followed. For the thermodynamic studies, the negative Delta G and positive Delta H values obtained suggest a spontaneity of the sorption process which was endothermic in nature. The results of reusability test of the resins were promising even at the fourth cycle, showcasing the potentials of the new polymers in dyes contaminated water treatment.

2562,"Profiling of seasonal variation in and cancer risk assessment of benzo(a)pyrene and heavy metals in drinking water from Kirkuk city, Iraq Water samples at 13 sites were analyzed to evaluate heavy metals (cobalt, lead, manganese, copper) and benzo(a)pyrene using 2 methods of analysis (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits). The Lesser Zap River is the main tributary of the Tigris and is used as a main source of drinking water in Kirkuk city through the General Kirkuk project. Risk evaluation for benzo(a)pyrene and lead in water samples was accomplished by Monte Carlo simulation. The highest concentrations of B(a)P were recorded at sites S7 and S5, with levels of 0.192 and 0.122Â ÂµgÂ L(-1) detected by HPLC and ELISA, respectively. The WHO guidelines for benzo[a]pyrene in drinking water recommend 0.7Â ÂµgÂ L (-1), and none of the samples surpassed this level; moreover, B(a)P levels exceeded EPA standards in 2014 (0.01Â ÂµgÂ L(-1)), particularly when the liquid-liquid extraction method with HPLC was used. Carcinogenic risks for human adults and children exist and are highest during the rainy season as compared with the carcinogenic risk during the dry season and risks for children exceed those of adults. This indicates that the 2(nd) round of sampling (winter season) harbors more carcinogenic risk than the 1(st) round of sampling (dry season).",
2563,"Prospective cohort study of respiratory effects at ages 14 to 26 following early life exposure to arsenic in drinking water BACKGROUND: We previously reported chronic respiratory effects in children who were then 7-17 years of age in Matlab, Bangladesh. One group of children had been exposed to high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water in utero and early childhood (average 436 Âµg/L), and the other group of children were never known to have been exposed to >10 Âµg/L. The exposed children, both males and females, had marked increases in chronic respiratory symptoms. METHODS: The current study involves a further follow-up of these children now 14-26 years of age with 463 located and agreeing to participate. They were interviewed for respiratory symptoms and lung function was measured. Data were collected on smoking, body mass index (BMI), and number of rooms in the house as a measure of socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Respiratory effects were still present in males but not females. In the high exposure group (>400 Âµg/L in early life) the odds ratio (OR) among male participants for dry cough in the last 12 months was 2.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21, 4.63, P = 0.006) and for asthma OR = 2.51 (95% CI = 1.19, 5.29, P = 0.008). Forced vital capacity (FVC) was reduced in males in the early life high-exposure group compared with those never exposed (-95ml, P = 0.04), but not in female participants. CONCLUSIONS: By the age range 14-26, there was little remaining evidence of chronic respiratory effects in females but pronounced effects persisted in males. Mechanisms for the marked male female differences warrant further investigation along with further follow-up to see if respiratory effects continue in males.",
2564,"Composition and Abundance Changes of Invertebrates in Biological Activated Carbon (BAC) Filters Biological Activated Carbon Filter (BACF) could provide ideal habitats for invertebrates, which may leads to aesthetic problems and adverse health effects on drinking water. The invertebrates in BACF in a water plant of south China have been studied from Sep. 2006 to Sep. 2007. 23 species (genera or group) of invertebrates were found. The Dominating organism group was rotifer, others included Copepoda, Cladocera, Oligochaeta, Nauplii and Nematoda. The average density of invertebrates in collected filtrate was 6.8 times as many as that in main ozonation water. After BAC filters were used for 13 months, the density of invertebrates in the filtrate, the carbon layer and the BACF collecting main increased by 3 similar to 17 times. There were abundant invertebrates in carbon layers, in which the maximum value up to 52645 ind./kg. Water temperature (WT) is a important factor of affecting the growth of invertebrates in BAC filters. These results indicate that a complex food chain may establishes and result in potential risk of invertebrates to the safety of drinking water in BAC filter.",
2565,"[Distribution Characteristics and Health Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Surface Water Around Electroplating Factories] To investigate the distribution characteristics and the human health risks of heavy metals in surface water samples, 30 samples were collected around electroplating factories of Machong, Shatian, Humen, Changan and Dalingshan towns in Dongguan city, 8 heavy metals(As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) contents were measured and analyzed by using multivariate statistical analysis method and human health risk assessment model. The results showed that the maximum concentrations of Cr, Pb and the average concentration of Hg exceeded Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water(GB 3838-2002, Grade â…¢), the concentrations of Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Zn and Pb during rainy season were all higher than that those during dry season. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn mainly originated from the contaminated electroplating factories, Pb and Hg were mainly affected by the traffic sources, and As was significantly correlated with natural sources. Health risk assessment result of surface water indicated that heavy metal pollution would lead to high health risks especially for children, and the health risks of heavy metals through drinking pathway were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the values caused by dermal contact pathway. Moreover, carcinogenic risks caused by Cr and As were higher than the maximum allowance levels (5Ã—10(-5) a(-1)), and non-carcinogenic risks of the heavy metals (10(-10)-10(-7) a(-1)) decreased in the order of Pb > Ni > Cu > Hg > Zn, which were 4-5 orders of magnitude lower than the maximum allowance levels.",
2566,"Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium Levels in Biological Samples of Pakistani Myocardial Infarction Patients at Different Stages as Related to Controls Background: Many studies have examined the association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and the intake of essential micronutrients (potassium (K(+)), calcium (Ca(2+)), magnesium (Mg(2+)), and sodium (Na(+))). They may separately reduce the CVD incidence to a small degree over the short term levels. The aim of the present study was to compare the levels of micronutrients in biological samples (whole blood, urine, and scalp hair) of myocardial infarction (MI) patients of both genders where ages ranged from 45 to 60 years at first, second and third heart attack (n = 232). For comparison purposes, healthy age-matched referent subjects (n = 103) and patients with cardiovascular without MI, of both genders were also selected. Methods: The elemental concentrations in scalp hair and whole blood were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer prior to microwave-induced acid digestion. The validity and accuracy was checked by means of certified reference materials. Results: The results of this study showed that the mean values of K(+) and Mg(2+) were significantly reduced, while the Na(+) level was higher in blood and scalp hair samples of MI patients as com-pared to control subjects of both genders (p < 0.05). The levels of Ca(2+) in the biological samples of MI patients were found to be higher than in referents, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.05). The urinary levels of these elements were found to be higher in MI patients than in the age-matched healthy controls. Conclusions: Although these data do not prove a causal relationship, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that deficiency and efficiency of some essential micronutrients may play a role in the development of heart disease. The micronutrient supplements containing K(+) and Mg(2+) may be beneficial, but because of potential risks, use should be carefully monitored and restricted to men taking potassium-losing diuretics.

2568,"Interactive Influence of N6AMT1 and As3MT Genetic Variations on Arsenic Metabolism in the Population of Inner Mongolia, China Chronic arsenic exposure via drinking water has become a worldwide public health concern. In humans, inorganic arsenic (iAs) is metabolized to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) mainly mediated by arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (As3MT). We reported recently that N-6 adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase 1 (N6AMT1) was involved in arsenic metabolism, and examined its interactive effect with As3MT on arsenic metabolism in vitro To further evaluate the interactive effect of N6AMT1 and As3MT on arsenic biomethylation in humans, we conducted a human population-based study including 289 subjects living in rural villages in Inner Mongolia, China, and assessed their urinary arsenic metabolites profiles in relation to genetic polymorphisms and haplotypes of N6AMT1 and As3MT Five N6AMT1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs1003671, rs7282257, rs2065266, rs2738966, rs2248501) and the N6AMT1 haplotype 2_GGCCAT were significantly associated with the percentage of iAs (% iAs) in urine (e.g., for rs7282257, mean was 9.62% for TT, 6.73% for AA). Rs1003671 was also in a significant relationship with urinary MMA and DMA (the mean of %MMA was 24.95% for GA, 31.69% for GG; the mean of % DMA was 69.21% for GA, 59.82% for GG). The combined effect of N6AMT1 haplotype 2_GGCCAT and As3MT haplotype 2_GCAC showed consistence with the additive significance of each haplotype on % iAs: the mean was 5.47% and 9.36% for carriers with both and null haplotypes, respectively. Overall, we showed that N6AMT1 genetic polymorphisms were associated with arsenic biomethylation in the Chinese population, and its interaction with As3MT was observed in specific haplotype combinations.",
2569,"Geochemical processes controlling the groundwater transport of contaminants released by a dump in an arid region of Mexico The Vado Carranza dump, located in the Mexicali Valley, Baja California, northwest Mexico, was operated for more than 15 years receiving about 30 tons/day of solid wastes. The disposed wastes were periodically burned in open air. The presence of a shallow aquifer in the area makes the groundwater vulnerable to contamination processes. The purpose of this study was the evaluation of heavy metals content (Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn) in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of this dump. The results indicate high content of metals in soil, mainly at a superficial level, with the highest concentrations in the areas where burning of wastes occurred. Elevated concentrations of cadmium and copper were detected in groundwater with the highest concentrations occurring in monitoring wells located in the north side of the dump, downward of groundwater flow. Although the high content of metals in soil can be attributed to the burning of waste, other sources of pollution could be the agricultural irrigation in the vicinity of the dump. The program PHREEQC was used to model the geochemical evolution of groundwater. Results suggest that evaporation of the contaminated waters circulating below the landfill is one of the key processes that explain the increased concentration of contaminants in groundwater and its seasonal variations. As groundwater flows away from the dump, evaporation can concentrate the chemicals making the water more toxic. These results are important because they illustrate processes that are likely to occur in landfills located in other desert areas of the world.",
2570,"Co-seismic response of water level in the Jingle well (China) associated with the Gorkha Nepal (Mw 7.8) earthquake Changes in co-seismic water levels associated with the Gorkha Nepal earthquake (25 April 2015, Mw 7.8) were recorded in the Jingle well in Shanxi Province China (longitude E112.03 degrees, latitude N38.35 degrees, about 2769 km from epicenter). Based on the observed water levels, we clearly identified signals relating to P, S and surface waves. However, the water temperature recorded at a depth of 350 m shows no co-seismic changes. A spectrum analysis of co-seismic variations of water level shows that the oscillation frequency and amplitude of water level in the borehole are determined by the natural frequency of the borehole, which is not associated with the propagation of seismic waves. The borehole-aquifer system shows a large amplification associated with ground vibrations generated by earthquakes. Considering the local hydro-geological map and the temperature gradient of the Jingle well, a large volume ""groundwater reservoir"" model can be used to explain these processes. Due to seismic wave propagation, the volume of a well-confined aquifer expands and contracts forming fractures that change the water flow. In the well-confined aquifer, water levels oscillate simultaneously with high amplitude ground shaking during earthquakes. However, the water in the center of the ""underground reservoir"" remains relatively stationary, without any changes in the water temperature. In addition, a possible precursor wave is recorded in the water level at the Jingle well prior to the Gorkha earthquake. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

2572,"Precipitation variability in northwest Africa and the connection with large-scale atmospheric circulation and synoptic activity The present study deals with the relation between the spatial and temporal precipitation variability in northwest Africa and the large-scale atmospheric circulation and synoptic activity. Emphasis is put on a better, regionally differentiated understanding of the physical mechanisms of precipitation generation, which are analysed separately for tropically and extratropically induced rainfalls. With the examination of variations in the atmospheric branch of the water cycle, the present study contributes to the interdisciplinary research project IMPETUS (An integrated approach to the efficient management of scarce water resources in West Africa), which investigates changes of the hydrological cycle in two selected river catchments in West Africa and their socio-economic implications. The investigations for the extratropically dominated wintertime are mainly carried out with the help of composite and correlation studies based on monthly data. In addition, a routine for the identification of the axes of upper-level troughs is presented. Three regions with different precipitation regimes are distinguished, whose deviations are mainly caused by the orography. The precipitation in the northern and western parts of Morocco reveals a clear dependence on the strength and position of the North Atlantic storm track (represented by baroclinicity, storm track intensity, frequency of surface cyclones). Rainy synoptic situations are often accompanied by an upper-level trough and/or an additional shallow cyclone west of the Iberian Peninsula as well as predominantly westerly weather types and water vapour advection from the Atlantic Ocean. In this area, a strong negative correlation to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is observed, particularly, when the subtropical NAO-centre is at a relatively eastern position. The region close to the Mediterranean coast in northeast Morocco/northwest Algeria reveals a distinct relation to the frequency of upper-level troughs and the storm track and cyclone activity over the western Mediterranean, that is accompanied by enhanced moisture transports from northwesterly or northerly directions. The region south of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and Algeria is affected by extratropically induced precipitation only in cases of far southward stretching upper-level troughs and/or surface cyclones, that lead to a humidity advection from the Atlantic Ocean along the southern flank of the Atlas. In these cases precipitation often appears to be connected to orographic lifting. The spring precipitation in all three regions shows a weakly negative, temporally variable correlation to the El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation. Particularly in the region south of the Atlas, precipitation in connection with tropical-extratropical interactions is observed throughout the year, especially in the transition seasons. These rainfalls account for up to 40% of the annual precipitation. The typical synoptic evolution and involved physical mechanisms of such tropically induced rainfalls were analysed by investigating in total 12 rainy episodes in late summer/early autumn. Results demonstrate that a moisture input from convective clusters or squall lines over tropical Africa and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean, which is transported to northwest Africa on the eastern side of a subtropical upperlevel trough, is a decisive factor. The involved tropical convection is often triggered by African Easterly Waves. The considered cases show similarities to so called Â«tropical plumesÂ» and Â«Soudano-Saharan depressionsÂ». The precipitation over northwest Africa is predominantly triggered by upper-level divergence ahead of the trough and/or by surface heating of elevated terrain in the Atlas Mountains. The attribution of rainfall to tropical or extratropical sources is done on the basis of the origin of mid-level trajectories that reach the Atlas region. The relations found in this analysis are used to explain different aspects of the spatial, seasonal, interannual and decadal precipitation variations and for the evaluation of the output from ransient climate change experiment with the coupled general circulation model ECHAM4/OPYC3. The results suggest that the predicted northward shift of the entire storm track system over the North Atlantic due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions implies a reduction of winter precipitation in the northern and western parts of Morocco. In particular for the region south of the Atlas, a regionalization of the climate change impacts appears to be necessary to determine future precipitation conditions.",
2573,"Treatment of Sewage Sludge Using Anaerobic Digestion in Malaysia: Current State and Challenges Anaerobic digestion is widely considered as an environmentally friendly technology for various organic waste including sewage sludge. Although the implementation of anaerobic digestion as an alternative treatment method for sewage sludge can be seen in many countries, its status in Malaysia is not clear. This study reviewed the current state of sewage sludge treatment in Malaysia and discussed the challenges to promote anaerobic digestion in sewage sludge treatment. Other than the common constraints faced, namely technical, political and economic, the characteristics of sewage sludge in Malaysia are considered to be a factor regarding feasibility. Anaerobic co-digestion is the simultaneous anaerobic digestion of two or more substrates which is a promising possible option to overcome the disadvantages of mono-digestion, and improve the economic viability due to higher methane production. There are a variety of biomasses as co-substrates in Malaysia. However, the anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and sewage sludge might be the most feasible method to overcome such constraints. Adding food waste as co-substrate is suggested as the possible approach to not only improve the process's performance but also help to handle the increasing volume of food waste in Malaysia. This study aims to highlight the potential as well as to provide a starting point for further studies regarding the treatment of sewage sludge using anaerobic digestion in Malaysia.",
2574,"Unraveling the effect of inter-basin water transfer on reducing water scarcity and its inequality in China Securing water supply in the face of increasing water scarcity is one important challenge faced by humanity in sustainable development. Inter-basin water transfer is widely applied to provide water supply security in regions where water demand exceeds water availability. However, the effect of inter-basin water transfer on alleviating water scarcity and its inequality is poorly understood especially at the national scale. Based on a newly compiled database of inter-basin water transfer projects in China, here we report a first national assessment of their effect on securing water supply in different basins. We developed a number of indices to facilitate quantifying the effect of water transfer on water scarcity and its inequality. The capacity of inter-basin transfer projects has been steadily increased, which achieved similar to 48.5 billion m(3) yr(-1) by 2016 (equivalent to similar to 8% of the national water use). The results indicate that water transfer has impacted water supply of 43 sub-basins out of a total of 76 sub-basins, but it hardly changes a basin's water scarcity level (e.g., from water scarcity to low water scarcity). Approximately three quarters of people in China are affected by water transfer. More than a half of the national population (705 million) benefit from alleviated water scarcity, leading to the inequality coefficient reduced from 0.64 under natural water availability condition to 0.59 considering water transfer in 2016. However, 357 million people in water transfer source basins are subject to increased water scarcity, in which similar to 21% are from water stressed sub-basins. This study reveals for the first time water transfer induced water scarcity and inequality change across sub-basins in China, and highlights the challenges to secure water supply across basins.

2575,"Vitamin A deficiency and anemia among children 12-71 months old in Honduras Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) have been recognized as public health problems in Honduras for over 30 years. This paper, based on the 1996 National Micronutrient Survey on 1678 children 12-71 months of age, presents the results for vitamin A status and anemia prevalence, as well as the level of vitamin A in sugar at the household level. The results showed that 14% of the children were subclinically vitamin A deficient (plasma retinol < 20 micrograms/dL) and 32% were at risk of VAD (plasma retinol 20-30 micrograms/dL). These data indicate that VAD is a moderate public health problem in Honduras. Logistic regression analysis showed that children 12-23 months old living in areas other than the rural south of the country were at greatest risk of subclinical VAD. Infection, indicated by an elevated alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein level, increased the risk of subclinical VAD more than three-fold. Children from households that obtained water from a river, stream, or lake were at twice the risk of subclinical VAD compared with other children. That same doubled risk was found for children from a household with an outside toilet. VAD can be controlled by fortifying sugar. Retinol levels in sugar at the household level were about 50% of those mandated by Honduran law. There appears to be significant leakage of unfortified sugar into the market. This is particularly true in the rural north, where 33% of samples contained no retinol. Overall, 30% of children were anemic (Hb < 11 g/dL). Logistic regression analysis showed that children whose fathers lived with them but who had not attended at least grade 4 of primary school were at 33% greater risk of being anemic. Infection and being underweight increased the risk of being anemic by 51% and 21%, respectively. Many of the anemic children had not been given iron supplements, suggesting health care providers may not be aware that anemia is widespread among young children and/or know how to diagnose it.",
2576,"Uranium concentrations in South African herbal remedies South Africa contains some of the world's largest mineral deposits, which include uranium. Uranium is mined as a by-product of gold production. The uranium content of the surface soil and groundwater in South Africa has been measured and shows marked variation, depending on location. Herbal remedies are collected by traditional healers from many sites, some of which may be contaminated. Thirty herbal remedies were analyzed using a sensitive adsorptive stripping voltammetry method. Eight samples had levels below the limit of detection, but in five the levels were greatly elevated, showing concentrations above 40,000 ppb. The mean uranium concentration of the remainder of the specimens was of the order of 15,000 ppb. We have attempted to put these data into context by comparison with other studies of absorption of uranium by the oral route.",
2577,"'Chasing for Water': Everyday Practices of Water Access in Peri-Urban Ashaiman, Ghana Despite recent reports suggesting that access to improved sources of drinking water is rising in Ghana, water access remains a daily concern for many of those living in the capital region. Throughout the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), the urban poor manage uncertainty and establish themselves in the city by leveraging a patchwork system of basic services that draws importantly from informal systems and supplies. This paper takes a case study approach, using evidence gathered from two-months of fieldwork in a peri-urban informal settlement on the fringe of Accra, to explore everyday practices involved in procuring water for daily needs that routinely lead residents outside of the official water supply system. Findings from this case study demonstrate that respondents make use of informal water services to supplement or 'patch up' gaps left by the sporadic water flow of the official service provider, currently Ghana Water Company Ltd. (GWCL). Basic water access is thus constructed through an assemblage of coping strategies and infrastructures. This analysis contributes to understandings of heterogeneity in water access by attending to the everyday practices by which informality is operationalised to meet the needs of the urban poor, in ways that may have previously been overshadowed. This research suggests, for example, that although water priced outside of the official service provider is generally higher per unit, greater security may be obtained from smaller repetitive transactions as well as having the flexibility to pursue multiple sources of water on a day-to-day basis.",
2578,"Assessment of soil and water contamination around an ash-disposal site: A case study from the Seyitomer coal-fired power plant in western Turkey Seyitomer power plant comprises 4.8% of Turkey's total energy production. The fly ash produced has been deposited in the area, since the 1960s, by a dry disposal technique. In 1997, wet disposal was improperly exercised in the area causing ash flow over agricultural fields. This study is concerned with the chemical analysis of ash, soil and water samples collected in the area following ash-removal studies after the ash flow in 1997. The results reveal that Na, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Al, Fe, Co, and Cr contents of soil and water are governed by basement lithology in the area, whereas Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu contents are determined by fly ash from rom disposal sites. Although lithogenic Cr and Co contents are exceedingly high, comparison with the regulatory standards for drinking water, irrigation water and agricultural soils reveals no pollution pertinent to solid waste production in waters, whereas there is moderate pollution by Pb and Cu in soils.",
2579,"Site-specific characterization of Castromil Brownfield area related to gold mining activities Castromil is one of the goldmining areas in Portugal that has been abandoned since 1940. This area, which was first mined in Roman times, is located within a Hercynian granite body near the contact with Silurian metasediments. Gold is essentially disseminated along veins in the silicified granite, running NW - SE, related with a shear zone and frequently associated with sulphides ( arsenopyrite and basically pyrite). In paragenetic terms, three stages of mineralization are considered: ferro-arseniferous (quartz + arsenopyrite I + pyrite I + pyrrhotite + bismuth), zinciferous (sphalerite + chalcopyrite), and remobilization ( arsenopyrite II + galena + gold). Due to the lack of laws and environmental education, Castromil is today a gold mining heritage site where we can detect the consequences of an incautious exploration ( tailings, wells and adits located in the old explored zone) and where a residential area is located. In order to characterize the actual state of the old mining area the trace metal contamination of soils and waters by mining activities was investigated. In the studied area 106 soil samples, 15 waters and 20 plants were sampled and analysed. The soil samples were analysed for 32 elements by ICP-AES. Waters were analysed by ionic chromatography and ICP-MS for major and trace elements. Plants were analysed for As, Fe and Pb by AAS. The results are discussed taking into account the risk-based standards for soils and groundwater's ( target and intervention values) proposed by Swartjes ( 1999). The results show elevated concentration of As and Pb which were found in soils collected from agricultural areas. Foodstuff plants species collected in the Castromil agricultural area show high concentrations of As in the leaves ( cabbage and lettuce) and in the tubers ( potatoes). Groundwaters in the mining area contain high concentrations of As that exceeds the intervention values. The area must to be subject to a remediation process, considering the actual risks to humans and ecosystems and the risks due to contaminant migration.",
2580,"Evaluation of the stability of a rock septum between two large derivation tunnels under high hydrostatic pressure The two twin derivation tunnels of a large hydroelectric project in Brazil were 20m apart one from the other, separated by a rock septum. The failure of the gate at the inlet of one of the tunnels promoted the sudden draw down of the reservoir. The maximum velocity of the water was calculated as being of some 50 m/s, causing heavy erosion of the tunnel in its first 50 m, reducing the rock septum thickness to only 12m. A concrete plug was to be built at the middle portion of the damaged tunnel and then the reservoir would be filled again, but maintaining the neighbor tunnel closed and empty for some time, before it also receives a concrete plug. The problem consisted in the assessment of the strength of the rock septum and its stability when subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of 18MPa, which could cause failure of the rock wall, leading to a disaster with the emptying of the reservoir again. The paper describes the studies performed, comprising geological and geomechanical characterization of the rock septum, finite element analysis under diverse conditions and the conclusion derived as well as the protection measures taken. The concrete plugs were built, the reservoir was filled successfully and the project is in operation for some years now without any problem.",
2581,"Temporal-spatial patterns of three types of pesticide loadings in a middle-high latitude agricultural watershed Pesticide loadings to watersheds increase during agricultural development and may vary in accordance with different crop types and seasons. High pesticide loadings can potentially result in polluted stream water. The objective of this study was to determine the pesticide loadings and concentrations of three typical pesticides (atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane) in river water from a middle-high latitude agricultural watershed in northern China. During this study, we evaluated the watershed pesticide loss patterns for two crop types over three decades. For this purpose, we integrated data from field investigations, laboratory experiments, and modeling simulations involving a distributed hydrological solute transport model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT). SWAT was employed to compare the temporal-spatial fate and behaviors of atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane from 1990 to 2014 in a watershed area amounting to 141.5Â km(2). The results showed that the three pesticides could be detected at different locations throughout the watershed, and isoprothiolane was detected at the maximum value of 1.082Â Î¼g/L in surface runoff of paddy land. The temporal trend for the yearly loading of atrazine decreased slightly over time, but the trends for oxadiazon and isoprothiolane increased markedly over an 18-year analysis period. In regard to the pesticide concentrations in water, atrazine was associated with the largest value of nearly 1.4Â Î¼g/L. July and August were the found to be prime periods for pesticide loss from paddy land, and the biggest monthly loss of atrazine from dryland appeared in June. Under similar usage conditions, isoprothiolane loading from paddy fields ranked as the largest one among the three types of pesticides and reached up to 17Â g/ha. Limited monitoring data were useful for validating the model, which yielded valuable temporal-spatial data on the fate of pesticides in this watershed. With the expansion of paddy rice cultivation, risks for pesticide contamination of water bodies will increase. The results of this study should be valuable for future exposure and risk assessments aimed at protecting the environment and human health.",
2582,"Does the recycling of waste streams from drinking water treatment plants worsen the quality of finished water? A case assessment in China The overall purpose was to assess the feasibilities of recycling filter backwash water (FBWW) and combined filter backwash water (CFBWW) in a drinking water treatment plant in south China. The variations of regular water-quality indexes, metal indexes (Al, Mn and Cd), polyacrylamide and disinfection by-product indexes (trihalomethanes and their formation potentials) along with the treatment and the recycling processes were monitored. Results showed the recycling procedure caused increases of turbidity, total solids, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), permanganate index (CODMn), and dissolved organic carbon, Al, Mn and Cd concentrations in a mixture of raw water and FBWW or CFBWW compared to those in raw water. However, the recycling procedure had negligible impacts on the qualities of settled water and filtered water because most of the contaminants could be effectively removed by the conventional water treatment process. Although recycling did cause slight increases of NH3-N and CODMn levels in settled water and filtered water, the quality of finished water always conformed to Chinese standards for drinking water quality according to the surveyed indexes in the present study. Thus, it is appropriate to recycle waste streams in water-stressed areas if the source water is well managed and the water treatment processes are carefully conducted.",
2583,"Dietary Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Animal Protein Intake and Their Association to the Linear Growth Trajectory of Children from Birth to 24 Months of Age: Results From MAL-ED Birth Cohort Study Conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests lack of understanding of the association of specific nutrients with different time points of linear growth trajectory. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of dietary macro- and micronutrients on length-for-age z (LAZ) score trajectory of children across first 24 months of their life. METHODS: The MAL-ED Bangladesh birth cohort study recruited 265 healthy newborn children after birth. The linear growth trajectory of those children was modeled using latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) technique. RESULTS: Dietary magnesium intake at 9 to 11 months was positively associated (coefficient Î² = 0.006, P < .02) with LAZ at 12 months. Animal protein intake at 15 to 17 months, in turn, was positively associated (Î² = 0.03, P < .03) with LAZ at 18 months. However, vitamin D intake at 15 to 17 months was negatively associated (Î² = -0.06, P < .02) with LAZ at 18 months. Other micro- and macronutrients did not show any statistically significant association with the linear growth trajectory. We also found that birth weight (Î² = 0.91, P < .01), treating water (Î² = 0.35, P < 0.00), and maternal height (Î² = 3.4, P < .00) were positively associated with intercept. Gender had a significant negative association with the intercept, but a positive association with the slope (Î² = -0.39, P < .01; Î² = 0.08, P < .04), respectively. Conversely, birth weight had negative association with the slope (Î² = -0.12, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary magnesium and animal protein were positively and vitamin D was negatively associated with the linear growth trajectory. Maternal height, birth weight, gender, and treatment of drinking water also played significant roles in directing the trajectory.",
2584,"Another dimension to grazing systems: Soil carbon In 1998, Fisher et al. attempted to draw together published and anecdotal information to answer some of the questions raised by the findings of Fisher et al. (1994; 1995), that introduced pastures of African grasses on the eastern plains of Colombia accumulated large amounts of C in the soil. This review synthesises the work in both Colombia and Brazil over the last 7 years that answers some of the questions raised and speculations made by Fisher et al. (1998). The most important studies have shown that the rate at which litter decays at the soil surface has been grossly underestimated in the past. As a consequence, net aerial primary productivity (NAPP) was shown to be 33.3-33.5 t/ha/yr in well managed pastures of introduced grasses without either a legume component or N fertiliser. While data for soil C vary according to the past history and states of the pasture, well managed pastures do accumulate C in the soil to levels above that under the native grassland vegetation. Net primary productivity below ground was only slightly less than NAPP. Deficiencies of N and P are primarily responsible for the widespread degradation that occurs when introduced pastures are overgrazed and not fertilised. Heavy stocking rates profoundly change the N cycle and lead to N deficiency and hence degradation in the bulk pasture area by concentrating N recycling from faeces and urine in rest areas and watering points. Here the pasture is so damaged by trampling that it cannot take advantage of the increased fertility.",
2585,"Considering Alternate Pathways of Drinking-Water Contamination: Evidence of Risk Substitution from Arsenic Mitigation Programs in Rural Bangladesh Deep tubewells are a key component of arsenic mitigation programs in rural Bangladesh. Compared to widely prevalent shallow tubewells, deep tubewells reduce ground-water arsenic exposure and provide better microbial water quality at source. However, the benefits of clean drinking-water at these more distant sources may be abated by higher levels of microbial contamination at point-of-use. One such potential pathway is the use of contaminated surface water for washing drinking-water storage containers. The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of surface water use for washing drinking-water storage containers among deep and shallow tubewell users in a cohort of 499 rural residents in Matlab, Bangladesh. We employ a multi-level logistic regression model to measure the effect of tubewell type and ownership status on the odds of washing storage containers with surface water. Results show that deep tubewell users who do not own their drinking-water tubewell, have 6.53 times the odds [95% CI: 3.56, 12.00] of using surface water for cleaning storage containers compared to shallow tubewell users, who own their drinking-water source. Even deep tubewell users who own a private well within walking distance have 2.53 [95% CI: 1.36, 4.71] times the odds of using surface water compared to their shallow tubewell counterparts. These results highlight the need for interventions to limit risk substitution, particularly the increased use of contaminated surface water when access to drinking water is reduced. Increasing ownership of and proximity to deep tubewells, although crucial, is insufficient to achieve equity in safe drinking-water access across rural Bangladesh.",
2586,"Impact of environmental pollution on the growth and production of Egyptian clover The present study investigated the impact of environmental pollution, represented in soil, irrigation water and air heavy metals, on the growth and production of Egyptian clover cultivated at south Greater Cairo, Egypt. Plants were sampled through five quadrats (0.5x0.5 m), distributed equally in four cultivated farms in unpolluted and polluted sites, at the harvesting time. In addition, soil, air and irrigation water were collected from each farm. Significant differences in air, soil and irrigation water between the polluted and unpolluted sites were recognized. Plant density, shoot and root lengths; as well as biomass and yield were remarkably lower in the polluted site. In contrast with chlorophyll b; chlorophyll a and carotenoids contents were lower in clover cultivated in the polluted site. However, chlorophyll a/b ratio was significantly higher in plants from the polluted site. It was found that, As, Cr, Ni, Zn, Ag and V were significantly higher in clover shoots than roots, while Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn and Co concentrations were higher in the roots. The bioaccumulation and translocation factors of most heavy metals were greater than unity indicating high potential of the study species for phytoremediation in polluted areas. Egyptian clover accumulated toxic concentrations of Fe, Pb, Ni, Zn, Cd, Cr and Co, which have adverse effects directly on livestock and indirectly on human health through its flow in the food chain. In order to use Egyptian clover as a forage crop, its cultivation should be avoided in polluted areas.",
2587,"Controversy - What to Publish and How to Publish in the Annual Set of the Environment Protection As a result of my initiative Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of Environment Protection in Koszalin under auspices of the Polish Academy of Sciences was registered by Regional Court in Koszalin Civil Division on April 5th 1998. Generally the only goal of the Society was to publish a good journal in widely understood environmental issues. Of course, I assumed in advance, as the initiator of this project, it will be to published socially and on the basis of membership fees, but mainly using external grants obtained from various sources. It is understandable that in such situation, without employees due to the economic and physical logistic capabilities, this journal can only be an annual publication, not a journal published with higher frequency. Environmental protection engineering is a discipline (disciplines to be precise - separately protection and engineering) extremely capacious factually, the more so that talking about widely understood environmental protection we must not only take into account technique and technology associated with it, but also economics and marketing of the environment, law and education concerning the environment. Taking into consideration above mentioned, we decided to issue Rocznik Ochrona Srodowiska ROS (Annual Set of the Environment Protection) with such broad spectrum, but with a focus primarily on publishing papers concerning research on processes and research on full technologies of water treatment, domestic and industrial wastewater treatment, mechanical and physicochemical, chemical, and in particular, thermal waste processing, exhaust after-treatment and thus protection of the atmosphere including odors. These are the works most creative and consequently having a chance to be applied. Of course, among foreground papers accepted for publication there are also sophisticated theoretical works describing phenomena, endearing these phenomena in mathematical physical formulas or mathematical analytical and empirical formulas and explaining the causal mechanisms identified process run. In the second group of works accepted for publication there are papers in the field of nature protection against the effects of technological development of societies. Such papers, which are mainly prepared naturalists concern the assessment of, for example, water (in rivers, lakes, oceans), soil and plants are therefore the diagnosis of the condition of state based on samples when the team of authors has often high-end analytical equipment. It is therefore a diagnosis of the state which, however, usually do not end up with treatment of environment proposition, but just complaining on the poor state of nature, comparing obtained results of the analytical tests with standards. Finally, the third group of works that we accept for publication, still trying to keep the priorities and proportions, are papers concerning economics, marketing, law, and education on the environment, that is environmental education. It is also obvious that, depending on the issues of the given publication in may be more or less specific, and therefore more scientific or more newspaper type and here arises the problem of so-called scientific and factual levels of submitted works. Our journal Rocznik Ochrona Srodowiska ROS (Annual Set of the Environment Protection) over the years of it s publication was obtaining higher and higher rank both on Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education list as well as lists of foreign institutions of the International Scientific Information. With the entry of our journal onto the so-called Philadelphia list we have been ""inundated"" with incredible amount of publications of which large part is, just to be honest, hopelessly poor. The first group of these hopeless works are publications that discuss the problem at the newspaper level (popularizing science) in which there are no errors or controversial entries except that for science of these works contribute nothing and can be at most opening lecture of an excellent professor as the introduction for a conference. The second group of poor wor s are submitted publications with research character, but scope of these studies of a given process may correspond to a student laboratory exercises of this the process included a single report. The third group of submitted poor works are so-called descriptions of the state for example in the range of issues of protection of the earth's surface, often without geological studies and have a mode of warning the reader against negative effects of mining operations (in particular, so-called pits). To cover up the poor quality of such works, they contain most often terrain maps, images (often illegible) and diagrams, which often result from citing data from the Statistical Yearbooks. The biggest problem for our editorial board, and most of all for me personally, as Chairman of the Board of our Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of Environment Protection and the Scientific Editor is the fact that the authors and mainly co-authors of those poor (mostly rejected) submitted publications are, unfortunately, great and significant names in a given branch. As Editor-in-Chief of ROS I am leveraged from one side to accept a manuscript for publication, while on the other hand, I do not act in a vacuum and in isolation from the whole system of science promotion, through different types of connections, informal pacts so-called social of different kinds of interest groups, careers groups when, however, the position of people or team largely depends on who, where and in which committees they sit and what produces they give - here, for example, about me - prof. Tadeusz Piecuch, about my team of my co-workers at the University and finally, about the ROS, which I created with a group of amicable professors, of which I am the Publisher and the Editor-in-Chief. I know, and I am aware of the fact that publications that were accepted for publication, and therefore were published in our ROS also present a different scientific level, but it is very difficult to assess from which level the work is already good, very good and maybe even outstanding, and how far is good publication from hardly sufficient, and this sufficient from hopeless. The notes are not 0 - 1 (black or white) and I am well aware that some papers published in ROS may be differently assessed and cause different different feelings, and sometimes even reader's sense of injustice, whose work was rejected by us. If it is the case I apologise for that all those people and ask them to believe that from my side and the entire Editorial Board there are no bad intentions, but on the contrary, good works are important for us. Therefore moving within the above mentioned structures and pacts which may be called a ""china shop"" is fiendishly difficult, when for example from one side you do not want to offend anyone, and multiply enemies, and at the same time you want to keep at least at a decent level fairness of assessment, objectivity towards submitted often poor works which often are supported by significant and influential names. Taking into account given above clarifications and problems that I have to solve every day I present here an example of such my drudgery as a Editor in Chief of ROS - and therefore the example of problems that I will encounter during procedure of publication, as a particularly difficult example.",
2588,"Flood Risk Assessment Using GIS (Case Study: Golestan Province, Iran) In recent years humans have endured increasing numbers of natural disasters, of which flooding is the greatest and most common throughout the world. Iran is also exposed to floods, considering the severe damage recently incurred in Golestan province, particularly Gorganroud watershed. Due to the importance of the subject and lack of comprehensive studies on flood risk in the country's watersheds, it is crucial to perform flood risk assessment using appropriate tools, such as Landsat ETM+ imaging and digital elevation model data collections in geographic information system throughout the region. For this purpose, database maps of 6 sub-watersheds in Gorganroud watershed were prepared in 5 layers affecting flooding in the region. By overlaying and weighing three layers in GIS software, a layer of flood hazard intensity was obtained. Next, by means of obtained numbers and scoring, the overuse layer priorities were determined. Then, these two flooding layers were overlaid with the help of a two-dimensional matrix, and the final map of flood risk was obtained. Finally, it was found that Chelichay and Sarab Gorganroud, making up to 24.59% of the Gorganroud watershed, are the most risky sub-watersheds. In light of the fact that the data pertaining to Gorganroud watershed have never been entirely used to sort out the risk priorities in the region, the new method presented in this paper can lead to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding about what is really taking place in it.",
2589,"Knowledge and practices of households on safe water chain maintenance in a slum community in Kampala City, Uganda BackgroundMore than half of the disease burden in Uganda can be prevented through improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). In slum communities, water supply is insufficient but also highly contaminated; therefore, ensuring that the safe water chain is maintained by households is paramount to preventing water-related diseases. This study aimed at assessing knowledge and practices of households on safe water chain maintenance in slum communities in Kampala City, Uganda.MethodsThis was a community-based cross-sectional study carried out among 395 households in slum communities in Kampala, Uganda. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and their 95% confidence intervals were used as a measure of association between safe water chain management and associated knowledge and practice factors. The PRs were obtained using a multivariable modified Poisson regression with logarithm as the link function, with robust standard errors.ResultsMajority (76.7%, 303/395) ofthe households collected their water from a piped water system and paid for the water (72.9%, 288/395). Almost all (97.2%, 384/395) of the participants said that they knew the dangers associated with drinking unsafe water, boiled their drinking water (95.4%, 377/395), and used storage containers that minimize contamination (97.0%, 383/395). However, only (32.4%, 128/395) of the households satisfactorily maintained the safe water chain. Female- (adjusted PR=1.82, 95% CI (1.19-2.78)) and student-led households (adjusted PR=1.58, 95% CI (1.03-2.41)) and those whose heads had attained post-primary education (adjusted PR=1.48, 95% CI (1.02-2.17)) were more likely to satisfactorily maintain the safe water chain. This was similar among members who thought most contamination occurs during storage (adjusted PR=1.47, 95% CI (1.10-1.97)).ConclusionOnly a third of the households maintained the safe water chain satisfactory. Female-led, student-led, and post-primary educated-led household and household that thought most contamination occurs during storage were more likely to maintain the safe water chain. There is a need to improve the level of awareness about the importance of the safe water chain amongslum dwellers.",
2590,"Effects of developmental arsenite exposure on hippocampal synapses in mouse offspring Arsenic exposure through drinking water can impair the learning and memory ability of children in China and other countries. Synaptic plasticity plays a key role in the process of learning and memory. Alterations in the expression of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins can be used to evaluate synaptic plasticity, and further to evaluate impairment in learning and memory ability. Thereby, the aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying arsenic neurotoxicity by focusing on alterations in the hippocampal synapses of mouse offspring induced by developmental arsenite exposure. Mother mice and their offspring were exposed to 0, 25, 50 or 100 mg L(-1) arsenite via drinking water from the first day of gestation until postnatal day (PND) 35. The spatial learning and memory ability of PND 35 mice was evaluated using a Morris water maze. The levels of speciated arsenicals in the brain of PND 7, 14, 21 and 35 mice were analyzed by hydride generation coupled with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Synaptic structure and protein expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SYP) in the hippocampus of PND 7, 14, 21 and 35 mice were examined. The findings from this study disclosed that the spatial learning ability of mice could be impaired by exposure to 25 mg L(-1) arsenite; however spatial memory ability could not be impaired until exposure to 100 mg L(-1) arsenite. The thickness of the postsynaptic density (PSD) decreased, whereas the width of the synaptic cleft widened significantly in arsenite exposure groups. Moreover, protein expression of both PSD-95 and SYP decreased significantly in arsenite exposure groups. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that developmental arsenite exposure could depress the expression of synaptic proteins, subsequently cause alteration in synaptic structures, and finally contribute to arsenite-induced deficits in spatial learning and memory ability in mouse offspring.",
2591,"Breast-feeding protects against arsenic exposure in Bangladeshi infants BACKGROUND: Chronic arsenic exposure causes a wide range of health effects, but little is known about critical windows of exposure. Arsenic readily crosses the placenta, but the few available data on postnatal exposure to arsenic via breast milk are not conclusive. AIM: Our goal was to assess the arsenic exposure through breast milk in Bangladeshi infants, living in an area with high prevalence of arsenic-rich tube-well water. METHODS: We analyzed metabolites of inorganic arsenic in breast milk and infant urine at 3 months of age and compared them with detailed information on breast-feeding practices and maternal arsenic exposure, as measured by concentrations in blood, urine, and saliva. RESULTS: Arsenic concentrations in breast-milk samples were low (median, 1 microg/kg; range, 0.25-19 microg/kg), despite high arsenic exposures via drinking water (10-1,100 microg/L in urine and 2-40 microg/L in red blood cells). Accordingly, the arsenic concentrations in urine of infants whose mothers reported exclusive breast-feeding were low (median, 1.1 microg/L; range, 0.3-29 microg/L), whereas concentrations for those whose mothers reported partial breast-feeding ranged from 0.4 to 1,520 microg/L (median 1.9 microg/L). The major part of arsenic in milk was inorganic. Still, the infants had a high fraction (median, 87%) of the dimethylated arsenic metabolite in urine. Arsenic in breast milk was associated with arsenic in maternal blood, urine, and saliva. CONCLUSION: Very little arsenic is excreted in breast milk, even in women with high exposure from drinking water. Thus, exclusive breast-feeding protects the infant from exposure to arsenic.",
2592,"A waterborne outbreak of epidemic diarrhea due to group A rotavirus in Malatya, Turkey We characterized an outbreak of acute diarrheal disease caused by group A rotavirus that occurred during the Autumn of 2005 in Malatya City Turkey A total 9907 patients between 0 to 91 years old (mean age: 25.05 +/- 19.67) were included in the epidemic. The patients' data were prospectively collected and statistically analyzed. Microbiologic analyses were performed to determine the etiologic agent. Rapid onset diarrhea (98.36%), abdominal cramps (69%), fever (44.4%) and vomiting (69.6%) were the most common symptoms observed in patients. Rotavirus antigen was detected in 52.7% of the studied patients. RT-PCR analysis led to identification of Group A rotavirus as the causative agent of this epidemic. Simultaneous measurements of the drinking water samples yielded very low chlorine levels; as low as 0 to 0.05 mg/L. The outbreak investigation team indicated possible contamination of a large water depository from a water well, which supplies drinking water to two major districts of the city Effective chlorination and blockage of the passage between the well and the water depository stopped the outbreak. This outbreak shows the high epidemic potency of rotavirus in large human populations, including all age groups, and underlines the importance of water safety in pipeline systems.",
2593,"Digital mapping of potentially toxic elements enrichment in soils of Urmia Lake due to water level decline Anthropogenic activities, in addition to climate change caused the drying of Urmia Lake in Iran, since 2005. Dust storms blown from the dried lakebed have created serious environmental hazards in adjacent areas. These crises would jeopardise achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and emphasise the need for evaluating the spatial distribution of soil enrichment of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn). Conventional assessment would require a costly sampling method to map potentially polluted areas. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has proved to be a cost-efficient method for soil mapping, however its application in mapping enrichment of PTEs in soil is still lacking. This study aims to map and project the potential pollution of PTEs in the Urmia Lake area using digital mapping techniques and Landsat-8 OLI satellite images. A total of 129 surficial soil samples were collected as ground control. Enrichment factors (EFs) of PTEs and the Modified Pollution Index (MPI) were spatially predicted using two machine learning models. Covariates were derived from a suite of Landsat-8 spectral indices. The bootstrapping method was used to analyse the uncertainties. The results showed that Random Forests performed well in estimating EFs of several PTEs. Spectral indices using NIR and SWIR bands were key to predict these PTEs and MPI. The digital maps demonstrated that the study area was enriched with As, Cu and Pb at moderate to significant levels. Regions under the lower ecological level (elevation <-1274Â m) had significantly larger enrichment than those of higher elevation. Based on MPI, 43% of the area was categorised as moderately polluted, and 31% of the area was moderately-heavily polluted. Possible sources of PTEs were discharges from farmlands, landfills, and industries. Our results revealed that the Urmia Lake desiccating has caused severe environmental challenges and needs immediate restoration.",
2594,"Paleoclimatic and archaeological evidence from Lake Suches for highland Andean refugia during the arid middle-Holocene Severe aridity during the mid-Holocene, ca. 8.0-4.0 kyr BP, led to extreme ecological stress in the tropical Andes. Here, we report paleolimnological and archeological data from Lake Suches in southern Peru (70 degrees 24' 12 W, 16 degrees 55' 35 S) spanning 13.6-4.4 kyr BP. Integrated paleoclimate and archeological data reveal that moisture was locally available and the basin served as an ecological refugium throughout the mid-Holocene. Mid-Holocene aridity was established no later than 7.2 kyr BP, with maximum aridity ca. 5.5-4.8 kyr BP. However, water levels in Lake Suches were sustained throughout peak middle-Holocene aridity, even as other systems desiccated. Isotopic enrichment of water in Lake Suches (O-18(lake)) and extensive wetlands (O-18(bofedal)) surrounding the lake indicate prolonged residence time. These reservoirs, combined with elevation-linked hydrographic factors, mitigated mid-Holocene net decreases in atmospheric moisture. Archeological data from Suches indicate successive population increases beginning ca. 11.0-9.8 kyr BP as drier but more stable early Holocene conditions were established regionally. Population maxima in Suches during the mid-Holocene/mid-Archaic period ca. 9.0-7.0 kyr BP coincide with peak aridity in the Titicaca and Atacama systems, as well as documented archeological hiatuses in these regions. Population decreases coincide with peak aridity recorded in Lake Suches ca. 6.0-5.0 kyr BP, but the basin was never fully abandoned. Evidence for refugial microenvironments is key to understanding the persistence of human populations and other endemic Andean flora and fauna during the highly adverse climates of the middle-Holocene. We outline several mechanisms which likely explain the formation of refugia linked to bofedales and hydrographic characteristics of Suches. Understanding refugial dynamics will be key to understanding the effects of past climatic change, as well as addressing current warming and decreased precipitation trends in the tropical Andes.",
2595,"CHALLENGING ANALYTICAL TASK: ANALYSIS AND MONITORING OF ARSENIC SPECIES IN WATER Analysis and monitoring of arsenic is still a challenging analytical task. Due to its complex behaviour (different forms of arsenic that can be present depending on pH and oxidation states of arsenic) as well as demanding analytical procedures and instrumental tools for control of arsenic concentration in drinking water which is set to 10 mu g L-1, there are still some open questions and issues when arsenic is the scientific topic. In this paper the idea was to use a multivariate statistical approach to identify the key variables and their relation to high arsenic concentration in surface waters of Serbia. The main idea was to identify and connect the key water quality parameters with arsenic concentration and to suggest adequate treatment technologies for water purification and arsenic removal. The data set for multivariate statistical approach were water quality parameters of surface water samples from Serbia. The artificial neural network (ANN) was applied for data analysis. After applying ANN the results showed strong relation between arsenic concentration and P-tot, SO42-, COD, carbonate, N-org, DO, and SiO2 content. What could be concluded from the obtained results is that high concentration of organic matter, proportional to nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), silica (SiO2) and dissolved oxygen highly correlates with the dissolved arsenic which implies that the most adequate technology for the water treatment could be precipitation, which in general includes coagulation. What remains unquestioned and needs to be performed is arsenic speciation analysis.",
2596,"Rainfall-runoff modeling for predictive infiltration and recharge areas for water management in semi-arid basin: a case study from Saadine watershed, Tunisia Due to the water supply increase and drought-associated problems, optimal water resources management is of a prior need in arid and semi-arid area. The groundwater recharge as an optimal utilization and storage of floodwater constitutes an ideal strategy in water resources management. The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the spatial distribution of the infiltration and suitable sites for groundwater artificial recharge in a semi-arid basin in Tunisia. The Kineros2 rainfall-runoff model and Geographic Information Systems were used. The datasets required for the model parameters were extracted from maps of soil properties and land cover or extracted from the Digital Elevation Model of the area. The results of simulations reveal that the infiltration values depend on the initial soil moisture. The infiltration rate was closely related to the precipitation quantity and rainstorm duration. The strong rain often leads to overland-flow, overwhelming the infiltration; in contrast, medium and weak but continuous rainfalls favor infiltration process.",
2597,"Groundwater Banking in the Rio Grande Basin The water planning and management policies of the Rio Grande basin no longer respond to the sustainable needs of water users, environment, and international commitments of this transboundary basin between Mexico and the United States. This paper describes how groundwater banking through an in lieu method is one approach leading to better water management in this basin. In lieu groundwater banking is a conjunctive water allocation policy applicable to water users supplied from surface water and groundwater sources. A basin simulation model of the Rio Grande basin, built in the water evaluation and planning system (WEAP) software, was used to evaluate the groundwater banking policy. Two scenarios are discussed: a baseline scenario without new water allocation policies implemented and a groundwater banking scenario considering the in lieu groundwater banking method implemented in the Meoqui aquifer. Results show that groundwater banking can significantly improve water management in the basin, increasing system storage, improving water supply for users in the basin, and enhancing compliance with the treaty obligations.",
2598,"Nexus Strength: A Novel Metric for Assessing the Global Resource Nexus The limited access to natural resources is a major constraint for sustainability at various spatial scales. This challenge has sparked scholarly interest in the linkages or nexus between resources, with a view to helping anticipate unforeseen consequences, identify trade-offs and co-benefits, and find optimal solutions. Yet, despite decades of research, limitations in the scope and focus of studies remain. Recently constructed multiregional input-output (MRIO) databases, which cover the global economy and its use of resources in unprecedented detail, allow systematically investigation of resource use by production as well as consumption processes at various levels and garner new insights into global resource nexus (GRN) issues. This article addresses the question of how to prioritize such issues. Using the MRIO database, EXIOBASE, we address the GRN considering five key resources: blue water, primary energy, land, metal ores, and minerals. We propose a metric of nexus strength, which relies on linear goal programming to rank industries and products based on its associated combined resource use and various weighting schemes. Our results validate current research efforts by identifying water, energy, and land as the strongest linkages globally and at all scales and, at the same time, lead to novel findings into the GRN, in that (1) it appears stronger and more complex from the consumption perspective, (2) metals and minerals emerge as critical, yet undervalued, components, and (3) it manifests with a considerable diversity across countries owing to differences in the economic structure, domestic policy, technology, and resource endowments.",
2599,"An invisible workforce: the neglected role of cleaners in patient safety on maternity units Hospital cleaning has been shown to impact on rates of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and good environmental hygiene is critical to quality care, yet those tasked with the role of ensuring a safe and clean environment often go unrecognised as members of the healthcare workforce. Sepsis is a leading cause of maternal and newborn death, a significant proportion of these cases are estimated to be due to HCAIs. Deliveries in health institutions have now reached 75% globally, and in low and middle income countries the corresponding increased pressure on facilities has impacted both quality of care provided and quality of the birth environment in terms of infection prevention and control (IPC) and HCAIs. The paper discusses the neglected role of health facility cleaners, providing evidence from the literature and from needs assessments conducted by The Soapbox Collaborative and partners in Bangladesh, India, The Gambia and Zanzibar. While not the primary focus of the assessments, common themes emerged consistently pointing to institutional neglect of cleaning and cleaners. The paper argues that low status within facilities, wider societal marginalisation, lack of training, and poor pay and working conditions contribute to the lack of prioritisation placed on health facility environmental hygiene. With increased international attention focused towards health facility water, sanitation and hygiene and a growing focus on IPC, now is the time to address the neglect of this frontline healthcare workforce. We propose that provision of and improved training can enable the recognition of the valuable role cleaning staff play, as well as equipping these staff with the tools required to perform their job to the highest standard. In addition to training, wider systems changes are necessary to establish improvements in environmental hygiene and the role of cleaning staff, including addressing resource availability, supportive supervision, and an increased emphasis on preventative healthcare.",
2600,"Effects of afforestation on soil organic carbon and other soil properties Soil organic carbon (SOC) makes up a significant portion of the worlds terrestrial carbon stocks, and changes in land-use and land cover are changing soil carbon stocks. This study investigated the effects on soil organic carbon and some other soil properties of afforestation efforts using 15-year-old Pinus nigra Am. Subsp. nigra (Black Pine) and Cedrus libani A. Rich (Lebanon cedar) on bare land in the semi-arid Nigde Akkaya dam watershed for erosion control and green belt creation. Soil samples were collected from three land use types (Black Pine planted, Lebanon cedar planted area and bare land) at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) and replicated three times. Among the soil properties substantially affected by the change in land cover are soil organic carbon, bulk density, particle density, water holding capacity and total porosity. Generally, soil organic carbon was observed to increase after afforestation. Soil organic carbon (SOC) values were 1.09% and 1.13% in Black Pine and the Cedar area, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the values for the bare land soils (0.54%). For all types of land use, the amount of SOC in the soils decreased with depth. The amount of carbon sequestrated in Black Pine, Cedar and bare land sites at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm were 18.20 t/ha and 16.33 t/ha, 23.54 t/ha and 1238 t/ha and 112 t/ha and 7.22 t/ha, respectively. The bulk density values obtained from the 0-10 cm layer soils in the afforested lands (1.53 g/cm(3) for Black Pine and 1.58 g/cm(3) for Cedar) were different from and lower than those in bare land (1.75 g/cm(3)). Afforestation efforts led to an increase in water holding capacity (WHC) of the soil. Total porosity (TP) of the 0-10 cm layer soils increased after afforestation. This study indicated that on degraded land in a semiarid region, afforestation increased soil carbon sequestration, improved some soil properties and reduced erosion over a 15-year period.

2601,"Degradation of Poly(Îµ-caprolactone) by a Thermophilic Community and Brevibacillus thermoruber Strain 7 Isolated from Bulgarian Hot Spring The continual plastic accumulation in the environment and the hazardous consequences determine the interest in thermophiles as possible effective plastic degraders, due to their unique metabolic mechanisms and change of plastic properties at elevated temperatures. PCL is one of major biodegradable plastics with promising application to replace existing non-biodegradable polymers. Metagenomic analysis of the phylogenetic diversity in plastic contaminated area of Marikostinovo hot spring, Bulgaria revealed a higher number taxonomic groups (11) in the sample enriched without plastic (Marikostinovo community, control sample, MKC-C) than in that enriched in the presence of poly-Îµ-caprolactone (PCL) (MKC-P), (7). A strong domination of the phylum Proteobacteria was observed for MKC-C, while the dominant phyla in MKC-P were Deinococcus-Thermus and Firmicutes. Among the strains isolated from MKC-P, the highest esterase activity was registered for Brevibacillus thermoruber strain 7 at 55 Â°C. Its co-cultivation with another isolate resulted in ~10% increase in enzyme activity. During a 28-day biodegradation process, a decrease in PCL molecular weight and weight loss were established resulting in 100% degradation by MKC-P and 63.6% by strain 7. PCL degradation intermediate profiles for MKC-P and pure strain were similar. Broken plastic pieces from PCL surface and formation of a biofilm by MKC-P were observed by SEM, while the pure strain caused significant deformation of PCL probes without biofilm formation.",
2602,"LIGHT RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS AND NATURAL SERIES RADIONUCLIDES WITHIN THE MORRO-DO-FERRO As part of the Pocos de Caldas natural analogue project, data are presented on natural series radionuclides (Th-232, Th-230, Th-228, U-234, U-238 and Pa-231) and the light rare earth elements (LREEs) La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm from two boreholes within the near surface thorium-rare earth element ore body known as Morro do Ferro (MF). Under defined conditions, a study of these elements can provide useful information on the long term behavior of chemical analogues present in high level waste (HLW) and on the processes affecting radionuclide migration. Within the deeply weathered mineralized zone, Th decreases exponentially with a half thickness of 10 meters from 5.7% in the surface meter to 0.1% at 36 meters. Since no fractionation of Ra-228 is evident (based on Th-228/Th-232 equilibrium), Ra-228 is essentially decaying in-situ where it is radiogenically produced. Uranium isotopes (mean = 35 ppm as U-238) are found in near equilibriUM (U-234/U-238 range of 0.9 to 1.1) both within the mineralization and down along the hydraulic gradient. No evidence for any significant uranium accumulation exists. Leaching of uranium by infiltrating, oxidizing rain water is postulated as the dominant removal mechanism although preferential loss of U-234 also occurs as evidenced by U-234/U-238 ratios of < 1.0 in rock and between 1.1 and 1.5 in ground water samples. Positive and negative Ce anomalies are reported and have been interpreted as occurring from relic redox fronts which are no longer visible.",
2603,"Nanoparticles from construction wastes: A problem to health and the environment The present study deals with the nano-mineralogy and geochemistry of ultrafine particles in construction waste from the Porto Alegre region in Southern Brazil. Uncontrolled construction waste dumps and poor management practices in formal disposal sites in the area may increase exposure risks to population. Whilst the physicochemical properties of construction wastes are well documented in the literature, the characteristics of nanoparticles in their formulations are not well known. Given that degradation of construction materials may unlock and enable further release of nano-particulates present, we focused on the <63 gm fraction to examine the geochemistry of inhalable nano-particulates that could cause adverse health impacts on local communities. A particular feature across the studied wastes are the numerous aerodynamically favourable, spherical-shaped nanoparticles of magnetite, rutile and anatase. The detected nanoparticles contained a number of elements including Al, As, Au, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Na, Fe, K, S, Sn, Si and. An enrichment in metals and metalloids such as As, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Fe, Sn or Ta in particles in the nano-scale range in relation to larger particles was observed. The presence of carbon nanotubes was also noted. The leaching tests showed that the construction wastes did not reach the limits for their disposal as hazardous waste according the European Directive. Whilst the majority of trace elements were highly immobile, the water extractability for oxyanionic-forming metalloids suggests possible migration to surface and groundwater bodies. This work seeks to bring awareness on the impacts of unsustainable construction waste management, and the relevance of improved regulations regarding their final disposal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

2604,"[Residual Characteristics and Health Assessment Analysis of OCPs and PCBs in Karst Groundwater] Residual levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in karst groundwater in Nanshan Laolongdong were measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a micro-(63)Ni electron capture detector to determine the residual characteristics including concentration, distribution, and source of OCPs and PCBs. Results revealed that the total concentration range of OCPs was 34.8-623.2 ngÂ·L(-1), and the mean value was 215.6 ngÂ·L(-1), among which the total concentration ranges of HCHs, DDTs, and other OCPs were 8.2-23.6, 4.5-363.7, and 22.2-235.9 ngÂ·L(-1), respectively, and the mean values were 15.9, 104.5, and 95.3 ngÂ·L(-1); the total concentration range of PCBs was 6.0-40.7 ngÂ·L(-1), and the mean value was 16.8 ngÂ·L(-1). Overall, the pollution of OCPs and PCBs was above average; the results of multiple comparisons revealed that statistically significant differences occurred in the concentration of some OCPs and PCBs. The pollution levels in the water of each sampling point in the study area were quite different; however, the seasonal distribution of OCPs and PCBs was relatively uniform. Source analyses revealed that HCHs' source was the input of lindane in the surrounding environment, DDTs recently originated from illegal use of industrial DDT, other OCPs originated from atmospheric deposition and agricultural input, and PCBs' sources included both historical remains and enterprise production processes. The results of Pearson correlation analyses revealed that some organo-halogen pollutants were homologous or had similar sources and decomposition mechanisms. According to health risk assessment model, drinking water in the study area would not cause obvious harm to human health, but children were more sensitive to pollutants than adults.",
2605,"A digraph permanent approach to evaluation and analysis of integrated watershed management system In the present study a deterministic quantitative model based on graph theory has been developed for the better development and management of watershed. Graph theory is an integrative systems approach to consider and model structural components of watershed management system along with the interrelationships between them concurrently and integratively. The factors responsible for the development of watershed system are identified. The degree of interaction between one subsystem with others are determined. The eigenvalue formulation is used to take care the inconsistencies arises due to inaccurate judgement in the degree of interaction between the subsystems. In this model the visual analysis is done to abstract the information using the directed graph or digraph. Then the matrix model is developed for computer processing. Variable permanent function in the form of multinomial represents the watershed system uniquely and completely by an index value. Different terms of the multinomial represent all possible subsystems of integrated watershed management system and thus different solutions for watershed management, leading to optimum solution. This index value is used to compare the suitability of the watershed with different alternatives available for its development. So the graph theory analysis presents a powerful tool to generate the optimum solutions for the decision maker for benefit of local people living in the watershed as well as the stakeholders. The proposed methodology is also demonstrated by a suitable example and is applied to the ecosystem and environment subsystem of the lake Qionghai watershed in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

2606,"An integrated eco-model of agriculture and small-scale industry in craft villages toward cleaner production and sustainable development in rural areas - A case study from Mekong delta of Viet Nam The purpose of this work is to develop and prove an eco-based sustainable livelihood model coupling to environmental protection at the craft villages in rural areas. Based on ecological engineering, waste reduction techniques, waste conversion and recycling techniques combined with end-of-pipe treatment techniques, this research developed a model by integrating several technologies. We integrate components such as crop, fishpond, livestock farm, earthworm farm, biogas digester, family household, small-scale industry with craft production and wastewater treatment into one common system in an ecological manner leading to sustainable development of the craft villages. This model allows economic and environmental benefits due to reutilization of wastes from food processing for feeding at livestock farms, which helps to reduce feeding costs. Further, wastes from livestock farms are partly split for composting reducing pollutants load into wastewater treatment plants and so minimizing the capacity needed there and, therefore, the construction costs for biogas plants. Wastes converted into compost fertilize crops and feed earthworms and the utilization of food waste for pig feeding contributes to increased household income of the craft villages in rural areas. Additionally, anaerobic technique coupling to available natural wetlands lower operation costs for wastewater treatment systems. A conceptual framework was developed for the model design and comprehensive application in different cases. The model was demonstrated and proven at a household in the rice starch processing craft village in Dong Thap province, Mekong delta area, Vietnam. The model demonstration showed a win-win solution for households with major benefits by reduction of 50% cost for feeding animals, 50-75% investment cost for the biogas plant and 80-90% operation cost for the wastewater treatment plant. Biogas and compost produced led to more income to the households. Finally yet importantly, quality of outlet wastewater flow now meets the local discharge standards as required by country regulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2607,"Application of Multivariate Statistical Methods and Water Quality Index for the Evaluation of Surface Water Quality in the Cunas River Basin, Peru Watershed management requires information that allows the intervention of possible sources that affect aquatic systems. Surface water quality in the Cunas river basin (Peru) was evaluated using multivariate statistical methods and the CCME-WQI water quality index. Twenty-seven sampling sites were established in the Cunas River and nine sites in the tributary river. Water samples were collected in two contrasting climatic seasons and the CCME-WQI was determined based on physicochemical and bacteriological parameters. The PCA generated three PC with a cumulative explained variation of 78.28 %. The generalised linear model showed strong significant positive relationships (p < 0.001) of E. coli with Fe, nitrate, Cu and TDS, and a strong significant negative relationship (p < 0.001) with pH. Overall, the CCME-WQI showed the water bodies in the upper reaches of the Cunas River as good water quality (87.07), in the middle reaches as favourable water quality (67.65) and in the lower reaches as poor water quality (34.86). In the tributary, the CCME-WQI showed the water bodies as having good water quality (82.34).",
2608,"The assessment of the impact of oil palm and rubber plantations on the biotic and abiotic properties of tropical peat swamp soil in Indonesia Current intensification of agricultural activities in Indonesia has led to increased use of tropical peat swamp forests for agriculture. Ideally, peat swamp ecosystems should not be disturbed as they provide essential services such as soil erosion control, ecosystem stabilization and moderation of climate and energy fluxes as well as reducing carbon emission and conserving biodiversity. In this study, agricultural land from Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve in Indonesia was evaluated to assess the impact of oil palm (burning and without burning) and rubber (5-10 and >40 years old) plantations on soil properties through comparisons with soils from a natural forest (NF). Substantial changes in the physico-chemical properties of soils from both plantations were observed including significant reductions in soil organic matter (4-18%) and water holding capacity (22-53%), but an increase in bulk density (rho b) (0.08-0.17 g cm(-3)). A significant increase in bacterial biomass was also observed following conversion of the NF to plantation (p<0.05). However, the oil palm plantation (OPP) (without burning) showed reduced microbial activities and the lowest Shannon diversity values (2.90) compared to other samples. Community-level physiological profiling showed impaired community function only in soils from the OPP but higher CO2 exchange rates in most plantation soils. Soils from the rubber plantation (RP) were less impaired in terms of their natural function and therefore RPs appeared to be more suitable for sustainable agricultural use than OPP.",
2609,"Influences of pipe materials and hydraulic conditions on the process of trihalomethanes formation in water distribution network In this paper, the influences of different pipe materials and hydraulic conditions on the formation process of trihalomethanes (THMs) were investigated. Water used in this research was taken from a Chinese water treatment plant in the northeastern part of China. The results showed that, under the same condition, the ranking of THM concentration in different pipe materials was: PVC> stainless steel>ductile iron, while it was different for chlorine decay. The variation of THMs in distribution system simulator is consistent with that of bulk water experiment. THM amount is only slightly higher in water distribution system simulator. The trend is not as distinct as that of chlorine decay. A higher flow velocity of water is associated with higher THM concentration, but it was not obvious compared with the decay of chlorine. For the same distance, different flow velocities and diameters, THM concentration was dependent on the influential degree of retention time and flow velocity. For the same distance and different flow velocities, THM concentration increased with the increase of pipe diameter. THM levels in real water distribution networks are dependent on various influences.",
2610,"One-carbon metabolism nutrient intake and the association between body mass index and urinary arsenic metabolites in adults in the Chihuahua cohort BACKGROUND: Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) via drinking water is a serious global health threat. Various factors influence susceptibility to iAs-associated health outcomes, including differences in iAs metabolism. Previous studies have shown that obesity is associated with iAs metabolism. It has been hypothesized that this association can be explained by confounding from nutritional factors involved in one-carbon metabolism, such as folate or other B vitamins, whose intake may differ across BMI categories and is known be associated with iAs metabolism. However, no studies have explored whether this association is confounded by nutritional factors. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the distribution of urinary arsenic species in a cross-sectional cohort of 1166 adults living in Chihuahua, Mexico from 2008 to 2013. Nutrient intake related to one-carbon metabolism, including folate, vitamin B2, and vitamin B12, was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire developed for Mexican populations. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the association between BMI and the distribution of urinary arsenic metabolites. Effect modification by drinking water iAs level and sex was also examined. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, educational attainment, smoking, alcohol consumption, seafood consumption, water iAs, and sex, BMI was negatively associated with the proportion of urinary inorganic arsenic (%U-iAs) and urinary monomethylated arsenic (%U-MMAs) and positively associated with urinary dimethylated arsenic (%U-DMAs). This relationship was not influenced by additional adjustment for folate, vitamin B2, or vitamin B12 intake. Additionally, there was significant effect modification by both drinking water iAs level and sex. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence for an association between BMI and arsenic metabolism. However, contrary to previous hypotheses, these results suggest that this association is not confounded by the intake of micronutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism.",
2611,"Pilot-scale performance of iron and arsenic removal from contaminated groundwater Pilot-scale performance in reducing excess iron and arsenic from contaminated groundwater has been systematically reported. Here, a double column unit, the first packed with beta-MnO2 and the second with crystalline FeOOH (goethite variety), with filters attached to the outlet of hand-pump tube-wells has been used in the field. Results showed that the filters generate 10,000 to 15,000 BV and 19,000 to 35,000 BV water with iron <= 0.3 mg/L and arsenic <= 10 mu g/L from groundwater having influent iron and arsenic levels of 3.75 to 7.25 mg/L and 70 to 220 mu g/L, respectively. The downflow rate of effluent water was 237.6 to 305.5 L/m(2)-Min. The performance results were achieved with a single charging of the iron and arsenic removal media. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) tests of the waste (arsenic content: 2.4 g/kg) showed that it is not hazardous to the environment and does not pose any risk to users. Cost evaluation showed $US0.50 to 0.70 per 1000 gallons of treated water and, hence, the technology is cost-effective for countries such as India and Bangladesh.",
2612,"A new fossil mustelid from the Miocene of South Dakota, USA A skull from the Barstovian of South Dakota has typical leptarctine characteristics, including robust zygomatic arches, double sagittal crests, grooves on the lingual side of the lower canines, and bony projections from the tympanic bullae. The robust mandibles and expanded masseteric fossa of this specimen indicate that it had large jaw muscles. Dental morphology and other characters lead us to agree with earlier suggestions that Hypsoparia is a valid genus. The morphology of Hypsoparia suggests that leptarctines were more herbivorous than most other Carnivora. Mustelids vary greatly in size and include 67 extant species in 25 genera. These species occupy many habitats, including fresh and salt water, and all land areas of the world except the West Indies, Madagascar, Sulawesi, Antarctica, and most oceanic islands (Nowak 1999). Qiu and Schmidt-Kittler (1982) considered Leptarctinae to be a subfamily of mustelids including Craterogale (North America, Middle Miocene), Trocharion (Europe, Middle Miocene), Hypsoparia (North America, Upper Miocene), and Leptarctus (North America and Asia, Lower to Upper Miocene). Leptarctus ranges from basal Hemingfordian strata to the Early Hemphillian (Lim 1999). The characters diagnosing Leptarctus as a mustelid include absence of M2, absence of a notch between the paracone and the metacone of the upper carnassial, and a reduced dentition with loss of P1 and p1. Among mustelids, Leptarctus also has many unique characters, including prominent double sagittal crests, a well-developed hypocone on P4, grooved lower canines, heavy zygomatic arches, and bony projections on the tympanic bullae (Lim 1999). Dorr (1954) erected a new genus and species of leptarctine mustelid from the Late Miocene of Montana, USA: Hypsoparia bozemanensis. Qiu and Schmidt-Kittler (1982) confirmed it as a taxon separate from Leptarctus. However, McKenna and Bell (1997) and Baskin (1998) synonymized H. bozemanensis with Leptarctus primus. The new specimen from the Miocene of South Dakota, USA, provides evidence that Hypsoparia is a separate genus from Leptarctus. We can describe this animal as follows: Systematic paleontology: class, Mammalia; order, Carnivora; family, Mustelidae (Fischer von Waldheim 1817); subfamily, Leptarctinae (Gazin 1936); genus Hypsoparia (Dorr 1954). Emended diagnosis: the muzzle short, deep, and wide compared with that of Leptarctus; small, round infraorbital foramen; relatively greater height of zygomatic arch; upper canine with anterior wear; P2 and P3 unicuspid with complete cingula; P4 and M1 longer than wide; labial side longer than lingual side on P4; anterior margin of M1 curving inward; mandibles larger and more robust than in L. primus; mandible deep with two mental foramina located below p2 and p3; masseteric fossa enlarged; m2 longer than wide; m1 with a broadly basined talonid; p3 and p4 with prominent cingula.",
2613,"Exposure to drinking water trihalomethanes and nitrate and the risk of brain tumours in young people Brain tumours (BTs) are one of the most frequent tumour types in young people. We explored the association between tap water, exposure to trihalomethanes (THM) and nitrate and neuroepithelial BT risk in young people. Analysis of tap water consumption were based on 321 cases and 919 appendicitis controls (10-24 years old) from 6 of the 14 participating countries in the international MOBI-Kids case-control study (2010-2016). Available historical residential tap water concentrations of THMs and nitrate, available from 3 countries for 86 cases and 352 controls and 85 cases and 343 for nitrate, respectively, were modelled and combined with the study subjects' personal consumption patterns to estimate ingestion and residential exposure levels in the study population (both pre- and postnatal). The mean age of participants was 16.6 years old and 56% were male. The highest levels and widest ranges for THMs were found in Spain (residential and ingested) and Italy and in Korea for nitrate. There was no association between BT and the amount of tap water consumed and the showering/bathing frequency. Odds Ratios (ORs) for BT in relation to both pre- and postnatal residential and ingestion levels of THMs were systematically below 1 (ORÂ =Â 0.37 (0.08-1.73)) for postnatal average residential THMs higher than 66Â Î¼g/L. For nitrate, all ORs were above 1 (ORÂ =Â 1.80 (0.91-3.55)) for postnatal average residential nitrate levels higher than 8.5Â mg/L, with a suggestion of a trend of increased risk of neuroepithelial BTs with increasing residential nitrate levels in tap water, which appeared stronger in early in life. This, to our knowledge, is the first study on this topic in young people. Further research is required to clarify the observed associations.",

To achieve the goal of water security, particularly in rapidly expanding cities, identification of safe and sustainable water resources is an absolute necessity. The paper conducts an exploratory investigation in the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and thereby assesses the suitability of groundwater as an alternative and reliable resource for public water supply in the Indian city of Surat. A total of 33 groundwater samples, selected on the basis of aquifer depth and land use signatures, were collected from open, bore, dug wells and hand pumps. After the hydrogeochemical analysis, the study evaluated the present state of the groundwater quality and determined the spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters such as hardness, electrical conductivity, Cl-, pH, SO42- and NO(3)(-)concentrations. Based on the permeability index, result showed that 80% of the sampled groundwater quality falls under excellent class, i.e., category I with PI value ranging from 1 to 24%, whereas the rest 20% of the samples has fallen under good class, i.e., category II with PI value ranging from 25 to 75% on the suitability of water for irrigation. The results of this study outline the unsustainability of groundwater for direct consumption, especially without any improved on-site water treatment, but it is appropriate for the irrigation purposes.",
2615,"Observation of Excess Heavy Metal Concentrations in Water Resources to Infer Surface Water Influences on Shallow Groundwater: a Typical Example of the Porsuk River (Eskisehir-Turkey) The Eskisehir province is well-known due to its industrial and agricultural activities, which are a threat for the aquatic environment. Hence, monitoring of water quality in the area is of vital importance because of an excess heavy metal contents, especially As. The Porsuk River is heavily polluted by industrial activities from Kutahya city. It discharges into the Porsuk Dam and from there it flows relatively clean to Eskisehir city center, but beyond this point it increasingly deteriorates due to the negative impact of industrial and agricultural activities up to the junction point of Porsuk and Sakarya rivers. Heavy metal concentrations and As contents in surface and ground waters were selected as pollution indicators to examine pollution level and compare an interaction between river and groundwater. For this purpose, water samples taken between 2008 and 2010 from the Porsuk River along the section from the west of Kutahya to the discharge point into the Sakarya River, as well as groundwater samples from the wells located close to or far of the Porsuk River, were evaluated. Based on the obtained results, we found that the Porsuk River, especially at the locations close to the Sakarya River, and groundwater are polluted in terms of heavy metals and As compounds. In conclusion, the heavy metal and As pollution is also observed in the wells close to the locations in which groundwater is fed by the Porsuk River since it acts as an influent river. Thus, surface water is considered as a polluting source of groundwater.",
2616,"Effect of degree of polish on milling and nutritive qualities of some Kenyan wheat varieties and triticale T222 variety The degree of polishing is one of the most important quality control factor of a coreal since over-milling conserves less flour and uneconomical while under-milling provides flours of poor quality. Investigation was carried out with four groups of wheat and one triticale variety developed in Kenya at three different polishing time to fulfil the interest of millers and the consumers. Popo (Gr. I), Chiriku (Cr. II), Kwale (Gr. III) and Mbuni (Gr. IV) wheat varieties and triticale T222 were milled for 15, 20, and 30 minutes. There was no significant difference (P<0.05) in milling quality for most of the wheat varieties and T222 with respect to degree of milling; however significant difference between milling time, percent germ and percent flour extraction were observed in most of the varieties. While analysing the total proteins in various parts of wheat grain, 20 minutes of polishing time was found to be the most suitable for all samples to retain the optimum amount of protein. Significant (P<0.05) difference in protein content was observed at every polishing time among all the wheat varieties and T222. All the wheat varieties absorbed appreciable amount of water (ABPT=00%) and above, irrespective of polishing time while T222 absorbed slightly less (56%) water. The quality parameters involving gluten content, farinograph tests, baking volumes, inferred that 20 minutes of polishing time was the best for all the varieties. At this time Baking Volume (BV) was highest (803 ml) for Kwale, equally good (773 ml) for Popo, fairly well (670 ml) for Chiriku while the respective flour extraction values (FE %) were around 66% for Popo and Kwale, nearly 69% for Chiriku. Mbuni having least FE% (64%) absorbed highest water (68%) although expanded least (BV=625 nil) indicating some influence of environment and genetic factors on its final quality. Gluten content of all the wheat varieties was fairly high (4%) accounting for their desirable baking strength. Finally the quality rating scale inferred that Kwale and Chiriku were the best wheat varieties at consumers and millers levels respectively, although all the varieties possessed desirable qualities. T222 performed poorly at both the levels.",
2617,"Numerical simulation on borehole breakout and borehole size effect using discrete element method Estimation of horizontal stress magnitudes from borehole breakouts has been an attractive topic in the petroleum and mining industries, although there are critical research gaps that remain unfilled. In this paper, numerical simulation is conducted on Gosford sandstone to investigate the borehole breakout and its associated borehole size effect, including temperature influence. The discrete element method (DEM) model shows that the borehole breakout angular span is constant after the initial formation, whereas its depth propagates along the minimum horizontal stress direction. This indicates that the breakout angular span is a reliable parameter for horizontal stress estimation. The borehole size effect simulations illustrated the importance of borehole size on breakout geometries in which smaller borehole size leads to higher breakout initiation stress as well as the stress re-distribution from borehole wall outwards through micro-cracking. This implies that the stress may be averaged over a distance around the borehole and breakout initiation occurs at the borehole wall rather than some distance into the rock. In addition, the numerical simulation incorporated the thermal effect which is widely encountered in deep geothermal wells. Based on the results, the higher temperature led to lower breakout initiation stress with same borehole size, and more proportion of shear cracks was generated under higher temperature. This indicates that the temperature might contribute to the micro-fracturing mode and hence influences the horizontal stress estimation results from borehole breakout geometries. Numerical simulation showed that breakout shape and dimensions changed considerably under high stress and high temperature conditions, suggesting that the temperature may need to be considered for breakout stress analysis in deep locations.

2618,"Multivariate and Spatial Analysis of Physicochemical Parameters in an Irrigation District, Chihuahua, Mexico Water quality is relevant due to the complexity of the interaction of physicochemical and biological parameters. The Irrigation District 005 (ID005) is one of the most important agricultural region in Chihuahua, Mexico; for that reason, it was proposed to investigate the water quality of the site. Water samples were collected in two periods: Summer (S1) and Fall (S2). The samples were taken from 65 wells in S1, and 54 wells in S2. Physicochemical parameters (PhP) such as Arsenic (As), Temperature, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Oxide Reduction Potential (ORP), Hardness, pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Turbidity were analyzed. The data were subjected to statistical principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA) and spatial variability tests. In both seasons, the TDS exceeded the Mexican maximum permissible level (MPL) (35% S1, 39% S2). Turbidity exceeded the MPL in S1 (29%) and in S2 (12%). Arsenic was above the MPL for water of agricultural use in 9% (S1) and 13% (S2) of the wells. The PCA results suggested that most variations in water quality in S1 were due to As, pH and Temperature, followed by EC, TDS and Hardness; while in S2 to EC, TDS and Hardness, followed by As and pH.",
2619,"Seasonal drought forecasting for Latin America using the ECMWF S4 forecast system Meaningful seasonal prediction of drought conditions is key information for end-users and water managers, particularly in Latin America where crop and livestock production are key for many regional economies. However, there are still not many studies of the feasibility of such a forecasts at continental level in the region. In this study, precipitation predictions from the European Centre for MediumRangeWeather (ECMWF) seasonal forecast systemS4 are combined with observed precipitation data to generate forecasts of the standardized precipitation index (SPI) for Latin America, and their skill is evaluated over the hindcast period 1981-2010. The value-added utility in using the ensemble S4 forecast to predict the SPI is identified by comparing the skill of its forecasts with a baseline skill based solely on their climatological characteristics. As expected, skill of the S4-generated SPI forecasts depends on the season, location, and the specific aggregation period considered (the 3- and 6-month SPI were evaluated). Added skill from the S4 for lead times equaling the SPI accumulation periods is primarily present in regions with high intra-annual precipitation variability, and is found mostly for the months at the end of the dry seasons for 3-month SPI, and half-yearly periods for 6-month SPI. The ECMWF forecast system behaves better than the climatology for clustered grid points in theNorth of South America, theNortheast of Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil and Mexico. The skillful regions are similar for the SPI3 and -6, but become reduced in extent for the severest SPI categories. Forecasting different magnitudes of meteorological drought intensity on a seasonal time scale still remains a challenge. However, the ECMWF S4 forecasting system does capture the occurrence of drought events for the aforementioned regions and seasons reasonably well. In the near term, the largest advances in the prediction of meteorological drought for Latin America are obtainable fromimprovements in near-real-time precipitation observations for the region. In the longer term, improvements in precipitation forecast skill from dynamical models, like the fifth generation of the ECMWF seasonal forecasting system, will be essential in this effort.

2620,"Morphological and molecular characterization of Acanthamoeba isolated from contact lens paraphernalia in Malaysia: Highlighting the pathogenic potential of T4 genotype Objective: To determine the morphological and molecular characterization of Acanthamoeba isolates from contact lens paraphernalia in Malaysia and to investigate their pathogenic potential based on the physiological tolerance. Methods: One hundred and eighty contact lens wearers donated their contact lens, lens storage cases and lens solutions between 2018 and 2019. The samples were inoculated onto 1.5% non-nutrient agar plates for 14 d. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed and the amplified PCR products were sequenced and compared with the published sequences in GenBank. The pathogenic potential of positive isolates was further tested using temperature-tolerance and osmo-tolerance assays. Acanthamoeba species were categorized into three distinct morphological groups established by Pussard and Pons. Results: Acanthamoeba was successfully isolated from 14 (7.8%) culture-positive samples in which 11 belong to morphological group II and 3 belong to morphological group III, respectively. The sequencing of 18S ribosomal RNA gene led to the identification of the T4 genotype in all the isolated strains. In vitro assays revealed that 9 (64.3%) Acanthamoeba isolates were able to grow at 42 degrees C and 1 M mannitol and were thus considered to be highly pathogenic. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report identifying the Acanthamoeba genotype and their pathogenic potential among contact lens wearers in Malaysia. The potentially pathogenic T4 genotype isolated in this study is the most predominant genotype responsible for human ocular infection worldwide. Hence, increasing attention should be aimed at the prevention of contamination by Acanthamoeba and the disinfection of contact lens paraphernalia.",
2621,"Intelligent optimization of a hybrid renewable energy system-powered water desalination unit The use of renewable energies for pumping and desalination of seawater and/or brackish water can be a viable solution to reach a more sustainable freshwater production and reduce environmental impacts. In this way, a new approach based on the design of experiment method for optimal sizing a stand-alone solar-wind-reverse osmosis desalination system is investigated. For this, system modelling is presented with the development of a single sizing parameter between desalination motor pump and reverse osmosis unit and a dynamic simulator of the proposed energy-water system with its energy management loop is developed using climatology year data of southern Tunisia. In optimization loop, the methodology with one-year dynamic simulation necessarily leads to very long convergence times of several days. To try to reduce this time, a track has been proposed which consists in using meta-models instead of dynamic simulators. In order to apply this track, a meta-model (hybrid spline) that represents the system constraints and objectives is investigated based on design of experiments tool and a bi-objective genetic algorithm is applied in the optimization process via the developed meta-model. Two objective functions are used: loss of power supply probability (reliability indicator) which is used to present the dissatisfaction of the water production and embodied energy (environmental indicator) which is used to compute energetic cost (MJ) and to evaluate the environmental impacts potential (across the whole life cycle). Optimal sizing of the system via meta-models instead of dynamic simulator led to encouraging results with significantly reduced CPU times (from several days to 13 min). Graphic abstract",
2622,"An approach to computing topographic wetness index based on maximum downslope gradient As an important topographic attribute widely-used in precision agriculture, topographic wetness index (TWI) is designed to quantify the effect of local topography on hydrological processes and for modeling the spatial distribution of soil moisture and surface saturation. This index is formulated as TWI = ln(a/tan beta), where a is the upslope contributing area per unit contour length (or Specific Catchment Area, SCA) and tan beta is the local slope gradient for estimating a hydraulic gradient. The computation of both a and tan beta need to reflect impacts of local terrain on local drainage. Many of the existing flow direction algorithms for computing a use global parameters, which lead to unrealistic partitioning of flow. beta is often approximated by slope gradient around the pixel. In fact, the downslope gradient of the pixel is a better approximation of beta. This paper examines how TWI is impacted by a multiple flow routing algorithm adaptive to local terrain and the employment of maximum downslope gradient as beta. The adaptive multiple flow routing algorithm partitions flow by altering the flow partition parameter based on local maximum downslope gradient. The proposed approach for computing TWI is quantitatively evaluated using four types of artificial terrains constructed as DEMs with a series of resolutions (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m), respectively. The result shows that the error of TWI computed using the proposed approach is generally lower than that of TWI by the widely used approach. The new approach was applied to a low-relief agricultural catchment (about 60 km(2)) in the Nenjiang watershed, Northeastern China. The results of this application show that the distribution of TWI by the proposed approach reflects local terrain conditions better.",
2623,"Application of a flocculation-ultrafiltration process for bacteria (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) removal from industrial plant process water The treatment of well-water containing bacteria (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) used as process (cooling) water at the glass manufacturing plant in Mersin, Turkey has been studied in order to remove bacteria in suspension by coagulation/flocculation followed by ultrafiltration. Using a jar-test procedure, physico-chemical conditions have been optimised. Among the different types of additives investigated, a particular type of polyacrylamide (Magnafloc 1011, very high molecular weight anionic) resulted in a 65.22% bacteria removal from the well-water at a dosage of 0.01 g/l, while the combined use of flocculation and ultrafiltration methods achieved bacteria removal of 89.85% from the well-water.

2624,"Effects of a 25-year application of treated wastewater on soil properties of Cebala-Borj Touil irrigated perimeter (North Tunisia) In arid and semi-arid areas, the reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) is one of the solutions to the problem of water scarcity. Nevertheless, this resource may represent some risks to the environment and human health. In Tunisia, the use of TWW for irrigation has started since the sixties but its impact on soil quality is still not well understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of long-term irrigation with TWW on soil properties of Cebala-Borj Touil irrigated perimeter (North Tunisia). The studied soil is a fluvisol irrigated for 25 years with TWW. Water used for irrigation presents a high organic load, an alkaline pH and a relatively high salinity (3.73 mS/cm) but with trace metals concentration which does not exceed Tunisian and FAO standards. Two profiles were digged: P1 represents the soil irrigated with TWW and P2 is the control (non-irrigated soil). Soil samples were taken from each horizon and analyzed for their granulometric composition, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), trace metal elements (TME) and total organic matter (OM) content. Soil color and structure were equally described. The comparison of the two profiles showed that the irrigated soil presented a lighter color, a different structure and a slightly finer texture, mainly in surface layers, than the control. Besides, an acidification of soil surface and a problem of salinization/sodication accompanied with an OM accumulation in soil deep horizons were observed. TME concentrations were under the detection limit except for Mn, which showed an increase in the top horizon of P1 as compared to P2. Results show that the soil properties were seriously affected after 25-years irrigation with TWW, which must be improved by some management measures.",
2625,"Potential of trihalomethanes formation in the domestic water sources of Jericho area / west bank The process of water chlorination to the water contains a considerable amount of TOC can lead to the figuration of some Ï€-products that are highly harmful to human health. Among all the chlorination Ï€-products, trihalomethanes (THMs) is exhibit highly carcinogenic activity. This study tries to identify the main factors that play a critical role in the THM formation and control its mechanisms at different stages. (WHO) usually measure free residual chlorine values at levels less than the recommended values. The concentrations of THMs formed in the water network vary depending on the concentration of TOC in the discharged spring water, and the chlorine dose plays an important role in this process by increasing the contact time. The THM levels in the tap water of Jericho and Aqbat Jabber camp are at levels below the USEPA limit of 80Î¼g/L, as well as the WHO limit of 100 Î¼g/L. CHBr3 was found to be the major contributor to the total THMs. CHCl3 found to be the dominant sort detected after the chlorination of each sample in the experiment. The THM detected at high-temperature incubation were higher than the low-temperature ones for all of the samples. Â© 2020 University Mohammed Premier Oujda.",
2626,"Species assemblages and community structure of adult caddisflies along a headwater stream in southeastern Ghana (Insecta : Trichoptera) Adult caddisflies were collected at 12 sites along a 5 km stretch of a forested headwater stream in southeastern Ghana in March and November 1993 and the catches are related to environmental variables. Some 34,000 specimens, belonging to 178 morphospecies in 43 genera and 11 families, were caught with Malaise traps and light traps. Many species demonstrate differences between sampling method, seasonal occurrence, and sex-ratios, with the light trap in the second wet sunny season (November) being most efficient with respect to the diversity of the catches. A Moran index analysis for global structures indicates a major transition in the fauna from the ravine with waterfalls to the forest, and secondly, a gradient through the forest. A Geary index analysis for local structures indicates further faunal turnovers in the lower reaches of the stream. Species-environment relationships were analyzed through correspondence analysis and co-inertia analysis, allowing ordination of both species and the environment into three zones. The first co-inertia axis reveals a transition between the waterfalls in the open ravine (sites 1-3), and the stream through the riverine forest (sites 4-12), while the second co-inertia axis reveals a gradient from the lotic stream in the moist semi-deciduous forest (sites 4-8) to more lentic stretches of the stream in a gradually more depleted forest (sites 9-12). The most important environmental factors related to the species transition are: riparian moss growth (r = 0.94), leaves in the stream substratum (r = 0.91), forest type (r = 0.90), hygropetric surfaces (r = 0.88), bedrock (r = 0.87), lotic [riffle] (r = 0.85) and lentic [pool] (r = 0.85) stretches. The most important environmental factors related to the species gradient are: lotic [riffle] stretches (r = 0.92), gravel (r = 0.88) and leaves (r = 0.85) in the stream substratum, forest type (r = 0.81), and agricultural use (r = 0.76). Three clusters representing three major environmental zones (zone I, II and III) along the stream are identified by projecting the average species positions on the co-inertia plane. By analyzing the Malaise trap samples significant indicator values are found for 29 species in zone 1, 16 species in zone H, and 18 species in zone Ill. By analyzing the light trap samples significant indicator values are found for 17 species in zone 1, 57 species in zone H, and 38 species in zone Ill. The high diversity of caddisflies in the sanctuary might be reflected both in the geological and climatological history of West Africa, as well as in the recognition of three major environmental zones, and the clean water with high diversity of stream microhabitats favorable for Trichoptera larvae. The closed forest seems to play an important role for the Trichoptera community, and the study demonstrates the importance of protecting forested headwater streams in order to maintain a sustainable aquatic biodiversity in tropical Africa.",
2627,"Development of water reclamation technology in South Africa In South Africa, full-scale research on the technology of reclamation of drinking-water from wastewater was focused on two 4,500 m**3/d plants. The Stander water reclamation plant, Pretoria, served as a research demonstration facility, initially treating biofilter humus tank effluent, which necessitated high lime treatment and ammonia stripping. Research findings and process development at the SRP were implemented to modify the Windhoek water reclamation plant, which was originally designed for maturation pond effluent after conventional biofilter treatment. Activated sludge secondary effluent which became available at both sites ensured low residuals of ammonia. The high lime process was successfully replaced by coagulation with metal salts at both plants, with the application of interstage chlorination between the two clarification stages. This process modification significantly improved operating costs and simplified operational control. Refs. In South Africa, full-scale research on the technology of reclamation of drinking-water from wastewater was focused on two 4,500 m3/d plants. The Stander water reclamation plant (SRP), Pretoria, served as a research demonstration facility, initially treating biofilter humus tank effluent, which necessitated high lime treatment and ammonia stripping. Research findings and process development at the SRP were implemented to modify the Windhoek water reclamation plant (WRP), which was originally designed for maturation pond effluent after conventional biofilter treatment. High ammonia concentrations as a result of progressive overloading of the sewage works hampered continuous production of reclaimed water. Activated sludge secondary effluent which became available at both sites ensured low residuals of ammonia and a higher quality effluent more suitable for reclamation purposes. The high lime process was successfully replaced by coagulation with metal salts at both plants, with the application of interstage chlorination between the two clarification stages. This process modification significantly improved operating costs and simplified operational control. Results obtained over a 12-month period for the Windhoek plant form the main subject of this paper.",
2628,"The impact of mariculture on nutrient dynamics and identification of the nitrate sources in coastal waters Reclamation along coastal zones is a method that has been used to relieve the problems of strained resources and land. Aquaculture, as one of the major man-made activities in reclamation areas, has an environmental impact on coastal waters. The effluents from aquaculture ponds are known to enrich the levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate. The goals of the present study are to evaluate the environmental impact of mariculture on coastal waters in the east coast of Laizhou Bay, China, and to identify the nitrate sources. Monitoring the concentrations of dissolved nitrogen and phosphate was used to assess their impact on the water quality of coastal waters. A dual isotope (Î´(15)N-NO3(-) and Î´(18)O-NO3(-)) approach was used to identify the nitrate sources. Higher dissolved nitrogen concentrations (NH4(+) and NO3(-)) than PO4(3-) concentrations associated with enriched Î´(15)N-NO3(-) values were observed in the drainage channels, sea cucumber ponds, and groundwater, which indicated that aquaculture activity has more influence on nitrogen nutrients than on phosphate nutrients. In this coastal area with seawater intrusion, nitrogen released from sea cucumber ponds accumulated in nearshore water and migrated in the offshore direction in groundwater currents. This behavior results in nitrogen enrichment in groundwater within the hinterland. Isotopic data indicate that mixing of multiple nitrate sources exists in groundwater, and nitrogen from mariculture is the main source.",
2629,"Origin of the Eocene porphyries and mafic microgranular enclaves from the Beiya porphyry Au polymetallic deposit, western Yunnan, China: Implications for magma mixing/mingling and mineralization The origin of magmas with high H2O, S and metals that are linked to porphyry economic mineralization in continental collisional belts is controversial. In this paper, we studied the host porphyries and associated microgranular enclaves (MMEs) including gabbroic enclaves and dioritic enclaves fromthe large Beiya porphyry Au deposit in Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan mineralization belt, which provide first hand evidence of crust-mantle hybridization in the formation of fertile magma for porphyry deposit. Zircon LA-ICPMS U-Pb ages indicate coeval formation for theMMEs and the felsic porphyries in Eocene time (similar to 36Ma). The MMEs show spheroidal shapes, acicular apatites, and oscillatory zoningwith repeated resorption surfaces in plagioclases, which suggest that the MMEs are globules of a more mafic magma that was injected into and mingled with the host felsic magma. One gabbroic enclave sample exhibits high MgO (5.6 wt.%), high TiO2 (1.7 wt.%), enriched in large-ion lithophile element (LILE) and depleted in high field strength element (HFSE), with negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies. This indicates that the gabbroic enclave is similar to those of the coeval potassic mafic rocks in theWestern Yunnan, which originated fromthe enriched mantlemetasomatized by the slab-derived fluids. The dioritic enclave exhibit both potassic and adakitic-like features, and are characterized by high contents of MgO (4.4-4.9 wt.%), K2O (6.4-7.4 wt.%), and compatible trace elements (e. g. Ni: 115-142 ppm; Cr: 214-291 ppm), as well as by high Sr/Y ratios. The dioritic enclave samples yield eHf (t) values (-1.9 to + 3.6) similar to those of the host porphyries. Petrographic, elemental, and isotopic evidence suggests that the Beiya dioritic enclave were formed by mixing between potassic mafic and adakitc-like melts, derived from metasomatized lithospheric mantle and lower crust, respectively. In contrast, the Beiya host porphyries are characterized by high SiO2 (66.9-71.9 wt.%) and Al2O3 (13.8-15.9 wt.%) contents, high Sr/Y ratios (35-79), low compatible element contents (e. g. Ni = 0.9-7.2 ppm; Cr = 1.0-8.2 ppm), low Mg# values (0.19-0.35), positive LILE anomalies, marked negative high HFSE anomalies, negative eNd(t) values (-6 to-2), and high (Sr-87/(86S) r) i values (0.7071-0.7081). These features indicate that the host porphyriesweremainly formed by partial melting of subduction-modified lower crustwith a certain assimilation of mafic melts represented by MMEs. MMEs hosted in the Beiya porphyries, formed from a hydrous, mafic magma although they formed in a non-arc setting. High magmatic water content is probably related to an enriched mantle metasomatized by fluids from a Proterozoic subducted oceanic slab. High Cu (341-626 ppm) and Au contents of the MMEs suggest they crystallized from a metal-rich mafic melt. Complex assemblages of pyrite-chalcopyrite-apatite-rutile with hornblende are observed in the least altered MME. We suggest that the mafic melt probably supplied part of water, and metal to the Beiya porphyry Au system. (C) 2016 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

2630,"Development of a sensitive polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii in water Toxoplasma gondii is becoming a potential threat for public water supplies worldwide, as demonstrated by the occurrence of waterborne toxoplasmosis outbreaks in developing countries as well as industrialised countries. The aim of the present study was to develop a sensitive molecular approach (PCR) for the detection of Toxoplasma oocysts in water. Sporulated and unsporulated T. gondii oocysts (strains DX and AHC1) were isolated from faeces of laboratory-infected cats. After purification and enumeration, oocysts were spiked into 1-L water replicates and concentrated using centrifugation, Al-2(SO4)(3) or Fe-2(SO4)(3) flocculation. DNA was extracted from the concentrated pellets, and a universal primer and a T. gondii-specific primer were selected to amplify a region at the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. A theoretical detection limit of 0.1 oocysts was achieved for samples that had been concentrated using centrifugation or Al-2(SO4)(3) flocculation. No PCR products were generated for samples that had been pretreated using Fe-2(SO4)(3) flocculation. The final target would be the development of a complete technique able to work as a diagnostic tool for the detectior of Toxoplasma in environmental and drinking water.",
2631,"Assessing water security across the Krishna River Basin The Krishna River Basin covers an area of 258,000 km(2) (nearly 8% of India) in three large states-Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh-with a combined basin population of 70 million. Water extractions for agriculture, industrial, and domestic uses continue to grow to support one of the fastest developing regions of peninsular India. The basin is facing acute water shortages which are leading to interstate conflicts on the allocation and use of the resource. Intense competition for water between urban, industry and agriculture is going to aggravate due to rapid economic growth of the region. This research attempts to capture the current trends of key drivers of water demand and assess their implications on future water demand. The assessment uses the PODIUMSIM model for projecting basin's water future. The PODIUMSIM, the Policy Dialogue Model, is a tool for simulating the alternative scenarios of water future with respect to the variation of food and water demand drivers. The model integrates both ""Water demand and supply"" and ""food demand and supply"" and hence provides a framework for addressing water and food security issues. This model was used to simulate future water demand for 12 sub-basins of Krishna Basin in India to look at the level at which future demand can be met using different levels of the security of water supply. The approach taken was a sub-basin approach to try to capture spatial variations within the basin. Results from the projections show that there is a huge discrepancy between the water supply and demand of different sub-basins in Krishna. The water demand for irrigation will increase from 34 km(3) in 2001 to 43 km(3) and that Krishna will be highly dependent for outside food by 2031. Population growth was found to be the main drivers of domestic water demand. At a basin level, the deficit in water supply for Lower Krishna and the high surplus volume in Upper Krishna would have been masked by averages. Change in consumption pattern will lead to an increasing deficit for non-grain crops whereas increasing water productivity is very much essential to meet the needs in the future. Most sub-basins are unable to meet environmental flow requirements and climate change will increase water demands significantly in future, mainly through the agriculture sector. From this research, it was concluded that Krishna's water future requires dramatic policy changes to ensure that the people continue to have sufficient amount of water for their daily needs",
2632,"Cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Atitlan, Guatemala Lake Atitlan, one of the most important lakes not only in Central America but in the whole world, is facing serious problems with increasing water pollution. Over the last several decades, the uncontrolled nutrient input into the lake has lead to high P levels and low N:P ratios, initiating cyanobacterial blooms. The first bloom occurred in December of 2008, followed by more extensive bloom in October 2009. The blooms are formed by cyanobacteria from the rare planktic Lyngbya hieronymusii/birgei/robusta complex. Based on the species morphology, the Atitlan population corresponds to L. robusta and this is the first case of reported bloom of this species worldwide. Remote sensing images documented that at the maximum bloom development, 40% of the 137 km(2) of the lake area were covered by dense patches of Lyngbya, with the chlorophyll a concentration reaching over 100 mu g L-1. The only toxins detected in the 2009 bloom were trace levels of cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin with 12 and 58 ng g(-1), respectively. The nitrogen fixation followed a pattern expected in non-heterocytous cyanobacteria, i.e., the nitrogenase activity was minimal during the day, while during the night the activity reached 2.2 nmol C2H4 mu g Ch a(-1) h(-1). Delta N-15 of 0.86% was well in the range given for nitrogen fixing organisms. The cell C, N and P content was 36.7%, 5.9% and 0.9%, respectively, resulting in the molar ratio of 105:14.4:1. A well designed and executed lake monitoring program, strict control of nutrient input into the lake, and public education are the necessary prerequisites for potential prevention of even more severe blooms than the one from 2009.

2633,"Temporal variability and covariance structures of soil temperature in a sugarcane field under different management practices in southern Brazil Extreme soil thermal regimes adversely affect soil functioning and reduce crop productivity. Thus, there is the need to understand the extent which soil tillage and mulching can modify extreme soil temperature conditions for optimum crop growth and productivity. The objective of this study was to investigate the residual effect of tillage and introduction of straw mulching on the temporal variability and covariance structures of soil temperature of a sugarcane field in southern Brazil during the 2011/2012 growing season. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD), with split-plot arrangement in three replications. The main treatment consisted of no tillage (NT), chiseling (Chi), compacted no tillage (NTC) and conventional tillage (CT) imposed a year before this study while the sub-plots (new treatments) were straw mulching and no mulching of previous sugarcane trash. Soil bulk density was determined at the middle of soil layers 0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm using the core method. Soil water content (SWC) and temperature were monitored at the middle of soil layers,0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm, respectively in each treatment using TDR and copper-constantan sensors. Soil water content was measured manually while soil temperature data was recorded automatically every thirty (30) minutes. BD was highest (1.76 g cm(-3)) in the 10-20 cm layer of NTC treatment. SWC was lower in the surface layer of all tillage treatments, while straw mulch plots exhibited higher SWC values. Higher average, maximum, minimum and amplitude of soil surface temperature were observed in NTC and NT treatments. Straw mulching significantly influenced the soil thermal regime, as it suppressed the maximum soil surface temperature by 11 degrees C and the average daily temperature by about 4 degrees C during the critical summer period. During the critical winter season, daily average and maximum soil temperatures increased by about 3 and 4 degrees C by straw mulch, respectively. Straw mulching influenced temporal covariance structure of soil temperature. Applied statistical time series analysis of daily soil temperature used certain proportion of previous observations, gave higher coefficient of determination as well as being able to incorporate measurement and model errors, making it better than the corresponding classical linear regression procedure. This study showed that straw mulching could mitigate deleterious effects of supra-optimal temperature and protect the soil from sub-zero thermal conditions during the extreme summer and winter periods, respectively.

2634,"Analysis of spatio-temporal variability of surface-groundwater interactions in the Gharehsoo river basin, Iran, using a coupled SWAT-MODFLOW model Although groundwater and surface water are often treated as individual water compartments in hydrological cycle studies, they essentially originate from one source. Such a split approach restricts the optimal usages of these water resources in several water management applications. The present study aims to shed light on the complex interaction of surface-groundwater interactions in terms of groundwater recharge from drainage network towards the adjacent aquafer and conversely, groundwater discharge from the aquifer towards the drainage network in the Gharehsoo River Basin (GRB), with the enclosed Ardabil aquifer, located in northwest Iran. To that end, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), as the surface hydrological model was fully coupled with the latest version of the Modular Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference Groundwater Flow (MODFLOW-NWT) (Newton-Raphson Technique to improve the solutions of unconfined groundwater-flow problems). The total study period, i.e. 1978-2012 was split into two intervals for calibration (1988-2012) and validation (1978-1987). To facilitate and expedite the calibration of the coupled model, first we calibrated SWAT and MODFLOW-NWT independently against the observed streamflow and groundwater head time series, respectively. Afterwards, we recalibrated the coupled model SWAT-MODFLOW. To link these two models, the surface and sub-surface water flow components are exchanged between the Disaggregated Hydrological Response Units (DHRUs) of SWAT with the MODFLOW-NWT' grid cells. In addition, three more flow components are sequentially exchanged: the deep percolation from SWAT to MODFLOW-NWT, baseflow/groundwater discharge from MODFLOW-NWT to SWAT, and the river heads from SWAT to MODFLOW-NWT. The results of the application show that the coupled model satisfactorily, quantified by R(2)0.5, simulates streamflow and particularly, groundwater heads. In fact, both observations and simulations indicate that, owing to an ongoing overexploitation of the aquifer, heads havebeen decreased steadily over the studied period which has led to a parallel decline of the groundwater storage. Moreover, the analysis of the stream-aquifer exchange flows indicates that groundwater discharge towards the stream-network (effluent conditions) is orders of magnitude higher than the opposite process (influent conditions). In addition, findings reveal that many of the tributaries across the GRB have shifted from a perennial regime to ephemeral/intermittent system over the past decades. The provided and well-tested coupled model would be a viable asset to assess a wide range of plausible scenarios to identify most effective and practical water resource management schemes to recover the severely depleted surface water and groundwater resources of the GRB.",
2635,"Tracking nitrate sources in the Chaohu Lake, China, using the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic approach The Chaohu Lake is highly polluted and suffers from severe eutrophication. Nitrate is a key form of nitrogen that can cause water quality degradation. In this study, hydrochemical and dual isotopic approaches were utilized to identify the seasonal variation of nitrate sources in the Chaohu Lake and its inflowing rivers. The average nitrate concentrations ([NO(3)(-)]) of the lake and its inflowing rivers were 89.9 and 140.8Â Î¼molÂ L(-1), respectively. The isotopic values of Î´(15)N-NO(3)(-) and Î´(18)O-NO(3)(-) in the lake ranged from -â€‰1.01 to +â€‰16.67â€° and from -â€‰4.39 to +â€‰22.20â€°, respectively. The two major rivers had distinct isotopic compositions, with average Î´(15)N-NO(3)(-) values of +â€‰17.52 and +â€‰3.51â€°, and average Î´(18)O-NO(3)(-) values of +â€‰2.71 and +â€‰7.47â€° for the Nanfei River and Hangbu River, respectively. The results show that soil organic ammonium and urban wastewater discharge were the main sources of nitrate in the Chaohu Lake, and nitrate assimilation was an important process affected [NO(3)(-)] and isotopic compositions, especially in the western Chaohu Lake. The elevated [NO(3)(-)] and Î´(15)N-NO(3)(-) values in the western Chaohu Lake indicate the high influence of human activities. Urban wastewater discharge was the primary nitrate source in the Nanfei River and soil organic ammonium was the main source in the Hangbu River. Although nitrate from direct atmospheric deposition was low, its strong flushing effect can substantially improve riverine [NO(3)(-)] and nitrate loading from terrestrial ecosystem. The relatively high nitrate fluxes from the Hangbu River indicate that nitrogen loading from agricultural watershed is unneglectable in watershed nitrogen sources reduction strategies.",
2636,"Human exposure to uranium in South African gold mining areas using barber-based hair sampling Uranium (U) measurements in water, soil, and food related to gold mining activities in populated areas in Gauteng Province, South Africa, suggest the possibility of exposure levels that may lead to adverse health consequences, including cancer. Theoretical considerations on pathways of human uptake of significant exposures are plausible, but few data on directly measured human exposure are available. A cross-sectional study was conducted using human measurements to compare U levels with other settings around the globe (based on literature review), to explore potential exposure variability within the province, and to test the feasibility of recruiting subjects partially coming from vulnerable and difficult-to-reach populations. Wards of potentially high (HE) and low exposure (LE) were identified. Composite hair samples representing the respective local populations were collected from regular customers of selected barber shops over a period of 1-2 months. A total of 70 U concentrations were determined in 27 composite samples from 1332 individuals. U concentrations ranged from 31 mu g/kg to 2524 mu g/kg, with an arithmetic mean of 192 mu g/kg (standard deviation, 310 mu g/kg) and a median of 122 mu g/kg. Although HE wards collectively showed higher U levels than LE wards (184 vs 134 mu g/kg), differences were smaller than expected. In conclusion, detected U levels were higher than those from most other surveys of the general public. The barber-based approach was an efficient hair collection approach. Composite hair samples are not recommended, due to technical challenges in measuring U, and individual hair samples are needed in follow-up studies to determine predictors of exposure.",
2637,"Correlation between water fluoride levels and dental caries in Davangere District, India Areas with natural fluoride in the drinking water are natural laboratories where the effect of fluoride on dental caries can be studied in a real life situation. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of dental caries and to study its correlation with fluoride in the drinking water in Davangere District. 1128 school children in the age groups of 12 and 15 years from 12 villages with different concentrations of fluoride in drinking water were studied. Ion Selective electrode method (Orion, USA) was used to estimate Fluoride concentrations in drinking water. Dentition Status (WHO, 1997) was used to assess dental caries status. Results showed that there was a significant trend towards reduction in dental caries with increase in water fluoride levels. A negative correlation between fluoride levels and mean DMFT was seen among the subjects with the Karl Pearson's Correlation Co efficient being -0.65 and -0.72 for the 12 and 15 year olds respectively. It was concluded from the study that although dental caries was negatively associated with increasing fluoride levels, the problem of attendant dental fluorosis should also be considered seriously.",
2638,"Impact assessment of long treated wastewater irrigation on soil and crops in Algeria Water deficiency has become a critical problem in the Mediterranean region due to increases in population and industrial activities and increasing demand for irrigation water. The reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation can contribute towards alleviating the challenge of sufficient irrigation water, but irrigation with TWW can over time influence several soil parameters, such as physico-chemical properties and microbial activities. The aim of this study was to determine soil quality in agricultural fields to the north of Corso, Boumerdes Province, Algeria following the use of TWW for irrigation for 5 and 11 years. The results show an accumulation of salts and some heavy metals (Hg, Cu, Ni) in some soil horizons of the sample plots irrigated by TWW, as well as a reduction in certain microflora populations (Clostridiumsulfate reducers and members of the coliform group of bacteria). The levels of Cd, Cr, Co and Fe did not seem to be affected by TWW irrigation. These results suggest that to avoid possible soil contamination and risks to microflora populations, the quality of the TWW must be checked regularly according to the relevant standards for water reuse.",
2639,"The elimination of trace arsenic via hollow fiber supported liquid membrane: experiment and mathematical model This work presents the elimination of arsenic ions from synthetic produced water via hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM). Results demonstrate that arsenic ions in synthetic wastewater can be successfully treated to meet the wastewater standard as formulated by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Thailand. The discharged limit of arsenic from industrial wastewater must not be greater than 250Â ppb. In a single-step operation, arsenic ions are extracted and stripped. Percentages of extraction and stripping proved to be 100% and 98%, respectively. Optimum conditions found proved to be 0.68Â M Aliquat 336 dissolved in toluene as the liquid membrane, at pH 12 of feed solution, having a mixture of HCl and thiourea as the synergistic strippant, and flow rates of both feed and strippant solutions of 100Â mL/min. A mathematical model, developed to predict the final concentration of arsenic ions in feed and strippant solutions, is seen to fit in well with the experimental results.",
2640,"Intrinsic soil property effects on Cd phytotoxicity to Ligustrum japonicum 'Howardii' expressed as different fractions of Cd in forest soils A better comprehensive understanding of the influence of soil/solution properties on cadmium (Cd) phytotoxicity is essential for soil Cd ecological risk assessment. The toxicity of soil spiked Cd to Ligustrum japonicum 'Howardii' seedling growth was conducted by the greenhouse pot experiments using 13 typical forest soils selected from mainland of China. The results showed that the ranges of Cd toxicity thresholds of 10% seedling growth inhibition (EC(10)) and 50% inhibition (EC(50)) followed the order: soil pore water Cd (EC(10) on average 0.88Â mgÂ L(-1) with the variation of 54.9 folds and EC(50) on average 2.28Â mgÂ L(-1) with variation of 41.8 folds), DTPA extractable Cd (EC(10) on average 5.4Â mgÂ kg(-1) with 20.9 folds variation and EC(50) on average 17.86Â mgÂ kg(-1) with 6.6 folds variation), total added Cd (EC(10) on average 6.55Â mgÂ kg(-1) with 16.7 folds variation and EC(50) on average 22.11Â mgÂ kg(-1) with 5.1 folds variation), which suggested that whatever the available Cd expressed, its toxicity is largely affected by soil properties. The empirical multiple equations were well developed between different fractions of Cd toxicity thresholds ECx (xÂ =Â 10 or 50) and soil/solution. The results also showed that the pH inversely correlated with EC(10) (r(2)Â =Â 0.54, PÂ <Â 0.01) and EC(50) (r(2)Â =Â 0.63, PÂ <Â 0.001) based on soil pore water, indicating the ECx decreased with more toxicity as pH increased. No single significant soil solution properties were found for ECx in DTPA extractable Cd. For the ECx of DTPA extractable and total Cd, the content of aluminum oxides in soil and soil pH were the two significant factors inversely related with ECx, which explained 68%-79% of the inter-soil variation, respectively. Overall, soil or solution pH was the most important factor controlling Cd toxicity thresholds. Meanwhile, significant negative correlations existed between the soil solution pH and the slopes of parameter (b) of the dose-response curves for different fractions of Cd, implying that the growth of toxic effect enhanced as unit Cd dosage increased in low pH soils. These results will be helpful to evaluate the metal ecological risk in forest soils.",
2641,"[The importance of water testing for public health in two regions in Rio de Janeiro: a focus on fecal coliforms, nitrates, and aluminum] In developing countries, due to poor sanitation conditions and poor quality of drinking water, typical water-borne diseases and more recently diseases caused by drinking water with high concentrations of nitrates and certain metals like aluminum have increased the concern over the health effects of these compounds. Several articles have shown associations between nitrates and methemoglobinemia in children, and aluminum and Alzheimer disease in adults. This study identified water quality with several parameters in non-conformity with Brazilian drinking water standards (Ruling 36/90): more than 50% of all samples from both regions contained fecal coliforms; some 31% of water samples from wells in Duque de Caxias had excessive nitrate concentrations; 100% of all groundwater samples from both regions showed aluminum concentrations not conforming to the norm, with the same result for 100% of samples from the drinking water distribution system in SÃ£o GonÃ§alo and 75% of same in Duque de Caxias. This lack of conformity poses several health risks for the local population.",
2642,"Predictive approach for simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation of arsenic by Corynebacterium glutamicum MTCC 2745 biofilm supported on NL/MnFe2O4 composite The potential use of Corynebacterium glutamicum MTCC 2745 biofilm supported on NL/MnFe2O4 composite for eliminating both As(III) and As(V) from synthetic wastewater was inspected in a batch assay. Effects of operating parameters like pH, biosorbent dose, contact time, temperature and initial adsorbate concentration onto the removal efficiency was investigated. Minimum contact time to achieve equilibrium is 260 min at pH 7.0 at 30 degrees C temperature for both ions. Existence of functional groups onto the surface of biosorbent attached with biofilm that may interact with the As(III) and As(V) ions was proved by FT-IT, to estimate the applicability of this system for the elimination of those ions. To determine the most suitable correlation for the equilibrium curves employing the method of the nonlinear regression for curve fitting analysis, isotherm studies were carried out for As(III) and As(V) utilizing 30 isotherm models. The pattern of biosorption/bioaccumulation fitted well with Vieth and Sladek isotherm model for As(III) and Brouers-Sotolongo and Fritz-Schlunder-V isotherm models for As(V). D-R isotherm studies indicated that ion-exchange might play a prominent role. Desorption study was also performed with different concentrations of NaOH solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2643,"Holocene vegetation-hydrology-climate interactions of wetlands on the Heixiazi Island, China An integrated view of wetland's evolution is currently poorly understood due to a lack of knowledge on long-term interactions of multiple ecological factors. Here, we present a cored palynological record covering the Holocene Epoch from a depressional wetland on Heixiazi Island (China). With the aid of principal component analysis and duster analysis of the palynological data, the historical vegetation regime has been well reconstructed for wetlands on the island. With further assistance from the published data on local hydrology and regional East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) variations, the interactions of vegetation, hydrology, and climate in the island's wetlands have been thoroughly analyzed with correlation analysis of the three factors. The results indicate that a strong EASM generally led to a high water level in the wetlands from increased monsoonal precipitation, causing an increase in arboreal vegetation and a decrease in herbs. Alternatively, a weak EASM generally led to low water levels due to decreased monsoonal precipitation, causing a decrease in arboreal vegetation and an increase in herbs. The local vegetation regime during the early Holocene was marked by an increase in tree/herb ratio due to rising water levels under the influence of an increasingly strengthened EASM. Subsequently, a general decline of the tree/herb ratio occurred from a gradual decrease in water level during the mid and late Holocene when the EASM gradually retreated. The wettest stage marked by the highest water level and tree/herb ratio occurred 8.0-4.6 ka BP with the strongest EASM. The driest stage occurred during the last 0.4 ka BP, which was attributed to both the weakest EASM influence and anthropogenic disturbance. Our study provides an integrated view of the wetlands ecological dynamics incorporating multi-factor interactions, which further sheds light on the EASM driving mechanisms on wetlands evolution during the Holocene Epoch.

2644,"Drilling deviated wells in a highly unstable gas field in southern part of Iran Offshore fields are usually developed through several deviated wells drilled from each platform to increase the drainage area. However, drilling deviated boreholes mostly have the potential of wellbore mechanical instabilities which may lead to excessive cost and risk. Herein, we investigated the optimum wellbore trajectory and Safe Mud Weight Window (SMWW) for developing an offshore carbonate gas field in southern part of Iran. This was done through building a Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) followed by carrying out sensitivity analyses on various wellbore deviation and azimuth. Results showed drilling deviated wellbores in the minimum horizontal stress direction yields wider SMWW in comparison to the direction of maximum horizontal stress. However, full waveform sonic scanner data showed that the horizontal stresses re-orientate as the depth increases. Therefore, a particular well trajectory does not necessarily lead to an optimal stable deviated wellbore for all layers. Different wellbore trajectories were recommended to reduce wellbore instability problems. For a 2D wellbore trajectory, a kickoff point at a depth of 1000 m was suggested with an azimuth towards NE or SW. This would result in mitigating wellbore mechanical instabilities for future deviated wellbores being drilled in this field.",
2645,"Patterns of Plant Biomass Allocation in Temperate Grasslands across a 2500-km Transect in Northern China Plant biomass allocation between below- and above-ground parts can actively adapt to the ambient growth conditions and is a key parameter for estimating terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) stocks. To investigate how climatic variations affect patterns of plant biomass allocation, we sampled 548 plants belonging to four dominant genera (Stipa spp., Cleistogenes spp., Agropyron spp., and Leymus spp.) along a large-scale (2500 km) climatic gradient across the temperate grasslands from west to east in northern China. Our results showed that Leymus spp. had the lowest root/shoot ratios among the each genus. Root/shoot ratios of each genera were positively correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT), and negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) across the transect. Temperature contributed more to the variation of root/shoot ratios than precipitation for Cleistogenes spp. (C4 plants), whereas precipitation exerted a stronger influence than temperature on their variations for the other three genera (C3 plants). From east to west, investment of C into the belowground parts increased as precipitation decreased while temperature increased. Such changes in biomass allocation patterns in response to climatic factors may alter the competition regimes among co-existing plants, resulting in changes in community composition, structure and ecosystem functions. Our results suggested that future climate change would have great impact on C allocation and storage, as well as C turnover in the grassland ecosystems in northern China.",
2646,"HEAVY METALS, ARSENIC AND BORON IN UNDERGROUND IRRIGATION WATER OF ZACOALCO DE TORRES AND AUTLAN DE NAVARRO, JALISCO The high concentrations of heavy metals in groundwater used for irrigation have the potential of causing physiological damage in agricultural crops, as well as reducing the quality and yield of harvests. Furthermore, there are effects on human health due to the consumption of contaminated products. The objective of the present study was to determine the concentration of Cd, Hg, Pb, As and B in the groundwater for agricultural use in the municipalities of Autlan de Navarro and Zocoalco de Torres, Jalisco, Mexico, both with high agricultural activity. The study was conducted from February to April and from August to November of 2017, and 24 samples of groundwater were analyzed per season. The evaluations were as follows: potential of hydrogen (pH) and electric conductivity (C.E.); quantification of the heavy metals cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and the metalloid arsenic (As); content of boron (B) in the groundwater given its nutrimental and toxic importance. The heavy metals were determined by atomic emission spectrometry and the concentrations found were compared with the guidelines of the NOM-001-ECOL-1996. On the average, electric conductivity was 665 mu S cm(-1) and the pH 7.7, values that do not represent restriction with respect to the use of agricultural irrigation water. In the heavy metals, the Hg exceeded in 100% of the samples the maximum limits established with an average concentration of 0.14 mu g L-1, the metalloid As exceeded in 16% of the samples the maximum limit with an average concentration of 0.13 mg L-1, but Cd, Pb and B did not surpass the values established as permissible limit for the use of water in agricultural irrigation.",
2647,"ANALYSIS OF SELECTED ELEMENTS IN WATER IN THE DRINKING WATER PREPARATION PLANTS IN BELGRADE, SERBIA Belgrade's water supply relies mainly on the River Sava and groundwater supply wells, which are located in the vicinity of the river and Ada Ciganlija. In this paper, the contents of aluminum, boron, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, barium and lead were analyzed in raw water as well as drinking water distributed by the Water Supply and Sewage of Belgrade. A total of 14 samples were examined from all water treatment plants that are part of the distribution system. The measurements were conducted using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique. The aim of this research was to examine the effectiveness of the drinking water preparation process in the plants belonging to the Water Supply and Sewage of Belgrade. The content of certain elements varies considerably in raw water (river and groundwater): the concentration of boron in river water is two to three times lower than the concentration in groundwater; the concentration of arsenic in river water is ten to twenty five times lower than the concentration in groundwater; the concentration of aluminum in all groundwater samples was below the detection limit of the instrument (0.50 mu g/dm(3)), whilst in the river water the content of aluminum was about 50 mu g/dm(3) and the concentration of manganese in the river water was up to 10 times lower than the concentrations in groundwater. In all drinking water samples the concentration of the elements were bellow the maximum allowed levels according to the Serbian regulations. Correlation coefficients determined for boron, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, barium and lead, which were analyzed in raw waters, show that four groups of elements can be distinguished. Boron, manganese, arsenic and barium are related to each other and probably have a common natural origin; copper and lead probably have a common anthropogenic origin; correlation of nickel and cobalt was observed, while zinc was not in correlation with any other element.",
2648,"EVIDENCE OF ROOF COLLAPSE DETECTED ON SOUTH AFRICAN COAL MINES USING SENTINEL-1 INTERFEROMETRY Surface subsidence associated with underground coal mining is a known concern due to the associated environmental as well as health and safety risks. This paper evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1 repeat-pass differential interferometry for monitoring mining-induced deformation. The area under investigation is a coal mining region in South Africa where pillar-extraction is taking place. The pillar extraction causes a weakening of pillars leading to roof collapse and subsequent deformation at the surface. The results of Sentinel-1 dInSAR analysis suggest that several deformation features could be observed during almost 2-years of monitoring and the evolution and progression of deformation basins over time could be studied. The results further indicate that operational monitoring of mining-induced deformation by Sentinel-1 interferometry would be possible assuming data continuity can be ensured. Since many mines are considering pillar-extraction as the end-of-life of the mine is reached, continued Sentinel-1 dInSAR observations can be incorporated into operational monitoring programmes.",
2649,"Geochemical and Multivariate Statistical Evaluation of Trace Elements in Groundwater of Nigde Municipality, South-Central Turkey: Implications for Arsenic Contamination and Human Health Risks Assessment This study was conducted to determine the concentrations of trace elements, their sources, and human health risks associated with arsenic contamination in groundwater of the Nigde Municipality, south-central Turkey. Fourteen groundwater samples were collected from groundwater supply sources fed by the Nigde water distribution system and were analysed for Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, and Ba concentrations. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to decipher the source and interrelationships among trace elements in groundwater. The groundwater is mainly tapped from Quaternary alluvial and volcanic aquifers of the Nigde Massif. The pH of groundwater is slightly acidic to neutral, which controls the solubility and mobility of the trace elements. The mean concentrations of the trace elements vary in the order Zn > Fe > Ba > As > Cr > Ni > Se > Cu > Co > Mn > Al. All of the trace element concentrations comply with the maximum permissible values provided by the Turkish Standards Institution and the World Health Organization, except Zn, Cr, and As. However, approximately 7.14% of the studied samples are contaminated with Zn and Cr, whereas 86% are contaminated with As. The As concentrations range from 9.47 to 32.9 mu g/L with an average value of 16.8 mu g/L. Contamination assessment indicates that the As contamination is dominant in the southern and southwestern parts of the area. The primary source of As in groundwater is attributed to geogenic processes involving weathering and dissolution of bed rocks and other factors, such as pH conditions, adsorption, and surface complexation. Three bimetallic complex associations are distinguished in groundwater: Fe-coordination group, As-coordination group and Ba-coordination group, all showing strong positive correlation with Cu and Ni. The As-coordination group is the most dominant in groundwater, which resulted in the high As content of groundwater. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that As mobilization in groundwater is associated with pH, EC, Ni, Cu, and Ba depending on the redox conditions of the aquifer, controlled mainly by geogenic processes. The carcinogenic risk of arsenic affecting children and adults reaches 2 x 10(-4)and 3 x 10(-4), respectively, exceeding the guideline value of 1 x 10(-4). The estimated hazard quotient for children is in the range of 1.79-6.21, whereas that of adults is 0.77-2.66, indicating that children in the municipality are more exposed to the noncarcinogenic effects of the consumption of high groundwater arsenic.",
2650,"Parasitic Infections Parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract are a cause of morbidity to millions of individuals worldwide. These parasites are endemic in underdeveloped countries with poor sanitation allowing for spread through contaminated water supplies. While much is known about these parasites, the cutaneous manifestations caused by infection are infrequently reported in the literature. The deposition of the parasites into the perianal region often leads to significant skin irritation. Cutaneous findings vary from a mild pruritus ani to a macular rash to even severe perianal ulceration. This article discusses the perianal cutaneous findings caused by the parasitic illnesses, amebiasis, schistosomiasis, Enterobius vermicularis, strongyloidiasis, and cutaneous larva migrans, as well as their respective management.",
2651,"[Diel variations of hydrochemistry and influencing factors in a surface stream in subtropical karst area, SW China] In order to understand the diel variation and influencing factors of hydrochemistry in a surface creek fed by karst subterranean river in a subtropical area, where is located at Guancun Village, Daliang Township, Rong'an County of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, two monitoring sites were set simultaneously to launch Guancun subterranean river outlet (G1) and surface creek mouth (G2), respectively. Physical and hydrochemical parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature (T) and specific conductivity (Spc) were measured at 15-minute intervals and water samples for analyzing major ions such as Ca2+, HCO3- and NO3- as well as delta3C(DIC) were collected at 2-hour intervals. The results showed that: (1) G1 and G2 sites were both HCO3- Ca type water, however the two monitoring sites showed different diel variations of hydrogeochemical process; (2) The physical and hydrochemical parameters (T, DO, pH, Spc) and major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, SO4(2-), NO3-, Cl- in G1 site were basically stable, while the physical and hydrochemical parameters (T, DO, pH, Spc) and major ions (Ca2+, HCO3- and NO3-) in G2 site displayed regular diel variation during monitoring; (3) The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and delta13C values in G2 monitoring site showed reverse characteristics in diurnal fluctuations, where DIC decreased in daylight and increased at night while the delta13C value increased in daylight and decreased at night, DIC also showed a negative correlation with the delta13C value (correlation coefficient is -0. 87, P < 0.01) in G2 site. These results indicated that photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic plants, water temperature and degassing jointly affected diurnal variation of hydrochemistry and controlled the cycling process of internal matter in this surface creek fed by karst subterranean river.",
2652,"Organochlorine contaminants in cormorant, darter, egret, and ibis eggs from South Africa During the last 15 years, no research has been published on the levels of pesticides in bird eggs from South Africa, despite the high levels found previously. We analysed eggs from African darter, cattle egret, reed cormorant, African sacred ibis, as well as single eggs from sonic other species, and found HCB, DDTs, HCHs, chlordanes and PCBs Lit detectable levels. The presence of mirex in all species was unexpected, since this compound was never registered in South Africa. It also seemed as if terrestrial feeding birds had higher DDE:PCB ratios when compared with aquatic feeding birds. Except for chlordane, the African darter eggs had the highest levels of all other compounds (mean 370 and 300 ng g(-1) ww Sigma pesticides and Sigma PCBs, respectively). Multivariate analysis clearly distinguished the aquatic and terrestrially feeding birds on pollution profile. The African darter (aquatic feeding) and the cattle egret (terrestrial feeding) would be good indicator candidates. Eggshell thinning was detected in the African darter, and was associated with most of the compounds, including DDE and PCBs. We raise a concern that generally longer living birds in warmer climates, laying fewer eggs per clutch, might be at increased risk when compared with trophically similar birds exposed to equivalent levels of pollution in colder climates. Given the scarcity of water and the high biodiversity in Southern Africa, climate change will exert strong pressure, and any additional anthropogenic contamination Lit levels that can cause subtle behavioural, developmental and reproductive changes, can have serious effects.

2653,"NEUROLOGICAL IMPACTS OF EXPOSURE TO HIGH AND LOW ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATIONS OF ARSENIC IN DRINKING WATER AND SOILS Environmental arsenic (As) contamination has been reported in many countries, including Chile, Taiwan, India, Thailand, and Hungary. Ingestion of contaminated ground water, which is the primary source of drinking water for many people, is the most studied route of environmental As exposure. This has been well-documented in Bangladesh, where 30-40 million people have been chronically exposed to high As concentrations in drinking water, and many negative neurological effects have been documented. Negative neurological effects have also been observed in individuals exposed to high As concentrations in soil and dust due to anthropogenic activities (e.g. mining, pesticide application, etc.). In contrast, there is limited published information available directly connecting any specific health outcomes to low As concentrations in either water or soil, in part because methods for examining these relationships have not been well-established. However, the development of novel statistical techniques for analyzing potential associations of low As concentrations in soil with specific negative neurological health outcomes in children may offer a new approach, as is being investigated as part of an on-going study in South Carolina, USA. In this chapter, we will examine the current literature on neurological health effects associated with exposure to high and low environmental As concentrations in both water and soil, with a particular focus on children and the developing fetus, populations which are generally at higher risk to environmental toxicants due to ongoing rapid developmental changes.",
2654,"Food of larval Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles varuna in a stream habitat in Sri Lanka No previous studies have been conducted on the natural food of larval Anopheles culicifacies s.l. (the major malaria vector) and An. varuna (a secondary vector) in Sri Lanka. The present study analyzed the contents of guts dissected from larvae collected from pools in a natural stream-cum-irrigation conveyance channel in the Upper Yan Oya watershed in the North Central Province of the country during August-September 1997 and July 1998. Determinations of physicochemical and biological parameters of the pools and their water were done at the same time. A fluorochromatic stain, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, was used to stain larval gut contents. Quantitative estimates of different categories of food types were made by analyzing the gut contents of 95 An. culicifacies (26 second instars and 69 fourth instars) and 52 An. varuna (21 second instars and 31 fourth instars). Detritus was the most frequent food type, comprising >74% of the gut contents in both species. Other food types included bacteria (cocci and rods), filamentous algae, diatoms, and desmids. Overall, bacteria constituted a significantly higher proportion of the gut contents in An. culicifacies than in An varuna. Significantly more detritus, bacteria, and total particulate matter occurred in 4th instars of An. culicifacies than in An. varuna, indicating a greater food intake in the former species. Second instars of An. culicifacies and An. varuna did not differ significantly in any parameter. A significant increase in food intake between 2nd and 4th instars was seen for An. culicifacies, but not An. varuna. Food indices were lower in An. varuna than in An. culicifacies when the 2 species co-occurred, indicating competition for food, and the implications of this to adult body size, survival, and fecundity are discussed.",
2655,"Determination of surface properties of iron hydroxide-coated alumina adsorbent prepared for removal of arsenic from drinking water A novel type adsorbent was prepared by in situ precipitation of Fe(OH)3 on the surface of activated Al2O3 as a support material. The iron content of the adsorbent was 0.31 +/- 0.003% m/m (56.1 mmol/g); its mechanical and chemical stability proved to be appropriate in solutions. The total capacity of the adsorbent was 0.12 mmol/g, and the pH of zero point of charge, pH(zpc) = 6.9 +/- 0.3. Depending on the pH of solutions, the adsorbent can be used for binding of both anions and cations, if pH(eq) < pH(zpc) anions are sorbed on the surface of adsorbent (S) through {S-OH2+} and {S-OH} groups. A graphical method was used for the determination of pH(iep) (isoelectric points) of the adsorbent and values of pH(iep) = 6.1 +/- 0.3 for As(III) and pH(iep) = 8.0 +/- 0.3 for As(V) ions were found. The amount of surface charged groups (Q) was about zero within the a pH range of 6.5-8.6, due to the practically neutral surface formed on the adsorption of As(V) ions. At acidic pH (pH 4.7), Q = 0.19 mol/kg was obtained. The adsorption of arsenate and arsenite ions from solutions of 0.1-0.4 mmol/L was represented by Langmuir-type isotherms. A great advantage of the adsorbent is that it can be used in adsorption columns, and low waste technology for removal of arsenic from drinking water can be developed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

2656,"Crack growth rate evaluation of alloys 690/152 by numerical simulation of extracted CT specimens While nickel-based alloys have been widely used for power plants due to corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties, during the last couple of decades, failures of nuclear components increased gradually. One of main degradation mechanisms was primary water stress corrosion cracking at dissimilar metal welds of piping and reactor head penetrations. In this context, precise estimation of welding effects became an important issue for ensuring reliability of them. The present study deals with a series of finite element analyses and crack growth rate evaluation of Alloys 690/152. Firstly, variation of residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains was simulated taking into account welding of a cylindrical block. Subsequently, extraction and pre-cracking of compact tension (CT) specimens were considered from different locations of the block. Finally, crack growth curves of the alloys and heat affected zone were developed based on analyses results combined with experimental data in references. Characteristics of crack growth behaviors were also discussed in relation to mechanical and fracture parameters. (C) 2019 Korean Nuclear Society, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.",
2657,"[Detection of carcinogen in source drinking water in stomach cancer prevalent areas of Zanhuang county] Benzo(a) pyrene, aflatoxin, sterigmatocystin and six kinds of nitrosamine and their precursors (secondary amine) in 36 specimens of source drinking water collected from stomach cancer prevalent areas of Zanhuang County during the autumn and spring periods were determined quantitatively with high performance liquid chromatography. Results showed drinking water for local residents was significantly contaminated with benzo(a) pyrene, with an average of 0.0148 microgram/L and the highest one of 0.0305 microgram/L, and especially in the autumn, simultaneous contamination with nitrosodimethylamine, nitrosodiethylamine, and nitrosodipropylamine could be found, with proportions of 38.5%, 76.9% and 76.9%, respectively. Aflatoxin B1, and G1 could also be found in drinking water in the autumn, but no sterigmatocystin could be detected.",
2658,"Human health risk via soil ingestion of potentially toxic elements and remediation potential of native plants near an abandoned mine spoil in Ghana Integrated studies about potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in sites near gold mining spoils, their contamination and human health risk, as well as remediation potential of native plants are limited. Therefore, our aim was to assess the human health risk of PTEs (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Ti, V, and Zn) in sites near an abandoned gold mine spoil in Ghana. We collected 52 soil samples near the mine spoil and from a natural forest, determined their total element contents, and calculated the soil contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (I(geo)) and the pollution load index (PLI). In addition, we calculated the human health risk of soil ingestion for adult males, females, and children using the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI). We also assessed the phytoremediation potential of five native plants (Alchornea cordifolia, Chromolaena odorata, Lantana camara, Pityrogramma calomelanos- fern, and Pueraria montana) growing near the mine spoil, and calculated their transfer coefficient (TC) and translocation factor (TF). Total content of As (maximum: 3144.0 mg/kg) surpassed the trigger action value of 65 mg/kg. Total Zn content at 90th percentile in the Pueraria field (197 mg/kg) and maximum value at mine surrounding (76.7 mg/kg) were above the world soil average (70 mg/kg). Pollution load index and EF values indicated severe levels of soil contamination particularly with As and Ti. Hazard index (HI) values for all sites for children (0.7-134.56), adult males (0.05-10.6), and adult females (0.13-12.77) were above 1 and indicated high human health risk especially on children and women. Translocation factor shows that native plant species such as Chromolaena odorata and fern accumulated As, Cu, Ti, and Zn into their shoots and may thus have the potential to reduce the high soil contamination and its associated human health risk.",
2659,"Environmental enterococci: I. Prevalence of virulence, antibiotic resistance and species distribution in poultry and its related environment in Karachi, Pakistan Enterococci are well-established causative agents of a number of diseases in humans and animals alike. A total of 1047 isolates (838 presumptive enterococci and 209 non-enterococci), related to poultry environment (faeces/manure, feed, water and air), were evaluated for species diversity, virulence potential, antibiotic resistance and associated threats. Multiplex PCR of 204 presumptive enterococci using genus (16s rDNA)- and species-specific (superoxide dismutase) primer set leads to identification of six Enterococcus spp., i.e. Ent.faecium, Ent.faecalis, Ent.mundtti, Ent.hirae, Ent.gallinarum and Ent.casseliflavus. BOX-PCR analysis of the representative strains confirmed inter-strain variation among species. Although enterococci generally appear to be catalase negative, Ent.faecalis from some faecal, water and air samples showed catalase production. In vitro assays identified poultry environment as a reservoir of MVD and MAR enterococci and non-enterococci. In addition to vancomycin, high-level-ampicillin-, clarithromycin-, erythromycin-, kanamycin- and gentamicin-resistant enterococci and non-enterococci are also indicated. Our results show that virulence potential and resistance vary with the source of isolation. Our studies on MAR and MVD enterococci in environment, especially in air and water, clearly indicate the need for a serious commitment to deal with pathogenic enterococci associated with poultry for preventing transmission of infectious agent to humans. Significance and Impact of the Study This study demonstrates that poultry environment of Karachi city harbours a diverse reservoir of Enterococcus spp. with multiple antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants. It is expected that the results will help in assessing the impact of multiple antibiotic resistance and virulent enterococci on public health, improvement of farm management practices and preventing their dissemination. Our findings strongly suggest the need for reducing antibiotic usage during poultry production, particularly those that are being used to treat human infections.",
2660,"Sutherlandia frutescens may exacerbate HIV-associated neuroinflammation BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is central to the aetiology of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) that are prevalent in late stage AIDS. Anti-retroviral (ARV) treatments are rolled out relatively late in the context of neuroinflammatory changes, so that their usefulness in directly preventing HAND is probably limited. It is common practice for HIV+ individuals in developing countries to make use of traditional medicines. One such medicine is Sutherlandia frutescens - commonly consumed as a water infusion. Here its efficacy as an anti-inflammatory modality in this context was investigated in an in vitro co-culture model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: Single cultures of human astrocytes (HA), HUVECs and primary human monocytes, as well as co-cultures (BBB), were stimulated with HIV-1 subtype B & C Tat protein and/or HL2/3 cell secretory proteins after pre-treatment with S.frutescens extract. Effects of this pre-treatment on pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and monocyte migration across the BBB were assessed. RESULTS: In accordance with others, B Tat was more pro-inflammatory than C Tat, validating our model. S.frutescens decreased IL-1Î² secretion significantly (P < 0.0001), but exacerbated both monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P < 0001) - a major role player in HIV-associated neuroinflammation - and CD14+ monocyte infiltration across the BBB (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Current data illustrates that the combined use of HL2/3 cells and the simulated BBB presents an accurate, physiologically relevant in vitro model with which to study neuroinflammation in the context of HIV/AIDS. In addition, our results caution against the use of S.frutescens as anti-inflammatory modality at any stage post-HIV infection.",
2661,"Development and evaluation of a real-time forecasting framework for daily water quality forecasts for Lake Chaohu to Lead time of six days The socioeconomic benefits associated with informative water quality forecasts for large lakes are becoming increasingly evident. However, it remains an enormous challenge to produce forecasts of water quality variables that are accurate enough to meet public demand. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new forecast framework for real-time forecasting of daily dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations at lead times from one to six days for Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China. The forecast framework is based on a 3-D hydrodynamic ecological model referred to as EcoLake. We used hydrological, meteorological and water quality data from multiple sources to generate initial conditions and forcing functions. Solar radiation and inflows from tributaries which are not readily available were calculated using forecasted cloud cover and rainfall. Forecast skill was evaluated based on 122 forecasts produced on different days in 2017 and for each of the 12 sampling sites. Results indicate that the skill of the forecast framework varies considerably across water quality variables, sampling sites, and lead times. Generally, the forecast framework is more skillful than the persistence forecasts, which use the most recent observations as forecasts. The TN forecasts tend to be the most skillful with a mean RMSE skill score of 28.5% averaged across the six lead times. The DO forecasts tend to have the lowest skill with an average value of 10.9%. Model sensitivity experiments further revealed that errors in the raw air temperature and wind speed forecasts have a noticeable impact on the overall skill of DO and NH forecasts. The forecast framework proposed here could be a useful operational forecasting tool to enhance the effectiveness of the drinking water supply and public health protection based on the water quality management of Lake Chaohu.",
2662,"Application of magnetic peanut husk for methylene blue adsorption in batch mode Magnetic peanut husk (PN-Fe3O4) was prepared by co-precipitation and applied for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from the solution. The results from the characterization of PN-Fe3O4 showed that Fe3O4 was successfully loaded onto peanut husk. The effect of factors such as pH, temperature, salt, and contact time on the adsorption process were carried out using the batch method. The adsorption isotherm was well-described by the Langmuir isotherm whereas the pseudo-second kinetic-order was observed to be the best fitted kinetic model. The maximum equilibrium capacity of PN-Fe3O4 according to the Langmuir model was 32.5 mg g(-1) at 303 K. After three adsorption cycles, PN-Fe3O4 had significant adsorption capacities as well as its magnetic properties which ensures its easy separation from the aqueous solution by the use of a magnet. A single-stage batch design for MB adsorption was also presented based on the Langmuir isotherm model. PN-Fe3O4 is promising as an adsorbent to remove dyes from the solution.",
2663,"Seasonal variations of nitrogen and phosphorus retention in an agricultural drainage river in East China BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Riverine retention decreases loads of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in running water. It is an important process in nutrient cycling in watersheds. However, temporal riverine nutrient retention capacity varies due to changes in hydrological, ecological, and nutrient inputs into the watershed. Quantitative information of seasonal riverine N and P retention is critical for developing strategies to combat diffuse source pollution and eutrophication in riverine and coastal systems. This study examined seasonal variation of riverine total N (TN) and total P (TP) retention in the ChangLe River, an agricultural drainage river in east China. METHODS: Water quality, hydrological parameters, and hydrophyte coverage were monitored along the ChangLe River monthly during 2004-2006. Nutrient export loads (including chemical fertilizer, livestock, and domestic sources) entering the river from the catchment area were computed using an export coefficient model based on estimated nutrient sources. Riverine TN and TP retention loads (RNRL and RPRL) were estimated using mass balance calculations. Temporal variations in riverine nutrient retention were analyzed statistically. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Estimated annual riverine retention loads ranged from 1,538 to 2,127 t year(-1) for RNRL and from 79.4 to 90.4 t year(-1) for RPRL. Monthly retention loads varied from 6.4 to 300.8 t month(-1) for RNRL and from 1.4 to 15.3 t month(-1) for RPRL. Both RNRL and RPRL increased with river flow, water temperature, hydrophyte coverage, monthly sunshine hours, and total TN and TP inputs. Dissolved oxygen concentration and the pH level of the river water decreased with RNRL and RPRL. Riverine nutrient retention ratios (retention as a percentage of total input) were only related to hydrophyte coverage and monthly sunshine hours. Monthly variations in RNRL and RPRL were functions of TN and TP loads. CONCLUSIONS: Riverine nutrient retention capacity varied with environmental conditions. Annual RNRL and RPRL accounted for 30.3-48.3% and 52.5-71.2%, respectively, of total input TN and TP loads in the ChangLe River. Monthly riverine retention ratios were 3.5-88.7% for TN and 20.5-92.6% for TP. Hydrophyte growth and coverage on the river bed is the main cause for seasonal variation in riverine nutrient retention capacity. The total input TN and TP loads were the best indicators of RNRL and RPRL, respectively. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: High riverine nutrient retention capacity during summer due to hydrophytic growth is favorable to the avoidance of algal bloom in both river systems and coastal water in southeast China. Policies should be developed to strictly control nutrient applications on agricultural lands. Strategies for promoting hydrophyte growth in rivers are desirable for water quality management.",
2664,"Water Quality Changes during the Initial Operating Phase of Riverbank Filtration Sites in Upper Egypt To meet the increasing water demand and to provide safe drinking water in Egypt, the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater (HCWW) and its affiliated companies have started a program to develop riverbank filtration (RBF) sites in all Egyptian governorates. The paper gives an overview of water quality changes as a result of RBF, during the initial phase of operation at three sites in Upper Egypt, between 2015 and 2018. Significant changes were observed for chloride, sulfate, iron, manganese, ammonium, and in the bacterial counts. After the initiation of pumping from the RBF wells, it took 2 to 8 months until stable water quality was observed for the hydrochemical parameters and 2 to 14 months for the microbiological parameters. The results showed that RBF wells should be operated continuously, to maintain the advantage of lower Fe and Mn concentrations achieved by the wash-out effect in the aquifer zone, between the river bank and the RBF wells.",
2665,"Bioremediation of Cadmium by Mixed Indigenous Isolates Serratia liquefaciens BSWC3 and Klebsiella Pneumoniae RpSWC3 Isolated from Industrial and Mining Affected Water Samples A total of 58 Cadmium tolerant bacterial isolates were isolated from 26 samples collected from 20 villages/city of different contaminated water samples from industrial and mining affected areas of Chhattisgarh (India). Out of 58 bacterial isolates, 15 bacterial isolates were able to grow in presence of 40 mM cadmium chloride. These fifteen were further screened by biochemical characterization, antibiotic susceptibility and presence of czcA gene. However, finally five selected isolates (BSWC3, RgCWC2, RgUWC1, RpSWC3, KDWC1) were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing belonged to the genus Serratia liquefaciens, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pantoea dispersa and Enterobacter tabaci, respectively. Among these two best culture Serratia liquefaciens BSWC3 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RpSWC3 were testes for their bioremediation efficiency individually as well as in mixed culture. Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer analysis of samples revealed that cadmium (Cd) tolerant bacterial isolates BSWC3, RpSWC3 and Combination of BSWC3 and RpSWC3 were significantly reduce of cadmium concentration i.e. 44.46%, 40% and 50.92%, respectively as compared to control. Therefore, the finding of the present study revealed the use of mixed culture or consortium of indigenous isolates is the better option for bioremediation of heavy metals.",
2666,"Resistivity and acoustic image analysis of the main borehole (CCSD-MH), eastern China Resistivity and acoustic imaging is one of the most successful tool used in the Main Hole of Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD-MH) Project, which is located in Maobei Village, Donghai County, Jiansu Province, eastern China. The upper 900 m is subjected to more than one tectonic phase, caused by compression stresses of SE-NW, and NE-SW directions. This upper part is characterized by fractures which are vertical and highly dipping, mainly 40 degrees-70 degrees, expected to be mylonites of fault zones, in addition to conductive shear zones. Those zones play an important role in weathering of rocks mainly during the intersection of E, SE and S dipping fractures. Mineral alteration in mafic rocks is so distinctive especially at the boundaries with other rocks. Paragneiss shows clear foliation and regularly-spaced jointings. The orientation of the present days stress is NE-SW, deduced from drilling-induced fractures. The maximum principal horizontal stress direction is NE-SW known from breakouts in the lower depths. The rocks at lower depths are dense, slightly weathered and with closed fracturing.",
2667,"Distribution of Aluminum Fractionation in the Acidic Rhizosphere Soils of Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb) The modified Tessier's sequential extraction procedure and rhizobox cultivation were employed to investigate the distribution of aluminum (Al) fractions in the acidic rhizosphere soil of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana lamb) seedlings. The results showed that the Al in soils was fractionated into five operationally defined fractions. Three sets of soil samples used in the rhizoboxes were collected from the three forest sites in the southeast of China: Sichuan, Zhejian, and Jiangsu. At the end of 100-day cultivation, the rhizosphere Al fractions for the original or bulk soils were in the order of residual > iron-manganese (Fe-Mn) oxides > organic > carbonate > exchangeable. However, in rhizosphere soil, the Al fraction follows the order of residual > organic > Fe-Mn oxides > carbonate > exchangeable. On average, the rhizosphere experienced significant increase in organically bound Al and slight decrease in exchangeable Al contents, but had decreases in contents for the other three Al fractions compared to the nonrhizosphere. The correlation analysis indicated that the Al contents accumulated in roots were significantly and positively correlated with exchangeable Al contents in the rhizosphere, and also characterized by the major portion of organically bound Al, which exhibited a bioavailable transformation of Al fractions. Results indicated that decreases in both redox potential and soil pH, as well as increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were observed in the rhizosphere. Exchangeable Al and organic Al fractions were dependent mainly on soil pH (hydrogen ion concentration) and DOC, accordingly. Decreasing rhizosphere pH from 5.93 to 3.42 accelerated the secretion of organic carbon. These data are helpful for understanding the mobility and bioavailability of Al fractions in the acidic rhizosphere soils of Masson pine.",
2668,"Chronic prenatal ethanol exposure alters glucocorticoid signalling in the hippocampus of the postnatal guinea pig The present study tested the hypothesis that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure causes long-lasting changes in glucocorticoid signalling in postnatal offspring. Pregnant guinea pigs were treated with ethanol (4 g/kg maternal body weight/day), isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding or water throughout gestation, and maternal saliva cortisol concentration was determined 2 h after treatment at different stages of gestation. Electrically-stimulated release of glutamate and GABA, in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, as well as glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression, was determined in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of adult offspring of treated pregnant guinea pigs. Maternal saliva cortisol concentration increased throughout pregnancy, which was associated with increased foetal plasma and amniotic fluid cortisol concentration. Ethanol administration to pregnant guinea pigs increased maternal saliva cortisol concentration during early and mid-gestation. In late gestation, ethanol administration did not increase saliva cortisol concentration above that induced by pregnancy. Chronic prenatal ethanol exposure had no effect on stimulated glutamate or GABA release, but selectively prevented dexamethasone-mediated suppression of stimulated glutamate release, and decreased expression of mineralocorticoid, but not glucocorticoid, receptor mRNA in the hippocampus of adult offspring. These data indicate that maternal ethanol administration leads to excessively increased maternal cortisol concentration that can impact negatively the developing foetal brain, leading to persistent postnatal deficits in glucocorticoid regulation of glutamate signalling in the adult hippocampus.",
2669,"Effects of chronic lithium on ototoxicity induced by gentamicin and amikacin in guinea-pigs The effects of chronic lithium co-therapy on the expression of gentamicin and amikacin ototoxicity were tested in guinea-pigs. Intramuscular injection of different doses of gentamicin (5, 10 mg/kg/day) and amikacin (150, 300 mg/kg/day) for three weeks, induced hearing loss consistent with the established pattern of aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Lithium salts remains one of the most widely used treatment for depressive illness. Administration of lithium chloride (600 mg/l, 35 days) in drinking water changed auditory brainstem response in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment of animals with lithium chloride after seven days induced significant alterations in wave latency and interval. The present study assesses the protective effects of chronic lithium on gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in guinea pig. The results suggest that duration of lithium administration may be involved in auditory brainstem response changes and the observations could be accounted for, at least partially, by lithium- and aminoglycosides-induced perturbations of the phosphoinositide cascade within the inner ear.",
2670,"Physicochemical and Microbiological Analysis of Drinking Water Treated by Using Ozone This study focused on the application of a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) unit to produce highly oxidizing ozone molecules for the treatment of drinking water. The samples of water were collected from three different sources, namely tap, stone spout and tube-well in the Kathmandu valley. Various physical, chemical and micro-biological analyses were carried out to both the ozone treated and untreated samples of water for comparison. Our results indicated that ozone does not alter the physical characteristics, namely pH, conductivity and turbidity of water but it has significant effect on the chemical properties such as nitrate concentration, total hardness, calcium hardness, Fe(II) and Fe(III) concentration. It was observed that ozone efficiently precipitates ferrous ion into ferric ion and is effective in the removal offecal coliform, a key element for various water related health problems in most of the developing countries. It is shown that the treatment with ozone leads to a significant reduction in the number of fecal coliform in the samples of drinking water from tap, stone spout and tube well with p values 0.00182,0.026 and 5.8 x 10(-15), respectively at 0.05 level of significance.",
2671,"Emerging investigator series: As(v) in magnetite: incorporation and redistribution Exposure to As in groundwater negatively impacts millions of people around the globe, and As mobility in groundwater is often controlled by Fe mineral dissolution and precipitation. Additionally, trace elements can be released from and incorporated into the structure of Fe oxides in the presence of dissolved Fe(II). The potential for As to redistribute between sorbed on the magnetite surface and incorporated in the magnetite structure, however, remains unclear. In this study, we use selective chemical extraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to distinguish magnetite-sorbed and incorporated As(v) and to provide evidence for As(v) incorporation during magnetite precipitation. While As in the As-magnetite coprecipitates did not redistribute between sorbed and incorporated over a 4 month period, a small, but measurable increase in incorporated As(v) of up to 13% was observed for sorbed As(v). We suggest that Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization of magnetite did not significantly influence the redistribution of sorbed As(v) because the extent of Fe atom exchange was small (similar to 10%). In addition, the extent of As redistribution was the same in the absence and presence of added aqueous Fe(II), suggesting that aqueous Fe(II) had, overall, a minor effect on As redistribution for both coprecipitated and sorbed As(v). Our results suggest that coprecipitation of As(v) with magnetite and redistribution of As(v) sorbed on magnetite are potential pathways for irreversible As(v) uptake and sequestration. These pathways are likely to play a significant role in controlling As mobility in natural systems, during human-induced redox cycling of groundwater such as aquifer storage and recovery, as well as in iron oxide-based As removal systems.",
2672,"Seasonal variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in a wetland system of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, southwest China: a quantitative assessment of groundwater inflow fluxes The Caohai Wetland serves as an important ecosystem on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and as a nationally important nature reserve for migratory birds in China. In this study, surface water, groundwater and wetland water were collected for the measurement of environmental isotopes to reveal the seasonal variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes (delta O-18, delta D), sources of water, and groundwater inflow fluxes. Results showed that surface water and groundwater are of meteoric origin. The isotopes in samples of wetland water were well mixed vertically in seasons of both high-flow (September) and low-flow (April); however, marked seasonal and spatial variations were observed. During the high-flow season, the isotopic composition in surface wetland water varied from -97.13 to -41.73aEuro degrees for delta D and from -13.17 to -4.70aEuro degrees for delta O-18. The composition of stable isotopes in the eastern region of this wetland was lower than in the western region. These may have been influenced by uneven evaporation caused by the distribution of aquatic vegetation. During the low-flow season, delta D and delta O-18 in the more open water with dead aquatic vegetation ranged from -37.11 to -11.77aEuro degrees, and from -4.25 to -0.08aEuro degrees, respectively. This may result from high evaporation rates in this season with the lowest atmospheric humidity. Groundwater fluxes were calculated by mass transfer and isotope mass balance approaches, suggesting that the water sources of the Caohai Wetland were mainly from groundwater in the high-flow season, while the groundwater has a smaller contribution to wetland water during the low-flow season.",
2673,"Water conservation through implementation of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis system with recourse to recycling of effluent in textile industry - A case study In compliance with the protection of the drinking water source in one of the state capital of India, a cluster of small scale textile industries implemented membrane processes based on treatability studies for recovery of boiler feed water quality with recourse to effluent recycling/reuse. The paper addresses to a case study in one of the textile units on upgradation of a full scale effluent treatment plant comprising chemical, biological, tertiary and advanced treatment processes. Based on the adequacy assessment of chemical and biological processes, improvement in the performance of the unit processes were achieved through optimization of coagulant dosage for chemical coagulation and build-up of active biomass in the activated sludge system. In addition, application of membrane separation processes comprising ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis units are also highlighted including disposal of reverse osmosis (RO) rejects through evaporator leading to zero liquid effluent discharge. The treatment scheme implemented resulted in conservation of around 55% of fresh water demand for industry. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
2674,"Epidemiology of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults of Salvadoran Agricultural Communities INTRODUCTION In El Salvador, chronic kidney disease is a serious and growing public health problem. Chronic renal failure was the first cause of hospital deaths in men and the fifth in women in 2011. OBJECTIVE Determine prevalence of CKD, CKD risk factors (traditional and nontraditional) and renal damage markers in the adult population of specific rural areas in El Salvador; measure population distribution of renal function; and identify associated risk factors in CKD patients detected. METHODS A cross-sectional analytical epidemiological study was conducted based on active screening for chronic kidney disease and risk factors in persons aged years during 2009-2011. Epidemiological and clinical data were gathered through personal history, as well as urinalysis for renal and vascular damage markers, determinations of serum creatinine and glucose, and estimation of glomerular filtration rates. Chronic kidney disease cases were confirmed at three months. Multiple logistical regression was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 18% (23.9% for men and 13.9% for women) in 2388 persons: 976 men and 1412 women from 1306 families studied. Chronic kidney disease with neither diabetes nor hypertension nor proteinuria >= 1 g/L (51.9%) predominated. Prevalence of chronic renal failure was 11% (17.1% in men and 6.8% in women). Prevalence of renal damage markers was 12.5% (higher in men): microalbuminuria, 6.9%; proteinuria (0.3 g/L), 1.7%; proteinuria (1g/L), 0.6%; proteinuria (2 g/L), 0.4 %; and hematuria, 1.5%. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease risk factors was: diabetes mellitus, 9%; hypertension, 20.9%; family history of chronic kidney disease, 16.5%; family history of diabetes mellitus, 18.5%; family history of hypertension, 30.6%; obesity, 21%; central obesity, 24.9%; NSAID use, 84.2%; smoking, 9.9%; alcohol use, 15%; agricultural occupation, 31.2%; and contact with agrochemicals, 46.7%. Chronic kidney disease was significantly associated with male sex, older age, hypertension, agricultural occupation, family history of chronic kidney disease and contact with the agrochemical methyl parathion. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study support suggestions from other research that we are facing a new form of kidney disease that could be called agricultural nephropathy.",
2675,"The politics of Land Use Planning: Gold mining in Cajamarca, Peru Ecological and Economic Zoning (EEZ) is a Land Use Planning (LUP) methodology that aims at defining separate areas for productive uses and conservation. EEZ is designed as a method that balances different interests and it devises land use policy through stakeholder participation, technical expertise and GIS modelling. The article presents the case study of EEZ in Cajamarca, Peru to analyse the LUP process in a situation of conflicting interests over future land and water use. Cajamarca is a department with rich gold deposits in the headwater catchment area upstream of the city of Cajamarca. During the last decade, rural communities and urban populations have continuously protested against the opening of new open pit mines, as they fear this will affect their water supply. Therefore, the EEZ process became part of a controversy between a powerful pro-mining coalition led by the central government and a conservation coalition led by the regional government. We conclude that in these circumstances, LUP cannot, technically or politically, accommodate the different values attributed to the headwater catchment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2676,"Hospital-based surveillance of enteric parasites in Kolkata BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea is the second leading cause of illness and death in developing countries and the second commonest cause of death due to infectious diseases among children under five in such countries. Parasites, as well as bacterial and viral pathogens, are important causes of diarrhoea. However, parasitic infections are sometimes overlooked, leading after a period of time to an uncertain aetiology. In this paper we report the prevalence of Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium sp. in and around Kolkata. FINDINGS: A hospital-based laboratory surveillance study was conducted among the patients admitted between November 2007 and October 2008 to the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital (Population = 1103) with diarrhoeal complaints. Of the 1103 samples collected, 147 were positive for Giardia lamblia, 84 for Cryptosporidium sp. and 51 for Entamoeba histolytica. For all these parasites there was a high rate of mixed infection with common enteric viruses and bacteria such as Rotavirus, Vibrio cholerae and Shigella sp. There were also cases of co-infection with all other diarrheogenic pathogens. The age group >or= 5 years had the highest prevalence of parasites whereas the age group >5 - 10 years was predominantly infected with Giardia lamblia (p =< 0.001; Odds ratio (OR) = 3.937; 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 1.862 - 8.326) and with all parasites (p = 0.040; OR = 2.043; 95% CI = 1.033 - 4.039). The age group >10 - 20 years could also be considered at risk for G. lamblia (p = 0.009; OR = 2.231; 95% CI = 1.223 - 4.067). Month-wise occurrence data showed an endemic presence of G. lamblia whereas Cryptosporidium sp. and E. histolytica occurred sporadically. The GIS study revealed that parasites were more prevalent in areas such as Tangra, Tiljala and Rajarhat, which are mainly slum areas. Because most of the population surveyed was in the lower income group, consumption of contaminated water and food could be the major underlying cause of parasitic infestations. CONCLUSION: This study provides important information on the occurrence and distribution of three important intestinal parasites and indicates their diarrheogenic capacity in Kolkata and surrounding areas.",
2677,"Enhanced ultrafiltration membrane fouling alleviation by module rotation with Fe-based flocs The modules of ultrafiltration (UF) membrane always occupy a fixed position during filtration. This results in a gradual aggravation of membrane fouling because of the continuous pollutants deposition. However, it is known that the cake layer is composed of loosely hydrolyzed flocs. Therefore, in this study, the rotation concept of membrane-module was investigated in conjunction with the integrated floc (Fe-based)-UF process. We found that the Fe-based flocs can be easily peeled off the membrane surface during rotation, and the UF membrane fouling was alleviated, particularly with spiral module rotation because of the strong shearing force induced. The fouling behavior after spiral module rotation was similar for different floc dosages because of the looseness cake layer formed. The applied computational fluid dynamics model showed that a greater spiral rotation height corresponded to a larger water velocity distribution and stronger shearing force in the membrane tank, and this resulted in a reduction in the fouling degree due to the thinner cake layer formed. Moreover, in comparison with alkaline conditions, a slightly more severe fouling degree was observed under acidic conditions because of the induced denser cake layer with smaller Fe-based floc sizes; however, a significantly higher humic-acid removal efficiency was observed. In addition, UF membrane performed well with river water samples taken from the South-to-North water diversion project in China (Beijing), thereby indicating the rotating module potential application in membrane-based drinking water treatment.",
2678,"The genus Leptonema (Trichoptera : Hydropsychidae) in Costa Rica and description of a new species The genus Leptonema Guerin 1843 (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae: Macronematinae) is one of the best known and most easily recognized of the Neotropical caddisflies. In the New World, the genus is widely distributed from southern North America through Central and South America, including the Antilles, but excluding souther Chile and adjacent Argentina. The adults of Leptonema are large (10-40 mm) with light brown to light green translucent wings. Some species have small black or dark spots or patterns on the forewings. Larvae of Leptonema build refuges with small silken nets, and this way feed by filtering fine organic particles from the water. The refuges and nets are built with small gravel, sand, and silk. In 1914, Banks reported L. albovirens from Costa Rica, the first record of the genus for Costa Rica. In 1987, Flint et al. provided an exhaustive taxonomic review of the world species, and recognized 15 species groups, five of which were present in Costa Rica. In addition, they described 48 new species, four from Costa Rica, and reported five additional records. Holzenthal added six additional species records, and Munoz-Q. described five new species, of these L. tapanti is the first species in the stigmosum Group defined by Flint et al. and present in the country. In total, 24 species of Leptonema have been previously recorded in Costa Rica. For this research, collections of Leptonema specimens in the University of Minnesota Insect Collection, St. Paul, MN and the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. were examined. In this paper, one additional undescribed species from Costa pica is diagnosed, described and illustrated: Leptonema tica. Diagnoses and illustrations of the male genitalia of the other species are presented. Figures of the larva and adult, as well as aspects of natural history of the genus are included. Finally, an identification key in English and Spanish is provided, together with distribution record maps of all species in Costa Rica are included.",
2679,"Evaluation of Groundwater Leakage into a Drainage Tunnel in Jinping-I Arch Dam Foundation in Southwestern China: A Case Study The Jinping-I double-curvature arch dam, located in the middle reach of Yalong River and with a maximum height of 305 m, is the world's highest dam of this type that has been completed. Since the second stage of reservoir impounding, after which the reservoir water level was gradually raised by about 232 m, a significant amount of leakage was observed from the drainage holes drilled in the lowest drainage tunnel at the left bank abutment at an elevation of 1595 m a.s.l. (above sea level), with an observed maximum pressure of about 0.3 MPa. A number of investigations, including water quality analysis, digital borehole imaging, tunnel geological mapping, and in situ groundwater monitoring, were performed to examine the source of leaking, the groundwater flow paths, and the performance of the grouting curtains. By defining two objective functions using the in situ time series measurements of flow rate and hydraulic head, respectively, a multiobjective inverse modeling procedure was proposed to evaluate the permeability of the foundation rocks that was underestimated in the design stage. This procedure takes advantage of the orthogonal design, finite element forward modeling of the transient groundwater flow, artificial neural network, and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, hence significantly reducing the computational cost and improving the reliability of the inversed results. The geological structures that lead to the leakage were identified and the seepage flow behaviors in the dam foundation and the left bank abutment were assessed. Based on the field measurements and the inverse modeling results, the effects of the engineering treatments of the leakage event on the dam safety were analyzed. It has been demonstrated that the seepage control system is effective in lowering the groundwater level and limiting the amount of seepage in the dam foundation, and the leakage event does not pose a threat to the safety of the dam.",
2680,"Trade-offs between the Economic,Social and Environmental Objectives in Optimal Resource Management in the Fang Watershed, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand The objective of this study was to find the relationships and trade-offs between the citrus farms and the natural resource management at the watershed level. Data collection were done among 149 households in Chai Prakan, Fang and Mae Ai districts, Chiang Mai, Thailand. A weighted multi-goal programming was employed with eight model objectives/goals covering economic, social and environmental aspects. These were maximization of annual equivalent value (AEV) of cropping systems, employment and revenue from non-timber forest products and minimization of revenue variance, dependence from external inputs, expenditure on pesticides, nitrogen use, soil erosion. This study looked at trade-offs between decisions at the farm and watershed level, economic and environmental objectives, economic and social objectives, and social and environmental objectives. If decisions on optimal land use were done at the farm level, farm land in the watershed would be allocated to mixed fruit trees and annual crops while if they were done at the watershed level, land would be planted to fruit trees and some forests and not so much annual crops. Trade-off analysis between different objectives revealed that expenditure on pesticides or nitrogen use as well as soil erosion could be substantially reduced for only a relatively small decrease in the annual equivalent value and employment. On the other hand, employment could not be much reduced without scarifying farmers' income. Nevertheless, further reductions in the environmental goals would lead to rapid rates of reduction in employment and the annual equivalent value. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",
2681,"Does 91% of the world's population really have ""sustainable access to safe drinking water""? Halving the number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water was a core target of the Millennium Development Goals. This led to an unprecedented effort in the water sector, improving the livelihoods of millions of people. While the goal has officially been accomplished, unsuitable benchmarks have led to overstatement of the results. Indicators overemphasize improved water sources, disregarding the fact that many continue to be contaminated, unreliable or unaffordable. The alleged success needs to be reframed to avoid confusion, prevent investments from being reallocated away from the water sector and obtain more accurate estimates of water access.",
2682,"Multivariate statistics and entropy theory for irrigation water quality and entropy-weighted index development in a subtropical urban river, Bangladesh Currently, a well-developed combination of irrigation water quality index (IWQIs) and entropy water quality index (EWQIs) for surface water appraisal in a polluted subtropical urban river is very scarce in the literature. To close this gap, we developed IWQIs by establishing statistics-based weights of variables recommended by FAO 29 standard value using the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) compared with the proposed EWQIs based on information entropy in the Dhaleshwari River, Bangladesh. Fifty surface water samples were collected from five sampling locations during the dry and wet seasons and analyzed for sixteen variables. Principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), Moran's spatial autocorrelation, and random forest (RF) model were employed in the datasets. Weights were allocated for primary variables to compute IWQI-1, 2 and EWQI-1, 2, respectively. The resultant IWQIs showed a similar trend with EWQIs and revealed poor to good quality water, with IWQI-1 for the dry season and IWQI-2 for the wet season is further suggested. The entropy theory recognized that Mg(2+), Cr, TDS, and Cl(-) for the dry season and Cd, Cr, Cl-, and SO(4)(2-) for the wet season are the major contaminants that affect irrigation water quality. The primary input variables were lessened to ultimately shortlisted ten variables, which revealed good performance in demonstrating water quality status since weights have come effectively from PCA than FA. The results of the RF model depict NO(3)(-), Mg(2+), and Cr as the most predominant variables influencing surface water quality. A significant dispersed pattern was detected for IWQImin-3 in the wet season (Moran's I>0). Overall, both IWQIs and EWQIs will generate water quality control cost-effective, completely objective to establish a scientific basis of sustainable water management in the study basin.",
2683,"Local Perceptions of Water-Energy-Food Security: Livelihood Consequences of Dam Construction in Ethiopia The concept of the water-energy-food (W-E-F) nexus has quickly ascended to become a global framing for resource management policies. Critical studies, however, are questioning its value for assessing the sustainability of local livelihoods. These critiques flow in part from the perception that the majority of influential nexus analyses begin from a large-scale, implicitly top-down perspective on resource dynamics. This can lead to efficiency narratives that reinforce existing power dynamics without adequate consideration of local priorities. Here, we present a community-scale perspective on large W-E-F oriented infrastructure. In doing so, we link the current debate on the nexus with alternative approaches to embrace questions of water distribution, political scales, and resource management. The data for this paper come from a survey of 549 households conducted around two large-scale irrigation and hydropower dams in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. The data analysis involved descriptive statistics, logistic analysis, and multinomial logistic analysis. The two case studies presented show that the impact of dams and the perception thereof is socially diverse. Hydropower dams and irrigation schemes tend to enhance social differences and may therefore lead to social transformation and disintegration. This becomes critical when it leads to higher vulnerability of some groups. To take these social factors/conditions into consideration, one needs to acknowledge the science-policy interface and make the nexus approach more political. The paper concludes that if the nexus approach is to live up to its promise of addressing sustainable development goals by protecting the livelihoods of vulnerable populations, it has to be applied in a manner that addresses the underlying causes that produce winners and losers in large-scale water infrastructure developments.",
2684,"Site-Specific Ground Response Analysis of Some Typical Sites in Amaravati Region, Andhra Pradesh, India The influence of local geological and geotechnical characteristics on the scale of ground shaking during the earthquake has been well known for a long time. Typical characteristics of strong ground motion like amplitude, frequency and duration will subject to modify due to the influence of local soil conditions. The continuous modifications in the soil deposits lead to amplify or de-amplify the site. The amplification is one of the major key parameters which is significantly used to account the site effects and considered to design the earthquake-resistant structures. The shear wave velocity (V-s) is one of the most important dynamic properties of the soil and is used to represent the stiffness of the soil deposits. The V-s is significantly used to characterize the ground motion either by simplified site classification method or by prices site-specific ground response analysis (GRA). In this study, an attempt was made to estimate the site response of the Amaravati region, Andhra Pradesh, India. The selected capital region is comes under seismic zone III as per the Bureau of Indian standard code BIS: 1893-2016, with a maximum peak horizontal acceleration value of 0.16 g. To assess the penetration resistance (N) number in the selected region, a total of 65 boreholes have been conducted using standard penetration test (SPT) and the V-s of all the profiles determined using the appropriate existing correlation between V-s and SPT-N. Based on the estimated V-s, the seismic site classification is done according to the national earthquake hazard reduction program and Eurocode 08. To conduct the GRA, a total of nine representative sites have been selected and response analysis is conducted for all selected sites using DEEPSOIL software through the one-dimensional equivalent linear approach. The results from the response analysis of all selected boreholes locations have been presented in terms of acceleration time histories at the surface, variation of peak ground acceleration, site amplification along with the depth of the soil column, response spectra for 5% damping and Fourier amplitude ratio against frequency.",
2685,"Tectono-magmatic evolution of granitoids in the Himalaya and Trans-Himalaya The Himalaya represents an active young mountain belt formed during Tertiary collisional orogeny, and is mainly composed of Indian shield and cover rocks. The granitoids can be traced all along the Himalayan orogen and TransHimalayan belts. They are commonly represented by pre-collision (subduction-related) and syn- to post-collisional granitoids, granite gneisses, leucogranites, and pegmatites. This contribution presents a review on the nature, origin and tectono-magmatic evolution of pre-Himalayan to Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan granitoids and associated mafic rocks using published records. Pre-Himalayan granitoids (ca. 1900-1750 Ma, 900-800 Ma, 550-475 Ma) display calc-alkaline metaluminous (I-type) to peraluminous (S-type) character, which are derived from ancient crustal sources or mixed sources (mantle and crust) in the syn- to post-collisional environments. They have contributed to crustal growth to the northern part of the Indian lithosphere during Columbia, Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinent cycles, which are now tectonically juxtaposed predominantly in the Lesser Himalayan Sequence (LHS) and partly in the Greater Himalayan domain. A few metamorphic records of early Paleozoic thermal events over the Precambrian crystallines can be recognized but they are obliterated due to superimposed Tertiary orogeny. Two episodes of Tertiary (ca. 30-37 Ma, ca. 21-22 Ma) metamorphism, related to crustal shortening and thickening of the Indian plate margin followed by crustal melting and emplacement of leucogranites. The Himalayan leucogranites (ca. 9-25 Ma) are syn- to late kinematic, two-mica granites, and mainly occur in the Higher Himalayan anatectic zone bounded between Main Crystalline Thrust (MCT) in the south and South Tibetan Detachment (STD) in the north, formed by water-fluxed partial melting of metapelitic source, in a wide range of P=4-8 kbar and T=600-850 degrees C. However, high-temperature (similar to 850 degrees C) Himalayan leucogranites probably generated due to asthenosphere upwelling along the convergent plate boundary during post-collision and volcanic arc tectonic environments. Trans-Himalayan magmatic arc in the Ladakh and Karakoram regions represented by Andean-type, calc-alkaline, metaluminous to peraluminous diorites, granitoids, mafic to hybrid microgranular enclaves, syn- to post-magmatic dykes, and volcanics. They originated episodically during ca. 160-50 Ma in the context of northward subduction of Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab below the southern margin of the Asian continent. Detrital zircon ages from post-collisional Indus Group reveals that magmatism within the Ladakh arc continued until ca. 41 Ma, even after the collision of Indian-Asian continents at ca. 55 +/- 10 Ma. They bear signatures of mixing and mingling of crust- and mantle-derived magmas, as well as recycling of Proterozoic-Paleozoic crustal components in their genesis. In the eastern Karakoram and Ladakh, the arc rocks and associated heterogeneous (mixed) source rocks have undergone syn- to post-collisional deformational and melting events, mainly along Karakoram Fault (KF) zone, which produced leucogranite-pegmatite melts forming either dyke network or some at places small stock-like bodies.",
2686,"Analyzing Urban Agriculture's Contribution to a Southern City's Resilience through Land Cover Mapping: The Case of Antananarivo, Capital of Madagascar High urbanization rates in cities lead to rapid changes in land uses, particularly in southern cities where population growth is fast. Urban and peri-urban agricultural land is often seen as available space for the city to expand, but at the same time, agricultural land provides many benefits to cities pertaining to food, employment, and eco-services. In this context, there is an urgent need to provide spatial information to support planning in complex urban systems. The challenge is to integrate analysis of agriculture and urban land-cover classes, and of their spatial and functional patterns. This paper takes up this challenge in Antananarivo (Madagascar), where agricultural plots and homes are interlocked and very small. It innovates by using a methodology already tested in rural settings, but never applied to urban environments. The key step of the analysis is to produce landscape zoning based on multisource satellite data to identify agri-urban functional areas within the city, and to explore their relationships. Our results demonstrate that the proposed classification method is well suited for mapping agriculture and urban land cover (overall accuracy = 76.56% for the 20 classes of level 3) in such a complex setting. The systemic analysis of urban agriculture patterns and functions can help policymakers and urban planners to design and build resilient cities.",
2687,"Nanoscale Gelatinase A (MMP-2) Inhibition on Human Skin Fibroblasts of Longkong (Lansium domesticum Correa) Leaf Extracts for Anti-Aging Leaves of Longkong which collected from Chantaburi in Thailand were extracted by the hot and cold processes using three different solvents including water, chloroform and methanol. The crude extracts were tested for antioxidative activities, tyrosinase inhibition and in vitro cytotoxicity as well as the MMP-2 inhibition activity on human skin fibroblasts for anti-aging evaluation. The hot water crude extract showed the highest antioxidative activities (DPPH radical scavenging, metal ion chelating and lipid peroxidation inhibition) with the SC50, CC50 and IPC50 values of 5.40 +/- 1.23, 32.31 +/- 0.84 and 3.29 +/- 0.30 mg/ml, respectively, and the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity with the IC50 value of 0.49 +/- 0.23 mg/ml. The extract also showed no cytotoxicity on human skin fibroblasts with the cell viability of 80.52 +/- 15.16%. It demonstrated the anti-aging potential by having the pro and active MMP-2 inhibition activity, but lower than ascorbic acid of 1.28 and 1.12 times, respectively. The semi-purified extracts were prepared from this crude extract by solvent-solvent partition. The ethyl acetate soluble fraction showed higher activities (DPPH radical scavenging, metal ion chelating and tyrosinase inhibition) than the crude extract of 23.48, 71.80 and 2.58 times, respectively. This fraction exhibited similar pro and active MMP-2 inhibitory effect to the crude extract. The results from this study have indicated the possible application of the ethyl acetate fraction of the hot water crude extract from leaves of Longkong to be developed as an anti-aging product.",
2688,"The enhancement effect of pre-reduction using zero-valent iron on the solidification of chromite ore processing residue by blast furnace slag and calcium hydroxide A bench scale study was performed to assess the effectiveness of the solidification of chromite ore processing residue (COPR) by blast furnace slag and calcium hydroxide, and investigate the enhancement effect of pre-reduction using zero-valent iron (ZVI) on the solidification treatment. The degree of Cr immobilization was evaluated using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) as well as the solid waste-extraction procedure for leaching toxicity-sulfuric acid & nitric acid method (Chinese standard HJ/T299-2007). Strength tests and semi-dynamic leaching tests were implemented to investigate the potential for reusing the final treatment product as a readily available construction material. The experimental results showed that the performance of pre-reduction/solidification (S/S) was superior to that of solidification alone. After pre-reduction, all of the S/S treated COPR samples met the TCLP limit for total Cr (5 mg L(-1)), whereas the samples with a COPR content below 40% met the pollution control limit of bricks and building block products (Chinese standard HJ/T 301-2007) produced with COPR for total Cr (0.3 mg L(-1)). At the same time, all of the S/S treated specimens tested were suitable for utilization at certain levels.",
2689,"The health hazards of potentially toxic metals in the daily diets of adults and children from a mining and smelting region (Hezhang County) in southwestern China Toxic metals accumulated in the human body are predominantly absorbed by the digestive tract in non-occupationally exposed populations. In the current study, we collected plowed soil samples, and investigated the varied food compositions in a mining and smelting area in southwestern China, to measure the concentrations of ten potentially toxic metals-As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn. We collected information on the daily intakes of these metals to assess the health risks associated with their exposure among children and adults. The urine concentrations of the metals were also measured to obtain data on the amounts present in the body. The results showed that the hazard indexes (HIs) of As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Sr were all larger than 1, for both adults and children; the Zn and Cu values were comparatively higher in children. The intake of staple foods of the region posed the greatest health risk, while drinking water only posed risks clearly associated with As exposure. The urine samples of local residents contained larger amounts of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn, confirming the hazards in the health risk assessment. Obvious differences in the urine metal concentrations between men and women were confirmed. In conclusion, higher concentrations of metals in the surface soil and rain water were the predominant cause of elevated exposure through home-grown crops and produce to accumulate in local residents' bodies.",

2691,"Toward Monitoring Short-Term Droughts Using a Novel Daily Scale, Standardized Antecedent Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index Recent events across many regions around the world have shown that short-term droughts (i.e., daily or weekly) with sudden occurrence can lead to huge losses to a wide array of environmental and societal sectors. However, the most commonly used drought indices can only identify drought at the monthly scale. Here, we introduced a daily scale drought index, that is, the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index (SAPEI) that utilizes precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and also considers the effect of early water balance on dry/wet conditions on the current day. The robustness of SAPEI is first assessed through comparison with two typical monthly indices [Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)] and soil moisture, and then applied to tracking short-term droughts during 1961-2015 for the Pearl River basin in south China. It is demonstrated that SAPEI performs as well as SPEI/self-calibrating PDSI at the monthly scale but outperforms SPEI at the weekly scale. Moreover, SAPEI is capable of revealing daily drought conditions, fairly consistent with soil moisture changes. Results also show that many of the historical short-term droughts over the Pearl River basin have multiple peaks in terms of severity, affected area, and intensity. The daily scale SAPEI provides an effective way of exploring drought initiation, development, and decay, which could be conducive for decision-makers and stakeholders to make early and timely warnings.",
2692,"Efficacy of spirulina extract plus zinc in patients of chronic arsenic poisoning: a randomized placebo-controlled study BACKGROUND: Millions of people in Bangladesh, India, Taiwan, and Chile are consuming high concentration of arsenic through drinking water, and thousands of them have already developed chronic arsenic poisoning. There is no specific treatment. Some authors suggest the use of vitamins and minerals for more than 6 months. The present placebo-controlled double-blind study was conducted to evaluate effectiveness of spirulina extract plus zinc in the treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning. METHODS: Forty-one patients of chronic arsenic poisoning were randomly treated orally by either placebo (17 patients) or spirulina extract (250 mg) plus zinc (2 mg) (24 patients) twice daily for 16 weeks. Each patient was supplied with arsenic-safe drinking water by installing a locally made water filter at household level. Effectiveness of spirulina extract plus zinc was evaluated by comparing changes in skin manifestations (clinical scores), arsenic contents in urine and hair, between the placebo- and spirulina extract plus zinc-treated groups. RESULTS: The concentrations of total arsenic in water (without filtration) of placebo- and spirulina extract plus zinc-treated groups were 150.1 +/- 18.3 and 161.7 +/- 23.9 microg/l, respectively. Intake of these high concentrations of arsenic lead to increased excretion of arsenic in urine (72.1 +/- 14.5 microg/l in placebo-treated group and 78.4 +/- 19.1 microg/l in spirulina plus zinc-treated group). After 2 weeks of using filtered water, there were significant reduction of both arsenic intake through water and urinary arsenic excretion (8.3 +/- 3.6 microg/l and 18.4 +/- 7.3 microg/l in placebo group; 9.7 +/- 5.4 microg/l and 21.6 +/- 5.8 microg/l) in spirulina extract plus zinc-treated group. There was a sharp increase in urinary excretion of arsenic (138 +/- 43.6 microg/l) at 4 weeks following spirulina plus zinc administration and the effect was continued for another 2 weeks. Spirulina extract plus zinc removed 47.1% arsenic from scalp hair. Spirulina extract had no major adverse effect that required physician's attention. The clinical scores (median) for melanosis before and after treatment with placebo was not statistically significant (p > 0.05), whereas in spirulina extract plus zinc-treated group it was statistically significant (p < 0.01). In cases of keratosis, the median clinical scores before and after treatment was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) in placebo-treated group. In spirulina extract plus zinc-treated group, the clinical scores for keratosis before and after treatment was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results show that spirulina extract (250 mg) plus zinc (2 mg) twice daily for 16 weeks may be useful for the treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning with melanosis and keratosis.",
2693,"Effects of Thermal Stratification on the Concentration of Iron and Manganese in a Tropical Water Supply Reservoir Thermal stratification in lakes is an important natural process that can have a significant effect on the water resource quality. The potential changes in chemical contents in water resulting from stratification are the production of ammonia, sulphides and algal nutrients and the increasing concentrations of iron and manganese. One of the water supply reservoirs located in Johor, Malaysia facing with high iron and manganese concentrations associated with the period of stratifications. This study showed that the level of thermal stratification in the reservoir varied at different time of the year. During the strongest period of stratification, the dissolved oxygen content was found to diminish significantly with depth and iron and manganese were recorded at the highest concentrations. Although significant period of rainfalls contributed to the natural destratification of reservoir, lower concentrations of iron and manganese only remained for a shorter period before the concentrations continued to increase with the onset of the thermal stratification. A good understanding on the behaviour of the reservoir may help to identify several measures for the improvement of water quality.",
2694,"Evaluation of nitrogen balance in a direct-seeded-rice field experiment using Hydrus-1D Nitrogen (N) pollution is a global environmental problem that has greatly increased the risks of both the eutrophication of surface waters and contamination of ground waters. The majority of N pollution mainly comes from agricultural fields, in particular during rice growing seasons. In recent years, a gradual shift from the transplanting rice cultivation method to the direct seeding method has occurred, which results in different water and N losses from paddy fields and leads to distinct impacts on water environments. The N transport and transformations in an experimental direct-seeded-rice (DSR) field in the Taihu Lake Basin of east China were observed during two consecutive seasons, and simulated using Hydrus-1D model. The observed crop N uptake, ammonia volatilization (AV), N concentrations in soil, and N leaching were used to calibrate and validate the model parameters. The two most important inputs of N, i.e., fertilization and mineralization, were considered in the simulations with 220 and 145.5 kg ha(-1) in 2008 and 220 and 147.8 kg ha(-1) in 2009, respectively. Ammonia volatilization and nitrate denitrification were the two dominant pathways of N loss, accounting for about 16.0% and 38.8% of the total N input (TNI), respectively. Both nitrification and denitrification processes mainly occurred in the root zone. N leaching at 60 and 120 cm depths accounted for about 6.8% and 2.7% of TNI, respectively. The crop N uptake was 32.1% and 30.8% of TNI during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, respectively, and ammonium was the predominant form (74% of the total N uptake on average). Simulated N concentrations and fluxes in soil matched well with the corresponding observed data. Hydrus-1D could simulate the N transport and transformations in the DSR field, and could thus be a good tool for designing optimal fertilizer management practices in the future.

2695,"A preliminary study of oasis evolution in the Tarim Basin, Xinjiang, China The causes of oasis evolution in the Tarim Basin of north-west China are discussed. Climate change and human activities play different roles in oasis evolution on different temporal scales. The impacts of climate change on oasis evolution are macroscopic and continuous, while the influences of human activities are local and disconnected. The climate of the Tarim Basin, since the late Pleistocene, has tended towards hyper aridity. The existence of oases has depended entirely on the runoff from thawed glaciers and snow, as well as orographic rainfall. Climate change on a geological scale led to variation of runoff flowing into oases. The alteration of water resources caused by climate change, therefore, was the fatal factor for oasis evolution in the Tarim Basin. Climate change was still the principal factor influencing the oasis evolution during historic times although human activities increasingly impacted oasis evolution in the Tarim Basin with the development of the settled human populations. In historic times, the socio-economic prosperity of oases and their expansion occurred largely during warm periods, while desertification and the deterioration of natural resources in oases mainly occurred during cool periods. Continuous trends of aridity brought about the damage of some ancient states in the oases of the Tarim Basin. Changes in oasis environments in modern times are mainly influenced by human activities in the Tarim Basin. Population growth and improvement of socio-economic conditions lead to the rapid expansion of cultivated land with reclamation and evident shrinkage of native vegetation. Irrational reclamation of land and utilization of natural resources in oases by humans have had increasingly destructive effects on oasis environments in modern times. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2696,"Cone-building block-and-ash flows: the Senyama volcanic products of O'e Takayama volcano, SW Japan The Senyama volcanic products of the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene O'e Takayama volcano overlie a 100-m-thick, late Pliocene coastal quartz-sandstone and are intruded by an early Pleistocene dacite dome. The Senyama volcanic products are the remains of a cone that retains a basal part 1.5 km across and 150-250 m high from the substrate. The cone comprises dacite block-and-ash flow deposits and minor base-surge deposits occur at the base. Single beds of the block-and-ash flow deposits are 1-16 m thick and dip inward 20-40 degrees at the base of the cone and inward or outward 10-20 degrees at the summit. Juvenile fragments in the block-and-ash flow deposits are non- to poorly vesicular and commonly have curviplanar surfaces and prismatic joints extending inward from the surfaces, which imply quenching and brittle fracturing of dacite lava. They are variably hydrothermally altered. Nevertheless, juvenile blocks appear to retain a uniform direction of the magnetization vector residual during thermal demagnetization between 280 degrees C and 625 degrees C. At the time of the eruption, the well-sorted sand of the substrate was at the coast and a good aquifer that facilitated explosive interaction of water and the ascending dacite lava. The mechanism of the explosion perhaps involved thermal contraction cracking of the dacite lava, water-inflow into the interior of the lava, and explosive expansion of the water. Initial phreatomagmatic explosions opened the vent. Succeeding phreatomagmatic or phreatomagmatic-vulcanian explosions produced block-and-ash flow deposits around the vent. Hydrothermal silver-ore deposits and manganese-oxide deposits occur in the Senyama volcanic products and the underlying sandstone, respectively. They could represent post-eruptive activity of the hydrothermal system developed in and around the cone.",
2697,"Occurrences of nitrosamines in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water in three representative cities, China An investigation of the occurrence of nine nitrosamines in drinking water following different water treatment processes was conducted using samples from seven drinking water treatment plants in three cities and tap waters in one city in China. The total nitrosamine levels ranged from not detected (n.d.) to 43.45 ng/L. The species and concentrations of the nine nitrosamines varied with disinfection methods and source waters. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which is the nitrosamines of greatest concern, was identified in raw water, disinfecting water, finished water and tap water samples, ranging from 0.8 to 21.6, 0.12 to 24.2, n.d. to 8.8, and n.d. to 13.3 ng/L, respectively. Chloramination alone produced the most significant amounts of NDMA, while ozonation followed by chloramination led to moderately reduced levels. Additionally, chlorination produced relatively less NDMA, while low pressure ultraviolet radiation followed by chlorination could also significantly reduce them. Total organic carbon is one of the most important factors influencing nitrosamines formation in disinfecting water. In contrast, the addition of chlorine following any other disinfection was found to increase the formation of the other eight species of nitrosamines. The three nitrosamines recommended for monitoring by the US EPA were detected in the tap water samples, but most were present at levels below those that pose a risk to human health. Nevertheless, the occurrence and concentration of nitrosamines regulated in the Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List could cause some potential human effects and therefore warrant attention.",
2698,"Morphological and chemical evidence of stromatolitic deposits in the 2.75 Ga Carajas banded iron formation, Brazil We describe evidence of biogenicity in the morphology and carbon content of well-preserved, Neoarchean samples of banded iron formation (BIF) from Carajas, Brazil. Silica-rich BIF layers contain translucent ellipsoidal or trapezoidal structures (similar to 5-10 mu m diameter) composed of silica, hematite, and kerogen, which are arranged in larger ring-like forms (rosettes). Stable carbon isotope analysis yields a delta C-13 value of -24.5% indicating that the contained carbon is likely biogenic. Raman and SEM analyses, as well as wavelength-dispersive X-ray elemental maps, show kerogen inside the rosette forms. Within the iron-rich BIF layers, tubular structures (0.5-5 mu m) were observed between hematite granules and blades. Kerogen and kaolinite are present in these structures. Both the rosettes and the tubular structures resemble morphologies that are characteristic of some bacterial species. We hypothesize that the Carajas BIFs originated as biomats formed by one or more species that over time produced large stromatolitic structures. The rosettes and the tubular structures, associated with chert-rich and iron-rich BIF layers, respectively, may represent two different species, or perhaps, two phases of a bacterium life cycle. For example, some modern myxobacteria exhibit similar morphologies in their resting and vegetative stages. Fe(III) precipitation may have occurred by contact of Fe(II) with bacterial slime, leading to oxidation by chemical reactions with exposed polysaccharide hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. The Fe(III) would then have been available for use as a source of energy in a dissimilatory iron reduction type of metabolism. Organic carbon input presumably came from primary producers (not necessarily aerobic) within the local water column, perhaps in shallow-water communities. Alternatively, the carbon may have originated by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis at ocean hydrothermal vents. The observed lateral continuity of BIF layers may perhaps be explained by chemical signaling by the bacteria of favorable or unfavorable environmental conditions, leading to nearly synchronous cell morphogenesis from a vegetative to resting phase and vice versa.

2699,"INTENSIVE PRAWN FARMING IN THE PHILIPPINES - ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC-IMPLICATIONS The benefits of intensive farming of the giant tiger prawn Peneus monodon in the Philippines are discussed in relation to the environmental costs. Ecological effects include mangrove conversion into ponds; use of antibiotics and chemicals leading to drug resistance; dumping of pond effluents which affect neighboring ecosystems; and pumping of groundwater that causes saltwater intrusion and vulnerability to floods. In addition, these effects lead to social costs in the form of reduction in domestic and agricultural water supplies; decreases in the production of foodfish and other food crops; further marginalization of coastal fishermen; displacement of labor; and credit monopoly by big businessmen. Comparative economic analyses of three prawn-farming systems showed that, compared to extensive and intensive culture, semi-intensive farms give the best performance using undiscounted (payback period, return on investment) and discounted (net present value, internal rate of return) economic indicators. With a 20% fluctuation in inputs or selling price intensive farming will no longer be profitable because of the high variable cost. The paper concludes with recombinations for strict enforcement of existing government guidelines (e.g. ban on mangrove conversion); institution of new policies on the use of groundwater, and public credit; diversification of cultured species; and emphasis on semi-intensive farming parallel with brakes on further intensification of prawn farmings (1).",
2700,"[Uncertainty analysis of water environmental capacity in the nonpoint source polluted river] Based on the one-dimension model for river water environmental capacity (WEC) and the statistical analysis of the measured hydrological and water quality variables, a uncertainty analysis method for the WEC in nonpoint source polluted river was developed, which included the sensitivity analysis for input parameters of the model and the probability distributions analysis for the WEC using Monte Carlo simulation approach. The method, which described the uncertainty derived from the adopted information of the river system and the randomicity from the occurrence of nonpoint source pollution, could provide different WEC combined with reliabilities for different hydrological seasons. As a case study, the total nitrogen (TN) WEC in the Changle River located in southeast China was calculated using the method. Results indicated that the TN WEC with 90% of reliability were 487.9, 949.8 and 1392.8 kg x d(-1) in dry season, average season and flood season, respectively, and the dilution effect of river water flow accounted for the main content of WEC. In order to satisfy water quality target of the river, about 1258.3-3591.2 kg x d(-1) of current TN quantity that entered into the river should be reduced in watershed, and the largest reducing quantity of TN was occurred during flood season. The uncertainty method, which reflected hydrology and water quality variations in the nonpoint source polluted river, provided a more reliable and efficient method for the WEC calculation.",
2701,"Assessing driving factors of regional water use in production sectors using a structural decomposition method: a case study in Jiangsu Province, China A key issue in water resources management in China is the adoption of a total volume control framework of water supply at a regional level corresponding to socioeconomic development. This requires more efficient water demand management in order to achieve a balance between water supply and demand. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a thorough analysis of the water use structure of production sectors in order to identify the major impact factors and thus provide insights for demand management policy design. Taking Jiangsu Province as a case study, we compile a series of extended input-output (I-O) tables at a constant price and establish an I-O structural decomposition model. The major factors leading to change in water use by production sectors (primary, secondary and tertiary) in the Jiangsu Province during five time periods from 1997-2010 are categorized into structure effect, water use efficiency effect, and demand effect for each of three levels: (1) aggregated sectors, (2) sub-aggregated sectors, and (3) individual sectors. Within the study period, the demand effect consistently leads to an increase in water utilization and the increase effect becomes weaker over time, while the other two factors consistently lead to a decrease in water utilization and their dampening effect becomes stronger.",
2702,"Source identification and component characterization of dissolved organic matter in an acid mine drainage reservoir Add mine drainage (AMD) is one of the most serious environmental problems and extreme environments on the earth, with high concentrations of sulphate and dissolved metals. A comprehensive description of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in these reservoirs is lacking, and it can play an important role in AMD pollution treatment and ecosystem. Thus, the source, composition and property of DOM in an AMD reservoir in Ma'an shah, China were studied using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and three-dimension excitadon emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy. The results suggested that the autochthonous algal metabolites significantly contributed to the DOM pool in the AMD reservoir. Bioavailable substances with lower oxidation, unsaturation and aromaticity such as lipids and carbohydrates were lacking in the AMD reservoir especially in the deeper layers. In addition, the proportion of sulfur compounds was significantly higher than that in other waters, suggesting the potential formation of organic matter with sulfur atom in a sulfur-rich environment. These findings underscore that the investigation of DOM in AMD reservoirs may offer references for the AMD treatment with addition of organic matter and broaden the understanding of special carbon cycling in the extreme environment of AMD.

2703,"Symbiotic Nuclear-Coal Systems for Production of Liquid Fuels The notion of safety is not confined to the technological or non-proliferation aspects. It covers also the elements of energy policy: irrational reactions of societies, emotions, egoistic interests of more or less powerful pressure of economical and external political Factors. One Should he conscious that the country's privilege of being equipped by the Nature with rich resources of oil or gas is solely economical, but even more a political one. Simultaneously, the gradual depletion of world hydrocarbons that draws behind irrevocable price increase has to be expected within the time scale of exploitation of power plants (now amounted to similar to 60 years). Therefore consequences of energy policy last much longer than the perspectives the political or economical decision makers are planning and acting within and the public is expecting successes and finally evaluating them. The world oil and gas resources Lire geopolitically very non-uniformity distributed, in contrast to coal and Uranium. Since thee level of energy self-sufficiency of the EU is highest for coal, the old idea of synfuels production from coal is recalled. Yet, ill view of limits to the CO(2) emissions in the EU another method has to be used here than the conventional coal liquefaction applied in China. Simultaneously, all interesting evolution of energy prices was be observed, namely an increase in that of motor fuels in contrast to that of electricity remaining well stable. This Fact suggests that the use of electricity (mainly the off-peak load), generated without emissions of CO(2) for production of liquid fuels can prove reasonable. Thus, the essence of the presented idea of coal-nuclear symbiosis lies in the supply of energy in the form of H(2), necessary for this process, from a nuclear reactor. Particularly, in the present option H2 is obtained by electrolytic water splitting supplying also O(2) as a precious by- product in well mature and commercially available already since decades, Light Water Reactors (LWRs). The direct coal hydrogenation (Bergius method) has been proposed as the optimum process for liquid fuels production, as distinct by the best hydrogen economy, thus reducing the consumption of need nuclear energy. The present concept allows for simultaneous achievement of a number of aims: production of motor fuels without CO(2) emissions (thus without carbon tax) based upon domestic energy carriers - coals, supply of the electricity produced in the nuclear power plant to the national grid to cover the peak demand. Such concept broadens the palette of liquid fuels supply, thus heightens energy safety of the country or e.g. whole of the EU. In an emergency case (for instance - disturbances of gas deliveries) the supply of produced H(2) directly to the gas grid is also not excluded too. The performed preliminary cost evaluation indicates that the coal-nuclear symbiont can be well economic. Finally, the most radical option of coal-nuclear alliance is mentioned - the production of liquid fuels in the Fischer-Tropsch process from CO(2) as a raw material sequestered from a coal power plant. The latter would use the oxy-combustion technique profiting on the O(2) obtained earlier together with H(2) what would facilitate the sequestration of CO(2) at the plant. Unfortunately, this variant requires for reduction of CO(2) to C much more hydrogen, achievable effectively in High Temperature Reactors commercially still unavailable. But on the basis of coal alone great resourcs - natural, technological and human of the coal sector can be best utilized too. Summarizing: the coal-nuclear synergy is the optimum far-sighted concept of safe development of the EU energy and fuels sector.",
2704,"Enhancing Water Supply Resilience in a Tropical Island via a Socio-Hydrological Approach: A Case Study in Con Dao Island, Vietnam Socio-hydrological approaches are gaining momentum due to the importance of understanding the dynamics and co-evolution of water and human systems. Various socio-hydrological approaches have been developed to improve the adaptive capacity of local people to deal with water-related issues. In this study, a social-hydrological approach was developed to enhance the water supply resilience in Con Dao Island, Vietnam. We used a water-balance model, involving the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool, to conduct a scenario-based evaluation of water demands. In doing so, we assessed the impacts of socio-economic development, such as population growth and climate change, on increasing water demand. The modelling results showed that the existing reservoirs-the main sources to recharge the groundwater (accounting for 56.92% in 2018 and 65.59% in 2030)-play a critical role in enhancing water supply resilience in the island, particularly during the dry season. In addition, future water shortages can be solved by investment in water supply infrastructures in combination with the use of alternative water sources, such as rainwater and desalinated seawater. The findings further indicate that while the local actors have a high awareness of the role of natural resources, they seem to neglect climate change. To meet the future water demands, we argue that upgrading and constructing new reservoirs, mobilizing resources for freshwater alternatives and investing in water supply facilities are among the most suitable roadmaps for the island. In addition, strengthening adaptive capacity, raising awareness and building professional capacity for both local people and officials are strongly recommended. The research concludes with a roadmap that envisages the integration of social capacity to address the complex interaction and co-evolution of the human-water system to foster water-supply resilience in the study area.",
2705,"Combined removal of arsenic (V) and fluoride from drinking water by Fe(III)-loading ligand exchange cotton adsorbent The concentration effects of combined removal of arsenate [As(V)] and fluoride (F) were studied by novel bead Fe (III)-loading ligand exchange cotton cellulose adsorbent in batch and column experiments. As(V) and F could be simultaneously removed by the adsorbent from drinking water highly and selectively after three adsorption-regeneration-readsorption cycles. The saturation adsorption capacity of As(V) and F reached up to 15 mg/g. Indexes of effluent were in good agreement with the living drinking water health standard of China, especially the arsenic concentrations below 0.01 mg/L and satisfy WHO stringent drinking water standards., It shows that the adsorbent may be a promising adsorbent in the region of arsenic and fluoride coexisting.",
2706,"Climate change and runoff response based on isotope analysis in an arid mountain watershed of the western Kunlun Mountains Climate change and runoff response were assessed for the Tizinafu River basin in the western Kunlun Mountains, China, based on isotope analysis. We examined climate change in the past 50years using meteorological data from 1957 to 2010. Results of the Mann-Kendall non-parametric technique test indicated that temperature in the entire basin and precipitation in the mountains exhibited significant increasing trends. Climate change also led to significant increasing trends in autumn and winter runoff but not in spring runoff. By using 122 isotope samples, we investigated the variations of isotopes in different water sources and analysed the contributions of different water sources based on isotope hydrograph separation. The results show that meltwater, groundwater and rainfall contribute 17%, 40% and 43% of the annual streamflow, respectively. Isotope analysis was also used to explain the difference in seasonal runoff responses to climate change. As the Tizinafu is a precipitation-dependent river, future climate change in precipitation is a major concern for water resource management.",
2707,"Dendritic Î±-Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposites with improved visible light photocatalytic activity The design and synthesis of unique novel heterostructures for high-performance photocatalytic activity has exerted a tremendous fascination and has recently attracted intensive attention. In this work, a branch-like Î±-Fe2O3/TiO2 heterostructure has been synthesized controllably through an electrospinning method combined with a hydrothermal approach. The backbone of the heterostructure is composed of a 3D porous TiO2 nanofiber (âˆ¼70 nm in diameter) network with plenty of Î±-Fe2O3 nanorods (100-200 nm in length) deposited on them. The novel branch-like nanocomposites have an abundantly porous structure as well as large surface areas (up to 42.8 m(2) g(-1)). In addition, their visible light photodegradation behaviour towards organic dyes, including Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB), eosin red (ER) and methyl orange (MO), was investigated. Their excellent photocatalytic performances are attributed to their large surfaces, improved visible light absorption and high separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons/holes. Furthermore, the degradation process was further studied by varying the amount of Î±-Fe2O3 deposited. The sample Î±-Fe2O3/TiO2-3 possessed the best performance to efficiently decolor CR solution even at a high concentration of 50 mg L(-1) (160 min, 94 mg g(-1)), ascribed to the high adsorption capacity derived from the large surface, strong electrostatic interaction and structural match between Î±-Fe2O3/TiO2-3 and CR. These Î±-Fe2O3/TiO2 heterostructures exhibit great potential for decontamination of organic pollutants in waste water under visible light.",
2708,"Extracting sinkhole features from time-series of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data Sinkholes are significant geologic hazards that are mainly formed in water-soluble carbonate bedrocks such as limestone, dolomite or gypsum. Sinkhole formation causes the surface to subside or collapse suddenly without any prior warning, and therefore can lead to extensive damage and even loss of life and property. Delineating sinkholes is important for understanding hydrological processes and mitigating geological hazards in karst areas. The recent development in deriving high-resolution digital elevation models from space missions such as TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX) enables us to delineate and analyze geomorphologic features and landscape structures at small scale (up to 2 m). In this study we use time-series of TSX/TDX data and develop an adaptive sinkhole-analysis method using interferometry observations. A wavelet-based refinement approach is implemented on interferomeric processing to reduce the baseline bias effects and align the interferometrically-derived DEMs. The multi-temporal DEMs are then successfully stacked using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to reconstruct a higher quality DEM. Finally, feature extraction using watershed algorithm is applied to precisely delineate geomorphometric characteristics of the sinkholes. Five TSX/TDX images are selected to evaluate the performance of our approach for sinkholes in Hamedan, West Iran. Results show that applying our methodology on high-resolution TSX/TDX data from different geometries and time periods enables us to effectively distinguish sinkholes from other depression features of the basin. Different TSX/TDX pairs produce consistent results for diameter and depth of sinkholes with the standard deviation of approximately 1 m, in agreement with field observations.",
2709,"A reappraisal of epeirogenic flexure axes in southern Africa Major drainage divides in southern Africa are interpreted to reflect lines of epeirogenic flexuring of the subcontinent associated with the formation of co-related basins. The Great Escarpment, which separates coastal and inland drainage systems, marks the locus of the Escarpment axis. It was initiated by Early Cretaceous rift flank uplift associated with the break-up Gondwana. Geophysical studies suggest that subsequent erosion, coupled with sedimentation on the continental shelf, would have resulted in progressive inland migration of this flexure. The divide between the Orange-Vaal River system and the Limpopo and Molopo-Nossib-Auob drainage basins is designated the Etosha-Griqualand-Transvaal (EGT) axis. Upper Cretaceous flexuring along this axis disrupted old drainage lines, and initiated deposition of the Kalahari formation. The end-Cretaceous Ovamboland-Kalahari-Zimbabwe (OKZ) axis forms the watershed between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers in Zimbabwe, and separates the latter river system from fossil endoreic drainage lines in the Kalahari, which originally emptied into the Makgadigadi Pans system. In the south of Botswana, this axis is defined by the Kalahari Schwelle, which separates the fossil Kalahari drainages from the Molopo-Nossib River system. Processes responsible for initiating the EGT and OKZ flexures are poorly understood. However, the inferred ages of both these two axes and the Escarpment axis correspond with episodes of alkaline volcanism in southern Africa. This argues for a link between continental flexuring and volcanic activity. Major Pliocene uplift occurred along a line intermediate between the Great Escarpment and the present coastline in the east of the country (the Ciskei-Swaziland axis). More subdued Plio-Pleistocene flexuring along a southwest-northeast axis (designated the Bushmanland-Harts axis) traversing the interior of South Africa was responsible for the formation of major pans ('floors') in Bushmanland and the Orange Free State. There are a number of subordinate lines of uplift (the Khomas, Otavi, and Zoutpansberg axes) which are parallel to the Bushmanland-Harts axis. They are presumably related to the same stress field, and thus probably of similar age. These latter axes are all sub-parallel to active faults in northern Botswana which are interpreted to reflect southwestwards migration of the east African rift system, following lines of structural weakness. Sequential uplift along the axes which have been identified provides a framework for interpreting the evolution of drainages and erosion surfaces on the sub-continent.",
2710,"Effects of fly ash from coal-burning electrical utilities on ecosystem and utilization of fly ash Electric power plants that bum fossil fuels emit several pollutants linked to the environmental problems of acid rain, urban ozone, and the possibility of global climate change. Not only are gaseous and particulate emissions from coal-fired power plants of environmental concern, but also their. byproduct, fly ash may lead to contamination because of the possible release of both major and trace elements. Although there are serious efforts to use fly ashes as construction materials or soil amendments, the amount of the stocked waste ash keeps increasing because production exceeds the amount that can be used in the construction industry. Waste ash that cannot be used in above-mentioned industries needs to be disposed of. The safe disposal of waste ashes requires adequate identification and classification of their heavy metals as well as their toxicity levels. This paper summarizes the effects of the fly ash from coal-burning electrical utilities on ecosystems and provides information about how to beneficially use this kind of ash.",
2711,"THE SHADOW ECONOMY IN THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP COUNTRIES: MODELLING AND ESTIMATING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEEDS TO DEVELOP ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND EASTERN PARTNERSHIP COUNTRIES The paper deals with a highly complicated problem related to the development of economic relations between the European Union and the so-called Eastern Partnership countries - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The essence of the problem is the extremely excessive level of the shadow economy in the Eastern Partnership countries: the shadow economy considerably affects the situation in the Eastern Partnership countries and it causes in addition a profound negative impact on the economic cooperation with the European Union. The assessment and monitoring of shifts in shadow economies in the Eastern Partnership countries is a crucial issue for the European Union, in particular to make responsible and reasoned policy decisions on the economic cooperation between the European Union and the Eastern Partnership countries. This fact leads to the needs to create and use adequate instruments for modelling and evaluating the shadow economy. The opportunities of using various tools for modelling and evaluating the shadow economy are discussed herein. The main focus of attention is directed to the new integrated approach to shadow economy modelling: this approach is distinguished by the fact that the shadow economy is analyzed and assessed in a holistic manner upon taking into account the different aspects of economic life and economic development processes. A new model applicable to the assessment of the shadow economy in the Eastern Partnership countries is described; this model is based on the idea of the so-called Tanzi model and was developed by covering the traditionally used independent variables such as taxes, wages and salaries, as well as the new modified indicators. The paper describes empirical research on modelling and estimating of the scope and dynamics of the shadow economy in the Eastern Partnership countries, as well as the principal results of the said research. It has been shown that the shadow economy in the Eastern Partnership countries is highly, extensively and even dangerously developed. The results of the research show an existence of a link between the size of the shadow economy and the control of corruption, but this link is very diverse in different countries. The methodological approach and research results presented in the paper can be used to create a decision support system for the development of the economic relations between the European Union and the Eastern Partnership countries.",
2712,"Agricultural sustainability under small-holder farming in Kano, northern Nigeria The agricultural sustainability of small-holder agriculture in semi-arid northern Nigeria was assessed. Topsoil (0-30 cm) samples from cultivated and uncultivated soils were analysed for texture, pH, exchangeable cations, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total and available potassium and phosphorus. Comparison of data from cultivated and uncultivated soils revealed that cultivation led to losses of fine soil particles, organic carbon and total nitrogen as well as a reduction in cation exchange capacity and available water-holding capacity. The level of soil clay was shown to have the greatest influence on agricultural sustainability. It is recommended that soil conservation, especially the reduction of soil loss by erosion, should be emphasized in order to enhance agricultural sustainability. (C) 2001 Academic Press.",
2713,"Importance of hydrogeochemical processes in the coastal wetlands: A case study from Edremit-Dalyan coastal wetland, Balikesir-Turkey Investigating the hydrogeochemical properties of wetlands allow us to protect them in a sustainable fashion in global scale. Edremit-Dalyan coastal wetland (EDCW) is located in southern part of Biga Peninsula (Mount Ida) which is the most important eco-tourism center in Turkey. Water sampling was done from the hydrologic basin of coastal wetland that consists of a geothermal site, ore deposits area, treatment facility area and olive tree breeding area. EC values of wetland vary between 440 and 2190 mu S/cm and water type shows a shift from CaHCO3 to NaCISO4. Al, As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn concentrations exceed the tolerance limits in wetland area probably due to ore deposits around the Edremit Plain. Concentrations of As are high in wetland area exceeding both aquatic life and drinking water As standards of 10 mu g/L by as much as 3 times are observed. The dominant As species is As (III). For the living organisms, this situation can be dangerous. Oxygen-18 and deuterium composition of the samples between -7.18 and -6.13 parts per thousand, and between -42.6 and -34.4 parts per thousand respectively in the study area and all the waters are of meteoric origin. Oxygen-18 enrichment can be observed around Derman and coastal zone due to the geothermal activity and evaporation, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2714,"Occurrence and potential human health risks of semi-volatile organic compounds in drinking water from cities along the Chinese coastland of the Yellow Sea Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in drinking water have been considered a severe threat to public health worldwide. However, SVOC contamination and the associated human health risks of the drinking water from cities along tributaries of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River in China have been seldom reported. Here, we focused on the occurrence and distribution of a series of SVOCs, mainly including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and phthalate esters (PAEs), in drinking water of this region. In brief, a total of 31 SVOCs were detectable in all of the drinking water samples, and the total concentrations ranged from 0.92â€¯ng/L to 266.16â€¯ng/L in March and from 24.82â€¯ng/L to 643.93â€¯ng/L in August, with the highest concentrations in Dongtai (DT) and Xinghua (XH), respectively. Spatial and temporal differences of the SVOCs were also observed in drinking water samples, demonstrating the linkage between pollutant profiles and geographical locations, as well as exogenous wastewater discharge. Moreover, PAEs occupied 79.17-100.00% of the total concentrations of SVOCs in drinking water samples collected from the tributaries of the Yangtze River in March, while OCPs were the predominant SVOCs in most of drinking water samples from the tributaries of the Huaihe River. The human health assessment indicated that SVOCs posed negligible non-carcinogenic risks, but residents living in DT, Dafeng (DF), Chengdong (CD), Guanyun (GY) and Lianyungang (LY) may suffer carcinogenic health risks, which could be mainly induced by benzene hexachloride and heptachlor in August.",
2715,"Aqua Solaris - an optimized small scale desalination system with 40 litres output per square meter based upon solar-thermal distillation Classical small scale solar distillers (flat collector solar stills) have been in use especially in remote tropical locations for more than a century, but they only utilize a fraction of the available solar energy flux per area. Our aim was to develop a system that optimizes the energy efficiency and approaches the physical limit of freshwater output as close as possible. The construction takes into consideration the general principles of thermodynamics. The evaporation and (cooled) condensation chambers were separated, the evaporation chamber and surface increasing material were expanded into the third dimension (a collector cubicle instead of flat collector), additional mirrors are applied to increase the solar energy input and for wind protection, and the necessary electronic microcontroller that controls the airflow rhythm was empirically optimized by a long series of test runs and measurements. A prototype on the Island of Bonaire currently produces 40 l of freshwater per square meter surface area at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees C for an estimated life cycle of 20 years. The applications are broad. Each unit can supply a large family with freshwater at low costs.. and the water source can be anything from sea water to water polluted with heavy metals and mineral poisons (e.g. arsenic polluted wells in Bangladesh). The concept builds upon readily available low-cost standard materials and parts and can help to alleviate numerous social and environmental problems, including local dependence on bottled water import, the related garbage build-up on islands and adjacent coral reefs, water borne diseases as well as desertification, deforestation and even unemployment. In addition to scientific and technical details various project proposals, participatory approaches with local end-users and business models are presented.",
2716,"The larvicide pyriproxyfen blamed during the Zika virus outbreak does not cause microcephaly in zebrafish embryos Although the zika virus (ZIKV) has now been strongly correlated with emerging cases of microcephaly in the Americas, suspicions have been raised regarding the use of pyriproxyfen, a larvicide that prevents mosquito development, in drinking water. The effects of this compound on neurodevelopment have not yet been addressed specifically in vertebrates. As a result, we aimed at addressing the effects, if any, of pyriproxyfen on neurodevelopment in the zebrafish embryo as a vertebrate model. Using zebrafish transgenic lines expressing GFP in different cell populations (elavl3 in newborn neurons, gfap and nestin in neural stem cells), we focused on the analysis of whole embryonic brain volume after confocal 3D-reconstruction and the quantification of purified neural stem cells during early neurodevelopment by FACS-cell sorting from whole in vivo embryos. Interestingly, though lethal at very high doses, pyriproxyfen did not cause brain malformation nor any significant changes in the number of observed stem cells in the developing central nervous system. Our data indicate that pyriproxyfen does not affect central nervous system development in zebrafish, suggesting that this larvicide on its own, may not be correlated with the increase in microcephaly cases reported recently.",
2717,"Evaluating urbanization impact on stressed aquifer of Quetta Valley, Pakistan This research is focused on the land use/ land cover (LU/LC) changes impacts on the groundwater table and urbanization trend of Quetta valley for a period of 10 y. The land cover changes are occurring locally, regionally, and worldwide, which results in the expansion of urbanization trend and groundwater table depletion. Population growth leads to fast change in land use patterns, which increases the demand for basic needs. Urbanization and climatic impacts on depleting groundwater resources in Quetta need to assess and find a scientific solution using applications of the latest software. This study investigated the land cover changes in three categories, which were barren land, vegetation, built-up area by using maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Water table depletion was defined in five ranges from very low to very high by using the Kriging Method. It is inferred that the built-up area was increased the most in the last 10 y, that is, 2008-2018 as compared to other classes. The City area groundwater has been observed most of the depletion from 2008 to 2018. The selected Union Councils/Towns of Quetta District coming in the study area were City, Cantonment, Baleli, Kuchlak, Kachi Baig, Hanna, Shadenzai, and Saraghurgai were separated in polygons according to their boundaries to get the population density of each area. The Quetta city was found to be the most populated. It is imperative to inspect the land use change, water levels of current functional pumping wells, and population growth rate annually for its present management and future planning.",
2718,"An integrated, socially equitable design for sustainable water and energy supply in Iran This work deals with two interconnected transitions happening in the Middle East, firstly, the transition towards energy systems with a high share of variable renewable resources; and secondly, the transition towards water systems with a share of supply coming from desalination. This study aims to assess the impacts of these transition plans on social equity in a case study of the southern coast of Iran, where the community faces severe water scarcity and there is ready access to seawater for desalination. The main contribution of this research is to consider social equity as a key factor in the nexus evaluation of energy-water transition plans. Considering different system types (integrated versus separated) and configurations (centralized or decentralized, components, and technologies), it proposes interconnected water-energy transition scenarios with consideration of spatial and temporal changes. In order to achieve more realistic and sustainable water-energy supply planning, the study focuses on a quantitative distributive justice evaluation of the proposed scenarios, with consideration of related social equity theories and Iran's particularities, using the following proxy indicators: subsidies, taxation, job creation, NOx emissions, as well as environmental concerns. In the proposed scenarios with decentralized desalination, shifting a portion of job creation and subsidies for desalination and their renewable energy supply from urban areas and reallocating them to rural areas led to a balance in the distribution of benefits and burdens between rural and urban households, while addressing the issue of excluding rural households from the benefits and opportunities provided by renewable-powered desalination projects.",
2719,"[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons partition in particle-water interface in the Yangtze Estuarine and nearby coastal areas] Based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) field data of particle phase and dissolved phase, partition coefficients Kp in particle-water interface from the Yangtze Estuarine and nearby coastal areas were obtained. The results show partition coefficients of PAHs in dry season were higher than those in flood season, and all of them ranged from 507 L/kg to 10,179 L/kg, increasing with the rise of PAH compounds. The linear free-energy relationship coefficients between Koc value and octanol-water partition coefficients Ko, in dry season and flood season were 0.82 and 0.68, respectively. These relationships inferred that suspended particle matters in the Yangtze Estuarine and coastal areas had weakly lipophilic characteristics and adsorption ability. lgKoc values of PAH compounds in the different sampling sites were higher than the upper limit value predicted by the classic equilibrium partition model. The partition processes of PAHs were not controlled by concentrations of suspended particle matters, particle grain sizes, overlying water salinity and dissolved organic carbon ( R2 < 0.1), but influenced by particle organic carbon and heterogeneous mixtures of particle soot carbon. The expanded partition model which included soot partitioning could well predict in situ partition processes of PAH compounds whose octanol-water partition coefficients lgKow was lower than 6.",
2720,"Hydro-chemical characterization of groundwater and evaluation of health risk assessment for fluoride contamination areas in the eastern blocks of Purulia district, India Purulia is a hard rock terrain where water scarcity as well as water quality degradation has been a major threat for the past few decades. The prolong use of fluoride contaminated groundwater causes serious health issues in human. The study was performed during the post-monsoon period for better understanding of the general geochemistry along with the fluoride contamination of groundwater and analysis of the health risk factor for the local dwellers. The physico-chemical parameters were analysed during the field work and rest in the laboratory using the standard procedures. The statistical mean values of the cations Ca+2; Na+; Mg+2; K+; and Fe+2 are 91.53, 42.3, 31.76, 3.58 and 0.93 mg/l and for anions HCO3-, Cl-, SO4-, NO3- and F- are 231.67, 106.81, 82.83, 31.52 and 4.06 mg/l, respectively. Fluoride is one of the important trace elements in groundwater, and the value ranges from 1.30 to 7 mg/l with an average of 4.06 mg/l in the study region. According to the piper plot, the water type is 80% Ca-HCO3, 19% mixed CaMgCl and 1% CaCl type. Gibbs diagram indicates that the rock-water interaction is the most dominating mechanism prevailing in this region. The health risk assessment is revealed based upon the values of hazard quotient for ingestion (HQ(in)) and dermal pathway (HQ(de)) for the different age groups. The results from the research show that 6-12 months babies are more exposed to health risk through direct consumption of contaminated water in the study region.",
2721,"Developing a correlation index and U disequilibrium factor for the exploratory boreholes in Wahkut block of West Khasi Hills district, Meghalaya (India) With the objective to affirm the apparent uranium ore zone grade/thickness with good confidence for the non-cored as well as those boreholes with poor core recovery in the sedimentary environment of Wahkut block, West Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, a systematic study between the in situ measured gamma-ray logs under field conditions and laboratory analyzed core assay under controlled conditions has been carried out. The study area spans 2 sqkm having 33 cored and 39 non-cored boreholes with a cumulative drilled depth of about 11,000 m. On this available cored borehole database, simultaneous uranium ore zone continuity, both for in situ gamma-ray logs and radiometric core assay, was evaluated with the experimental parameters of 1.0 m ore zone thickness at 0.010% eU(3)O(8) cut off grade. A population of 18 such simultaneous qualifying zone (borehole log and core assay) across the 15 cored boreholes gave a grade thickness continuity index of 0.92 with a moderately strong relationship between the radiometric core assay and the in situ gamma-ray logs. After validation of an in situ uranium ore zone, study boreholes were examined for their uranium disequilibrium status by fitting regression equations for the radiometric U3O8(beta/gamma) and spectrometric radium measurements, done on the borehole core samples. A parent favoring uranium disequilibrium was observed in the sedimentary environment of Wahkut block, with a log normal distribution. An average uranium disequilibrium factor 1.46 +/- 0245 was estimated for the 19 study boreholes, across the block. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2722,"The Influence of Different Forest Characteristics on Non-point Source Pollution: A Case Study at Chaohu Basin, China Forestland is a key land use/land cover (LULC) type that affects nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, and has great impacts on the spatiotemporal features of watershed NPS pollution. In this study, the forestland characteristics of the Chaohu Basin, China, were quantitatively represented using forestland types (FLTs), watershed forest coverage (WFC) and forest distance from the river (DFR). To clarify the impact of forests on NPS pollution, the relationship between forestland characteristics and watershed nutrient outputs (TN and TP) was explored on a monthly scale using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and the period simulation was 2008-2016. The results showed that: (1) the TN and TP showed similar output characteristics and the rainy season was the peak period of nitrogen and phosphorus output. (2) Among the forestland characteristics of forestland types, watershed forest coverage and forest distance from the river, watershed forest coverage and forest distance from the river had greater effects than forestland types on the control of watershed nutrient outputs (TN and TP). (3) In different forestland types, the watershed nutrient outputs intensity remained at the lowest level when the FLTs was mixed forest, with a TN output of 1244.73kg/km(2) and TP output of 341.39 kg/km(2). (4) The watershed nutrient outputs and watershed forest coverage were negatively correlated, with the highest watershed forest coverage (over 75%) reducing the TN outputs by 56.69% and the TP outputs by 53.46% compared to the lowest watershed forest coverage (below 25%), it showed that in areas with high forest land coverage, the non-point source pollution load in the watershed is smaller than in other areas. (5) forest distance from the river had an uncertain effect on the TN and TP output of the basin, the forestland itself is a source of pollution, but it also has the function of intercepting pollution movement; the forest distance from the river in the range of 500-1000 m had the lowest NPS pollution. Considering the different forest characteristics and topographical factors, an optimal allocation mode of differentiated forest land was proposed, these suggestions will provide a scheme for surface source pollution prevention and control in the basin. This research gap is the basis of real forestland optimization. We may optimize the forestland layout for NPS pollution prevention and control by clarifying the internal mechanism.",
2723,"Radon activity measurements in irrigation water from Qassim Province by RAD7 The present study deals with investigating radon level in groundwater, which is being used for irrigation in the environs of Qassim province, Saudi Arabia. Ninety nine samples of groundwater were collected from eight cities in Qas-sim province. Radon concentrations in the collected water samples were measured with RAD7 electronic radon detector connected to RAD-H2O accessory (Durridge Co., USA). The concentration of mRn in 99 irrigation groundwater samples ranged from 1.20 to 15.43 Bql(-1) Radon level in 5 samples 2 from Al-Asyah, 2 from Al shamasia and one sample from Al Moznib exceeded the permissible level of radon 11 Bql(-1) in groundwater. The total annual effective dose varied with increase in radon concentration. The calculated effective dose per liter (EDL) and annual effective dose (AED) ranged from 6.1 to 77.15 nSvL(-1) and 4.45 to 56.16 mu sv y(-1), respectively. It was evident that the total annual effective doses resulting from radon in 95% from groundwater in Qassim area were significantly lower than the permissible limit of 1 mSv y(-1) for the public.",

2725,"Virtual Permanent Establishments: Indian Law and Practice The virtual permanent establishment (virtual PE) was first proposed to tackle growing concerns that multinationals could artificially avoid PE status by rendering cross border supplies of goods and services through electronic means. The virtual PE concept therefore sought to link taxation with value creation: in most cases, this involved the application of source taxation to non-resident entities that had no physical presence in the source state. With increasing digitalization, the virtual PE concept has become crucial to addressing tax avoidance and base erosion, particularly by multinational enterprises and cross border suppliers of goods and services. This article(1) traces the evolution and treatment of the virtual PE concept under Indian law against the background of the broad framework prescribed under international and comparative tax law. Based on an analysis of Indian judicial precedents on the topic, the authors believe that Indian courts have progressively watered down the requirements necessary to trigger the existence of a PE. Although the lowering of thresholds is in the context of digital businesses where the courts have sought to tax income in India through any tangible or physical nexus, the lower thresholds could arguably be applied in other situations. Furthermore recent reservations by India to the revised OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (OECD Model) and changes in the domestic tax laws introduced in the 2018 Budget also indicate an intent to lower the threshold for the creation of nexus, for both digital and other businesses operating in the Indian market. This potentially raises the level of uncertainty with regard to many transactions which, in the past, were not questioned as being undertaken by a PE and which may, in certain instances, lead to absurd results. Additionally, the struggle between adopting a multilateral solution such as the virtual PE appears to be slowly giving way to uncoordinated and unilateral levies, such as India's recent equalization levy. Several European countries are now considering similar unilateral measures. This would lead to double taxation, have a chilling effect on cross border trade, and undercut the foundation of the international tax order by bypassing a stable and clear treaty network. Therefore, there is a need to address the complexity of the concept of a virtual PE and achieve consensus before the world crosses a tipping point, after which unilateral solutions may become the norm. From an Indian perspective as well, this is crucial if India is to achieve its publicly stated goal of a USD 1 trillion digital economy in the next four years.",
2726,"Analysis of arsenic-contaminated groundwater domain in the Nadia district of West Bengal (India) An analysis of groundwater flow and transport processes of arsenic in the flow domain of the Yamuna sub-basin located in West Bengal (India) is presented. The objectives of the analysis are: to conceptualize the groundwater flow domain, to determine groundwater flow paths and groundwater velocities, to study arsenic transport in the flow domain, and to study the well captures zones. The first three objectives and issues are addressed by simulation of steady and transient groundwater flow and contaminant transport using the US Geological Survey three-dimensional finite difference code, MODFLOW, and the three-dimensional advective-dispersive transport code, MT3D. Simulated results of the calibrated model replicate the observed monthly water table conditions perfectly. Contaminant transport analysis indicates an in situ arsenic source. Using the particle tracking algorithm, MODPATH, the possibility of arsenic removal from a sample key location, and the design of wells for withdrawing arsenic-free groundwater are studied through analysis of the well capture zones.",
2727,"Irrigation in the Tarim Basin, China: farmers' response to changes in water pricing practices The extremely arid Tarim Basin in northwestern China is an important cotton and fruit production region. However, extensive agricultural land reclamation combined with unreasonable water use in recent decades resulted in degradation of ecosystems along the Tarim River. With declining water availability, it is becoming increasingly important to utilize this essential resource more efficiently. Water pricing is considered an effective way to advance water allocation and water conservation. To identify whether a strong increase in water price may lead to a wiser agricultural water use along Tarim River, 128 farmers were interviewed with structured questionnaire in different parts of the Basin. Multinomial logistic regression was employed to explain the factors influencing farmers' reaction towards a strong increase in water price. The results show that under increased water price less than half of the interviewed farmers would opt for decisions that lead to improved water use efficiency. Moreover, the price increase might lead to a further expansion of groundwater exploitation in the region. Fruit farmers, as well as farmers with less land and less cash income are reluctant to adopt advanced irrigation technology or improve their crop production in reaction to increased water price. It was furthermore revealed that the experience of slight water shortage in the past created awareness by farmers to use water more wisely. It is concluded that the sole increase of water price is not a viable option; an integrated approach is necessary, in which creation of awareness and improving agronomic skills of farmers play a key role to overcome the tight water situation and realize a more efficient use of water.",
2728,"The impact of an underground cut-off wall on nutrient dynamics in groundwater in the lower Wang River watershed, China Underground cut-off walls in coastal regions are mainly used to prevent saltwater intrusion, but their impact on nutrient dynamics in groundwater is not clear. In this study, a combined analysis of multiple isotopes ([Formula: see text]) and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations is used in order to assess the impact of the underground cut-off walls on the nutrient dynamics in groundwater in the lower Wang River watershed, China. Compared with the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in groundwater downstream of the underground cut-off walls, high [Formula: see text] and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations and similar concentration levels of [Formula: see text] and total dissolved phosphorus are found in groundwater upstream of the underground cut-off walls. The isotopic data indicated the probable occurrence of denitrification and nitrification processes in groundwater upstream, whereas the fingerprint of these processes was not shown in groundwater downstream. The management of fertilizer application is critical to control nitrogen concentrations in groundwater restricted by the underground cut-off walls.",
2729,"Characterizing Urban Fabric Properties and Their Thermal Effect Using QuickBird Image and Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared (TIR) Data: The Case of Downtown Shanghai, China The combined usage of high-resolution satellite images and thermal infrared (TIR) data helps understanding the thermal effect of urban fabric properties and the mechanism of urban heat island (UHI) formation. In this study, three typical urban functional zones (UFZs) of downtown Shanghai were chosen for quantifying the relationship between fine-scale urban fabric properties and their thermal effect. Nine land surfaces and 146 aggregated land parcels extracted from a QuickBird image (dated 14 April 2014) were used to characterize urban fabric properties. The thermal effect was deduced from land surface temperature (LST), intra-UHI intensity, blackbody flux density (BBFD) and blackbody flux (BBF). The net BBF was retrieved from the Landsat 8 TIR band 10 dated 13 August 2013, and 28 May 2014. The products were resampled to fine resolution using a geospatial sharpening approach and further validated. The results show that: (1) On the UFZ level, there is a significant thermal differential among land surfaces. Water, well-vegetated land, high-rises with light color and high-rises with glass curtain walls exhibited relatively low LST, UHI intensity and BBFD. In contrast, mobile homes with light steel roofs, low buildings with bituminous roofs, asphalt roads and composite material pavements showed inverse trends for LST, UHI intensity, and BBFD; (2) It was found that parcel-based per ha net BBF, which offsets the ""size-effect"" among parcels, is more reasonable and comparable when quantifying excess surface flux emitted by the parcels; (3) When examining the relationship between parcel-level land surfaces and per ha BBF, a partial least squares (PLS) regression model showed that buildings and asphalt roads are major contributors to parcel-based per ha BBF, followed by other impervious surfaces. In contrast, vegetated land and water contribute with a much lower per ha net BBF to parcel warming.",

2731,"[Isolation and identification of Sulfobacillus sp. strains and their application in pyrite bioleaching] OBJECTIVE: The work aimed to isolate and culture the acidophilic and moderately thermophilic microorganisms for leaching the sulfide ore. METHODS: We enriched and incubated iron- or sulfur-oxidizing strains from muddy water of acuric hot spring utilizing ferrous irons or elemental sulfur as substrates. Then, we identified the strains by their morphological, physiological, biochemical properties and phylogenetic positions, and estimated their bioleaching potential according to their oxidation rate of pyrite. RESULTS: Two acidophilic, aerobic and facultative heterotrophic bacterial strains, Costa C and Costa E, were isolated from the samples of sulfuric hot springs of Costa Rica. Cells of the two strains were gram-positive, spore-forming and rod-shaped [(0.4 - 0.6) microm x (2.5 - 4.0) microm and (0.4 - 0.7) microm x (2.4 - 4.9) microm, respectively]. Strain Costa C grew at a temperature range of 30 degrees C - 55 degrees C and a pH range of 1.2 - 5.0, optimally at 50 degrees C and 2.8. Strain Costa E grew at a temperature range of 30 degrees C - 55 degrees C and at a pH range of 1.4 - 5.0, optimally at 40 degrees C and 2.8. Two strains could autotrophically grow on inorganic substrates such as ferrous irons, element sulfur and K2 S4 O6 and also could utilize organic substrates like yeast extract for heterotrophic growth. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences alignment demonstrated that the highest similarity between strain Costa C, Costa E and other species of the genus Sulfobacillus was above 99%. CONCLUSION: Based on morphological, physiological and biochemical analysis, Costa C and Costa E can be affiliated to the genus Sulfobacillus, for which the names Sulfobacillus sp. strain Costa C and Sulfobacillus sp. strain Costa E were proposed. Both strains could oxidize pyrite, and the oxidation rates arrived 63.0 mg/L x d and 56.8 mg/L x d, respectively.",
2732,"Epidemiology and molecular relationships of Cryptosporidium spp. in people, primates, and livestock from Western Uganda BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium is one of the most common parasitic diarrheal agents in the world and is a known zoonosis. We studied Cryptosporidium in people, livestock, and non-human primates in the region of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Land use change near the park has resulted in fragmented forest patches containing small, remnant populations of wild primates that interact intensively with local people and livestock. Our goal was to investigate risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and to assess cross-species transmission using molecular methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Diagnostic PCR revealed a prevalence of Cryptosporidium of 32.4% in humans, 11.1% in non-human primates, and 2.2% in livestock. In the case of humans, residence in one particular community was associated with increased risk of infection, as was fetching water from an open water source. Although 48.5% of infected people reported gastrointestinal symptoms, this frequency was not significantly different in people who tested negative (44.7%) for Cryptosporidium, nor was co-infection with Giardia duodenalis associated with increased reporting of gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal consistency was no different in infected versus uninfected people or animals. DNA sequences of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein gene placed all infections within a well-supported C. parvum/C. hominis clade. However, the only two sequences recovered from primates in the core of the park's protected area fell into a divergent sub-clade and were identical to published sequences from C. parvum, C. hominis, and C. cuniculus, suggesting the possibility of a separate sylvatic transmission cycle. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Cryptosporidium may be transmitted frequently among species in western Uganda where people, livestock, and wildlife interact intensively as a result of anthropogenic changes to forests, but the parasite may undergo more host-specific transmission where such interactions do not occur. The parasite does not appear to have strong effects on human or animal health, perhaps because of persistent low-level shedding and immunity.",
2733,"Increased firm profitability under a nationwide environmental information disclosure program? Evidence from China Environmental information disclosure has been widely used as an approach of pollution reduction. But its impact on firms' competitiveness is not adequately studied in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper empirically investigates how China's first national environmental information disclosure program affects the profitability of a panel of Chinese industrial firms using China's annual surveys of manufacturing firms and its pollution information transparency indexes at the city level. We find that stricter environmental disclosure in China leads to increased firm profitability, lending support to the Porter hypothesis. And the results are robust to various robustness checks. In addition, the results show that the environmental disclosure program in China increases industrial firms' propensity to innovate as well as innovating firms' innovation intensity. Thus, the findings of this paper provide more rationales for governments to use environmental information disclosure as a mean of pollution reduction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2734,"Isotope and minor element geochemistry of high arsenic groundwater from Hangjinhouqi, the Hetao Plain, Inner Mongolia High As groundwater is widely distributed in the northwestern Hetao Plain, an and region with slow groundwater flow. Arsenic concentration in groundwater ranges from 1 to 1000 mu g/L. Most water samples have elevated salinities, with Cl and/or HCO3 as the dominant anions and Na as the dominant cation. High concentrations of As in shallow aquifers are associated with strongly reducing conditions, as evidenced by high concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), NH4, dissolved sulfide, arsenite and dissolved CH4, and relatively low concentrations of NO3- and SO42-. Results of the hydrochemical, and H and O isotope geochemical studies indicate that evapotranspiration is an important process controlling the enrichment of Na and Cl as well as trace elements such as As, B, F and Br in groundwater. In NaHCO3-dominated groundwaters, As, B and F were enriched. Decades of irrigation using Yellow River water has resulted in elevation of the groundwater level, which has accelerated salt accumulation in shallow groundwater and surface soil. In addition, irrigation is responsible for the release of some components from aquifer materials and mixing with saline groundwaters, as indicated by minor element and isotope geochemical data. Used to trace groundwater flow paths, Sr isotope composition also indicates that bedrock weathering is one of the primary sources of As in groundwater in the study area. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

2735,"Rapid growth of mineral deposits at artificial seafloor hydrothermal vents Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential resources for base and precious metals (Cu-Pb-Zn +/- Ag +/- Au), but difficulties in estimating precise reserves and assessing environmental impacts hinder exploration and commercial mining. Here, we report petrological and geochemical properties of sulphide chimneys less than 2 years old that formed where scientific boreholes vented hydrothermal fluids in the Iheya-North field, Okinawa Trough, in East China Sea. One of these infant chimneys, dominated by Cu-Pb-Zn-rich sulphide minerals, grew a height of 15 m within 25 months. Portions of infant chimneys are dominated by sulphate minerals. Some infant chimneys are sulphide-rich similar to high-grade Cu-Pb-Zn bodies on land, albeit with relatively low As and Sb concentrations. The high growth rate reaching the 15 m height within 25 months is attributed to the large hydrothermal vent more than 50 cm in diameter created by the borehole, which induced slow mixing with the ambient seawater and enhanced efficiency of sulphide deposition. These observations suggest the possibility of cultivating seafloor sulphide deposits and even controlling their growth and grades through manipulations of how to mix and quench hydrothermal fluids with the ambient seawater.",
2736,"Assessing spatiotemporal variation in actual evapotranspiration for semi-arid watersheds in northwest China: Evaluation of two complementary-based methods Water vapor generated locally by actual evapotranspiration (AET) is important both to the recycling of water regionally and to the long term sustainability of desert-oases in the semi-arid-to-arid region of northwest (NW) China. An accurate assessment of AET is central to describing the hydrologic status of watersheds. Conventional methods of estimating AET from meteorological point data are generally not appropriate for regions with high spatial variability, particularly with respect to landcover and topography. Insufficient monitoring stations make it particularly difficult to estimate AET that is spatially representative of large areas. The objective of this study was to estimate spatially-distributed monthly AET for a complex landscape, consisting of deserts, oases, and mountains, with climate and landcover data generated primarily from remote sensing (RS) data. In this study, we used two complementary relationship (CR)-based methods to estimate monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and AET over a 10-year period (2000-2009) for two large watersheds in NW China. In evaluating the performance of CR-based methods, we compared point-estimates of ETo and AET generated with the two methods (generated either by using climate-station data or by extracting point-estimates from end products produced from RS-data) against (i) climate-station-based estimates of ETo calculated with the FAO Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation and from pan-evaporation data, and (ii) geographically-corresponding point-estimates of AET extracted from the MODIS global product of AET (MOD16) recently developed by Mu et al. (2011, Remote Sensing of Environment, 115, 1781-1800). Point-extractions of AFT from MOD16-products were the least representative, when compared to ETo and AET calculated with the other methods. Between CR-based methods, the Venturini et al. (2008, Remote Sensing of Environment, 112, 132-141) method provided the best comparison with ETo calculated with the P-M equation and from pan-evaporation data. Due to its independence from wind velocity, the Venturini method is rated the most suitable for regional application, especially for the complex landscapes of NW China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

2737,"Comparison of Translocation and Transformation from Soil to Rice and Metabolism in Rats for Four Arsenic Species Arsenic (As) is ubiquitously present in the environment. The toxicity of As is related to its forms. This study was designed to compare the translocation and transformation of four As species from soil to rice, and metabolism in rats for four arsenic species. A set of 26550 data was obtained from pot experiments of rice plants grown in soil fortified with four As species, and 4050 data were obtained from rat experiments in which 81 rats were administered with the four As species. The total As in grain from the methyl arsenate fortified soil was 6.1, 4.9, and 5.2 times that from As(III), As(V), and dimethyl arsenate fortified soil, respectively. The total As in husk was 1.2-7.8 times greater than that in grain. After oral administration of each As species to rats, 83-96% was accumulatively excreted via feces and urine, while 0.1-16% was detected in blood. The translocation, transformation, and metabolism of different forms of arsenic vary greatly.",
2738,"Phylogenetic diversity of bacteria in the leachate of a full-scale recirculating landfill We analyzed the phylogenetic composition of bacterial community in the effluent leachate of a full-scale recirculating landfill using a culture-independent molecular approach. 16S rRNA genes were amplified directly from leachate DNA with universally conserved and Bacteria-specific rDNA primers and cloned. The clone library was screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism, and representative rDNA sequences were determined. Many bacterial sequences displaying relatively low levels of similarity to any other hitherto reported rDNA sequences were retrieved. A total of 103 bacterial sequence types were found in 195 analyzed clones. Roughly 90% of the sequence types were affiliated with low-G + C gram-positive bacteria, the Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia group and with the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group, where the clone distribution was 53%, 21% and 19%, respectively. The other 10 sequence types represented 7% of the total clones, and they were either affiliated with well-recognized bacterial divisions Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, or grouped within two recently proposed candidate divisions OP9 and OP11. The most frequent sequence type represented less than 10% of the total bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the 15 more frequent sequence types accounted for at least 47% of these sequences. Some rRNA gene sequences clustered with genera or taxa that were classically identified within anaerobic treatment systems. These results indicate that, despite recent expansion, our knowledge on the microbial diversity in anaerobic treatment systems is still limited.",
2739,"Effect of PVC and iron materials on Mn(II) deposition in drinking water distribution systems Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and iron pipe materials differentially impacted manganese deposition within a drinking water distribution system that experiences black water problems because it receives soluble manganese from a surface water reservoir that undergoes biogeochemical cycling of manganese. The water quality study was conducted in a section of the distribution system of Tegucigalpa, Honduras and evaluated the influence of iron and PVC pipe materials on the concentrations of soluble and particulate iron and manganese, and determined the composition of scales formed on PVC and iron pipes. As expected, total Fe concentrations were highest in water from iron pipes. Water samples obtained from PVC pipes showed higher total Mn concentrations and more black color than that obtained from iron pipes. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that manganese was incorporated into the iron tubercles and thus not readily dislodged from the pipes by water flow. The PVC pipes contained a thin surface scale consisting of white and brown layers of different chemical composition; the brown layer was in contact with the water and contained 6% manganese by weight. Mn composed a greater percentage by weight of the PVC scale than the iron pipe scale; the PVC scale was easily dislodged by flowing water. This research demonstrates that interactions between water and the infrastructure used for its supply affect the quality of the final drinking water.",
2740,"Reply to the comment on ""Sequence stratigraphy and onlap history of the Donets Basin, Ukraine: Insight into Carboniferous icehouse dynamics"" Ruban (this issue) raises two concerns regarding the onlap-offlap curve recently published by Eros et al. (2012) for the Donets Basin. One issue questions the use of the Carboniferous timescale presented in Eros et al. (2012) given that it differs from that of the Geologic Time Scale 2004 (Davydov et al., 2005). The second issue addresses three discrepancies between the Donets curve and ""the available global eustatic curve"" of Haq and Schutter (2008), bringing into question the degree to which the Donets onlap-offlap history might record regional tectonism to continental-scale mantle dynamics over glacioeustasy. The Carboniferous timescale (Davydov et al., 2010) used by Eros et al. (2012) incorporates new high-precision ID-TIMS U-Pb dates from tonsteins collected throughout the Donets Basin that are tied to stratigraphic sections and sequences referenced in Eros et al. (2012). This time-scale forms the basis of the Carboniferous interval in the latest edition of the Geologic Timescale 2012 (Davydov et al., 2012), which we consider the most appropriate for use in Carboniferous studies. Here we present a high-resolution correlation between the onlap and sea-level histories for the U.S. Midcontinent (Ross and Ross, 1987; Heckel, 2008), the Donets Basin, and the Pennine Basin (Waters and Condon, 2012) made possible by recently published chronostratigraphic constraints (Davydov et al., 2010; Schmitz and Davydov, 2012). This robust chronostratigraphically constrained comparison argues for a dominant eustatic driver on the observed hierarchy of stratigraphic cyclicity and inferred sea level variations on the 10(5) and 10(6)-year scale in minimally the cross-Pangaean paleotropical regions. Existing discrepancies between these correlated records and the Late Paleozoic record of 'modal mean of change in sea level' (Haq and Schutter, 2008) awaits future inter-regional correlations of radiometrically and biostratigraphically well-constrained Carboniferous successions.

2741,"Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation with AHP and entropy methods and health risk assessment of groundwater in Yinchuan Basin, northwest China Water quality evaluation and health risk assessment are not only the basis of environmental protection work, but also of great significance to water environment supervision and management. In this paper, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for water quality was improved by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Entropy, and a health risk assessment model based on triangular fuzzy theory was developed. The evaluation results show 5 water categories: Class-1 (nÂ =Â 1, 2%), Class-2 (nÂ =Â 14, 32%), Class-3 (nÂ =Â 15, 34%), Class-4 (nÂ =Â 8, 18%) and Class-5 (nÂ =Â 6, 14%), manifesting about 67% of the phreatic water can be used for drinking purposes in the research area. The Chadha diagram provides hydrochemical facies of the phreatic water are mainly NaCl type (nÂ =Â 16, 36%) and Ca-Mg-Na type (nÂ =Â 15, 34%). Fluorine as non-carcinogenic factor in health risk assessment, showing moderate correlation with SO(4)(2)(-) (rÂ =Â 0.54) and low correlation with Na+ (rÂ =Â 0.38) in Pearson correlation analysis. The order of non-carcinogenic risk per year is as follow: Class-2, Class-3, All, Class-4 and Class-5 with the mean of 0.29, 0.51, 0.67, 0.86 and 1.55Â Ã—Â 10(-8) for adults, 0.54, 0.95, 1.27, 1.58 and 2.89Â Ã—Â 10(-8) for children. Compare with adults, children undertake higher health risk, in research area. Particularly, the region accepting Class-5 water supplement encounter high non-carcinogenic risk, where risk level is 2.24 and 2.28 times to the average risk level for adults and children, respectively. This paper provides insights into solving uncertainties in groundwater management and environmental protection, as well as into fuzzy logic techniques addressing pollution.",
2742,"Metal mining and natural protected areas in Mexico: Geographic overlaps and environmental implications Because the high biodiversity of Mexico about 12% of the country's total area is included as a Natural Protected Areas (NPAs); however, in the last years, according to the official data, an astonishing number of mining concessions covering 28% of the total area of the country has been granted already. The objective of this work is to quantify the geographical overlap of mining concessions with the federal NPAs of Mexico including the exploration/exploitation status of minerals to be extracted. We use geo-referenced polygons of the NPAs and those of mining exploration and exploitation concessions until 2010 and calculated their overlap extension with the application of ArcView GIS 3.3 (ESRI; Redland, CA, U.S.A.). Our results showed that a total of 1609 mining concessions covering an area of 1,486,433 ha geographically overlaps with the NPAs. With the exception of Natural Monuments (NM), all the different categories of NPAs in Mexico showed mining concessions; 75% of Natural Resources Protection Area (NRPA); 63% of Biosphere Reserve (BR); 47% of Protected Area for Flora and Fauna (PAFF); 22% of Sanctuary (S); and 15% of National Park (NP). The impacts of metal mining activities on NPAs are not only limited to biodiversity and affectation to human communities, but they also have a radius of influence not yet evaluated since most of the NPAs have a special role in supplying watersheds and aquifers. Obviously, currently in Mexico a NPA decree does not represent an obstacle to megamining projects; in consequence, their real environmental impacts are underestimated. It is a priority to legally support canceling the mining concessions already granted in the NPAs and stop granting new ones in the future. In the proportion to which environmental authorities continue to openly accept mining concessions within the NPAs, through modifying management programs that allow these activities, they may cause a significant increase in rejections of local people toward the changes in management programs and on the promotion of new NPAs in Mexico.

2743,"Nitrogen transformation and pathways in the shallow groundwater-soil system within agricultural landscapes The present study considers the behavior of nitrogen compounds in the shallow groundwater-soil system as necessary for the functioning of the nitrogen cycle within agricultural landscapes and one of the first steps of the formation of groundwater chemical composition. Data were collected in 2011-2018 within the Poyang Lake area (Jiangxi Province, China), where agricultural landscapes prevail. The soil and groundwater samples were taken in different periods of an agricultural season at the beginning of the agricultural season (spring) and after harvesting (autumn). The combined geochemical data on the chemical and microbiological composition of the soils and shallow groundwater and isotopic data on dissolved nitrate allowed researchers to resolve that nitrogen enters the system in the form of organic compounds, particularly, due to the soil fertilization at the beginning of the agricultural season. Organic nitrogen compounds transform into nitrate under the influence of nitrifiers in the soil before getting the shallow aquifer, where the occurrence of denitrification is suggested. Within the Ganjiang and Xiushui interfluve, reducing conditions, together with the formation of clay minerals from the aqueous solution, may serve a geochemical barrier for the accumulation of nitrogen compounds preventing the transformation of ammonium to nitrate and providing its sorption. It also should be noted that bacterial diversity in the shallow groundwater has a strong relation with the amount of nitrate in the system, whereas in the soil, it is connected with sampling depth.",
2744,"Inequitable allocation of deep community wells for reducing arsenic exposure in Bangladesh Community wells that extend deeper than most private wells are crucial for reducing exposure to groundwater arsenic (As) in rural Bangladesh. This study evaluates the impact on access to safe drinking water of 915 such intermediate (90-150 m) and deep (>150 m) wells across a 180 km(2) area where a total of 48,790 tubewells were tested with field kits in 2012-13. Half the shallow private wells meet the Bangladesh standard of 50 mu g/L for As in drinking water, whereas 92% of the intermediate and deep wells meet the more restrictive World Health Organization guideline for As in drinking water of 10 mu g/L. As a proxy for water access, distance calculations show that 29% of shallow wells with >50 mu g/L As are located within walking distance (100 m) of at least one of the 915 intermediate or deep wells. Similar calculations for a hypothetical more even distribution of deep wells show that 74% of shallow wells with >50 mu g/L As could have been located within 100 m of the same number of deep wells. These observations and well-usage data suggest that community wells in Araihazar, and probably elsewhere in Bangladesh, were not optimally allocated by the government because of elite capture.",
2745,"Occurrence, distribution and health risk assessment of organophosphate esters in outdoor dust in Nanjing, China: Urban vs. rural areas With increasing use of organophosphate esters (OPEs) largely due to the phasing out of various brominated flame retardants, much more attention has been paid to their occurrence, distribution and potential health risks. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and distribution characteristics associated to their potential health risks of selected 13 OPEs in outdoor dust with a comparison between urban and rural areas in Nanjing, China as well as seasonal variations. Ten out of 13 OPEs showed higher concentrations in urban dust than those in rural dust (p < 0.05). Six OPEs congeners exhibited significantly different concentrations with seasonal variations (p < 0.01) in rural dust. Halogenated OPEs were the dominant group in both urban (median: 56.8%) and rural (median: 45.9%) dust, and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP) was found to be the most abundant OPE in both urban (median: 48.7%) and rural (median:26.4%) dust. Principal component analysis with multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) and spearman correlations showed the different sources of OPEs in urban and rural dust. The non-carcinogenic (Hazard Index, HI < 1.62 x 10(-5)) and carcinogenic risks (CR< 2.28 x 10(-5)) of EOPEs were much lower than the theoretical threshold of risk, revealing a negligible risk to local residents from the exposure of OPEs in outdoor dust.

2746,"Hydrogeochemical and isotopic studies of groundwater in the middle voltaian aquifers of the Gushegu district of the Northern region This work is to establish the hydrochemistry and origin of groundwater in some parts of the Gushegu district of the Northern Region of Ghana. Hydrochemical data from 19 groundwater and 7 rock samples have been used to evaluate water quality, water types, and sources of various ions as well as origin of the groundwater. The study results show that the quality of groundwater from the area is generally not good due to their fluoride (F-), bicarbonate (HCO3-) and electrical conductivity (EC) concentrations. The F- contents of the groundwater have values as high as 1.97 mg/ L, with 53 % of the groundwater having concentrations of F- exceeding the WHO recommended allowable limits. These high F- values have the potential of causing serious health problems such as kidney failure, dental and skeletal fluorosis, reproductive problem and reduction in intelligent quotient of consumers. A plot of Gibbs diagram reveals that rock weathering and precipitation are the major hydrogeochemical processes regulating the water chemistry of the study area. Petrographic thin-section analyses of rock samples identify minerals present to be muscovite, plagioclase feldspars, quartz, sericite and iron oxide. Stable isotope (O-18 and H-2) composition of the waters reveals that most of the groundwater is likely to be recharged from local precipitation, indicating their meteoric origin. Some samples, however, showed considerable evaporation.",
2747,"Determinants and Consequences of Arsenic Metabolism Efficiency among 4,794 Individuals: Demographics, Lifestyle, Genetics, and Toxicity Background: Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs), a class I carcinogen, affects several hundred million people worldwide. Once absorbed, iAs is converted to monomethylated (MMA) and then dimethylated forms (DMA), with methylation facilitating urinary excretion. The abundance of each species in urine relative to their sum (iAs%, MMA%, and DMA%) varies across individuals, reflecting differences in arsenic metabolism capacity. Methods: The association of arsenic metabolism phenotypes with participant characteristics and arsenical skin lesions was characterized among 4,794 participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (Araihazar, Bangladesh). Metabolism phenotypes include those obtained from principal component (PC) analysis of arsenic species. Results: Two independent PCs were identified: PC1 appears to represent capacity to produce DMA (second methylation step), and PC2 appears to represent capacity to convert iAs to MMA (first methylation step). PC1 was positively associated (P < 0.05) with age, female sex, and BMI, while negatively associated with smoking, arsenic exposure, education, and land ownership. PC2 was positively associated with age and education but negatively associated with female sex and BMI. PC2 was positively associated with skin lesion status, while PC1 was not. 10q24.32/AS3MT region polymorphisms were strongly associated with PC1, but not PC2. Patterns of association for most variables were similar for PC1 and DMA%, and for PC2 and MMA% with the exception of arsenic exposure and SNP associations. Conclusions: Two distinct arsenic metabolism phenotypes show unique associations with age, sex, BMI, 10q24.32 polymorphisms, and skin lesions. Impact: This work enhances our understanding of arsenic metabolism kinetics and toxicity risk profiles. (C) 2015 AACR.",
2748,"High temperatures and human pressures interact to influence mortality in an African carnivore The impacts of high ambient temperatures on mortality in humans and domestic animals are well-understood. However much less is known about how hot weather affects mortality in wild animals. High ambient temperatures have been associated with African wild dog Lycaon pictus pup mortality, suggesting that high temperatures might also be linked to high adult mortality.We analyzed mortality patterns in African wild dogs radio-collared in Kenya (0Â°N), Botswana (20Â°S), and Zimbabwe (20Â°S), to examine whether ambient temperature was associated with adult mortality.We found that high ambient temperatures were associated with increased adult wild dog mortality at the Kenya site, and there was some evidence for temperature associations with mortality at the Botswana and Zimbabwe sites.At the Kenya study site, which had the highest human impact, high ambient temperatures were associated with increased risks of wild dogs being killed by people, and by domestic dog diseases. In contrast, temperature was not associated with the risk of snare-related mortality at the Zimbabwe site, which had the second-highest human impact. Causes of death varied markedly between sites.Pack size was positively associated with survival at all three sites.These findings suggest that while climate change may not lead to new causes of mortality, rising temperatures may exacerbate existing anthropogenic threats to this endangered species, with implications for conservation. This evidence suggests that temperature-related mortality, including interactions between temperature and other anthropogenic threats, should be investigated in a greater number of species to understand and mitigate likely impacts of climate change. â€‹.",
2749,"Active Versus Passive Cooling Systems In Increasing Solar Panel Output Energy availability will remain an issue whole years as energy is the primary human need to live in this planet. Fossil energy is no longer the primary choice as its availability decreases every year, although it dominates the energy source used today. Solar cell is increasingly installed throughout the world even dough initial cost is still expensive for many developing and poor countries. For them who have connected the solar system generators to grid, sunlight to electrical conversion efficiency is the primary concern. On the other hand, system output optimization such as by using maximum power tracking method and cooling system are non material efficient solutions. Maximum tracking system may be costly as mechanical system should be developed well for large solar system. Cooling system on the other hand, is much simpler but limited in efficiency increment. Even dough, beside efficiency increment, the cooling system assists system to avoid excessive surface temperature, which in some cases may lead to panel destruction. The active cooling system requires some electric current from the solar panel output to enable cooling system works. The system achieves better surface temperature reduction than passive cooling system, but the current absorption should be as low as possible to avoid deficiency. This work proposed water based cooling system energized by batteries and compared the output performance to passive cooling system. The result shows that the periodic water sprinkler results better temperature decrement about 13.6% higher power than passive cooling system for sprinkler period of 20 minutes and sprinkle duration of 20 second. The performance decreases when sprinkler period is set 60 minutes. By using the applied water tank, water is available up to 24 hours for sprinkle period of 20 minutes but last longer for 60 minutes. Horizontal sprinkler position results larger cooled area than vertical position which generates 2.45% higher output power. Â© 2021, Procedia Environmental Science, Engineering and Management.

2750,"Mitigation Potential of Sanitation Infrastructure on Groundwater Contamination by Nitrate in Maputo In Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, nitrate concentrations above 250 mg L-1 in groundwater have been reported. This happens due to the widespread use of latrines and septic tanks that allow for constant infiltration of its content into the soil and eventually to groundwater sources, a situation that is widespread in the Global South and represents a serious threat for human health and for the environment. This is a reflection of limited access to safe and adequate sanitation services, which the local authorities have set to improve in the forthcoming decades with a recently commissioned city-wide sanitation masterplan serving as a basis for the works. In this article, we aimed at understanding whether the infrastructure projected in the masterplan would lead to a reduction of nitrogen reaching groundwater. Currently, according to our calculations, almost 500 onnes of nitrogen reach the city's groundwater sources each year, with the masterplan potentially resulting in a 14% reduction, a small reduction due to its reliance on maintaining and expanding fecal sludge services, without considering investments to improve domestic systems (e.g., construction of contained systems). An alternative, not presented in the Masterplan and put forward by the authors, could be the construction of simplified sewers in two of the city's most densely populated neighborhoods, with a potential 29% reduction in nitrogen reaching groundwater.",
2751,"Stratification of tidal influenced navigation channel Field observation was performed to understand the mixing and stratifying processes in an estuarine navigation channel. An artificial gate located at the mouth of Geum River in Korea discharges freshwater to the coastal sea. While the stratification in this channel is artificially controlled by gate operation, the mixing is determined by tide with about 6 m amplitude of semidiurnal constituent. Discharged freshwater mostly flows though the southern navigation channel and leads to the strong stratification, which could be due to the strong advection in the upper layer during the ebb. At the interface between buoyant current and bottom saltier water, the features of internal waves were observed also with the reduced gravity of 15-22 kg/m(3). The gradient Richardson numbers show the seasonal variations of the stratification as expected. Relatively water column was pretty stably stratified in March and partially or well mixed in April and August throughout the regions of navigation channel.",
2752,"Research on the water use efficiency and foliar nutrient status of Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima in the extreme arid region of China Seasonal variations in foliar stable carbon composition (delta C-13) and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentrations of Populus euphratica Olivier and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb, as well as correlations between foliar delta C-13 values and N, P and K concentrations were studied in the Ejina oasis in the lower reaches of the Heihe River, northwestern China. Foliar delta C-13 values, and P and K concentrations significantly differed between species. Foliar delta C-13 signatures in T. ramosissima were significantly more enriched than those in P. euphratica, but P and K concentrations of P. euphratica were higher. The seasonal variations and patterns of these were similar. The total foliar delta C-13 values and N, P and K concentrations in both P. euphratica and T. ramosissima showed a descending trend. There were significantly positive correlations between foliar delta C-13 values and N and P concentration of both P. euphratica and T. ramosissima. For the relationship between foliar delta C-13 and K concentration, there appeared oppositely positive and negative correlations in P. euphratica and T. ramosissima, respectively, but they were not significant. The simple positive correlations of delta C-13-P% and delta C-13-N% suggested that N and P in P. euphratica and T. ramosissima behave in a similar manner. This study also showed that there were nutrient deficiencies; N and P nutriments were the co-limiting factors in P. euphratica, while it was P nutriment in T. ramosissima.",
2753,"Zika virus: raising awareness to prevent a pandemic Zika virus is a flavivirus which is transmitted through Aedes female mosquito species or sexually. ""Mild dengue"" like symptoms are noticed which usually subside shortly and uneventfully. In 1969 ZIKV was isolated in West Malaysia for the first time. Since then no case has been reported in Malaysia. WHO has declared a global threat of an epidemic spread after the outbreak in Brazil. Rain forest climate regions are at a constant state of emergency as pools of water are abundantly formed as a result of rain showers throughout the year which provides a habitat for mosquitos. We try to raise awareness and alert health governing bodies and institutions to take necessary steps to prevent and eradicate the potential pandemic threat. Counselling of females who are planning to conceive is required to minimize the threat to newborn babies. Travellers visiting the equatorial regions should be screened and counselled to detect and prevent viral infection transfer and to avoid complications on a larger scale. Zika virus (ZIKV), a form of flavivirus, is commonly thought to be transmitted through Aedes female mosquito species. Sexual transmission has also been documented. Symptoms of the viral infection are similar to those of dengue infection. Common symptoms are maculopapular rashes, arthralgia and abnormal lymphocytic activity. Symptomatic treatment and rest usually leads to a full recovery. However recently, congenital microcephaly has been ambiguously linked to infections during pregnancy. During 1969, ZIKV was isolated in West-Malaysia(1). Since then, no case in Malaysia has been documented as being affected directly or congenitally by ZIKV. In mid-2015, an epidemic outbreak originating from Brazil has been documented(2). Coincidentally, outbreaks in Cambodia, Indonesia, French Polynesia, Malaysia and Philippines have also been reported(3). Equatorial regions are at a constant risk of widespread infection attributing mainly to the rain forest climate. Malaysia has rain forest climate throughout the year. Increased risk of human-mosquito-human has been previously documented. As it is a cultural melting pot of Asian continent and one of the favourite travelling destinations, peaks of tourism are noted in mid-year. World Health Organization has declared a state of emergency to control this epidemic from spreading across the globe. We request global health organizations such as UNICEF, WHO, etc. to join hands with Governments, Social Media, local NGOs, advertising agencies, and Health professionals to battle against the upcoming potential viral Pandemic. Serological testing and Polymerase Chain Reaction methods have been used for diagnosis of infection in early stages(4). Affected cases should be reported and studied to assess the risks of further spread. Females who plan to conceive or are pregnant should be closely monitored and counselled to avoid congenital transmission. Congenitally affected children should be assessed and provided necessary mental and health care facilities. The formulation of a vaccination is way down the lane and currently we should focus all efforts for preventing the spread of infection through minimizing the risk of exposure and controlling any further transmission of cases that have already been detected. Within this context, the global model based on season as presented by Bogoch and colleagues(2), predicts higher risks of local transmission of infection in equatorial regions throughout the year as well as travelers can worsen the global situation out of proportions. The potentiality of rapid spread of ZIKV requires an urgent notice and necessary preventive measures, viz., mosquito nets, repellent sprays, proper water sanitation, eradication of water pools, fumigation etc.",
2754,"Paleoenvironmental conditions, organic matter accumulation, and unconventional hydrocarbon potential for the Permian Lucaogou Formation organic-rich rocks in Santanghu Basin, NW China Organic-rich rocks have received increasing attention for they are essential for evaluating hydrocarbon potential and unravelling the interaction between Earth surface environments and the biosphere. In this paper, we performed a combination of mineralogical, inorganic and organic geochemical analyses on a 200-m core of the Permian Lucaogou Formation organic-rich rocks obtained from Santanghu Basin, NW China, to investigate paleoenvironmental conditions, organic matter accumulation, and hydrocarbon potential. The redox- and salinity-sensitive proxies (e.g. V/Cr, V/(V + Ni) and Sr/Ba, Rb/K, B/Ga, and B content), together with the wide distribution of pyrite and carbonate minerals in these dark, thinly laminated organic-rich rocks, suggest that dysoxic-anoxic, brackish-saline, alkaline conditions prevailed during the deposition of the Lucaogou Formation in the Santanghu Basin. The occurrence of hydrothermal minerals, including strontianite and barite, and enrichments of B (up to 158.0 ppm), Mn (up to 1291 ppm), and certain incompatible elements (Li (up to 923 ppm), Rb (up to 848 ppm), Sr (up to 1760 ppm), Hf (up to 12.7 ppm)) as well as Ni vs. Co vs. Zn and Fe vs. Mn vs. (Cu + Co + Ni) x 10 ternary diagrams demonstrate that the Lucaogou Formation received hydrothermal input during deposition, which suggests hydrothermalism was the source of brine that has caused the salinization of the water column. The positive correlation of HI value and TOC content, together with redox-sensitive proxies, illustrates primary productivity in surface water and preservation in anoxic bottom water collectively contributed to the enrichment of organic matter. Moreover, the positive correlation between silicate mineral content and TOC content and the negative correlation between carbonate content and TOC content suggest that terrigenous input as the main source of nutrients promoted organic matter accumulation, while carbonate constituents acted as a diluent to organic matter accumulation during deposition of the Lucaogou Formation. The faint positive correlation between TOC content and hydrothermal intensity indicator (Cr/Zr) seems to indicate that hydrothermal fluids may provide an additional source of nutrients for organic matter accumulation. In addition, the oil generation capacity of Lucaogou Formation, with abundant oil-prone organic matter (Type I/II1 kerogen with HI values ranging from 421.18-918.41 mg HC/g TOC) in the early mature to mature stage (T-max values ranging from 435 to 451 degrees C), is considerable. The Rock-Eval oil saturation index (OSI=S-1/TOC x 100) values range from 6.04-164.07 mg HC/g TOC, suggesting the Lucaogou Formation contains producible oil. The high brittle mineral (including quartz and carbonates) contents ( > 50% wt%) and traces of clay minerals ( < 5 wt%) imply that the Lucaogou Formation is likely to respond well to hydraulic stimulation. Consequently, the Lucaogou Formation in Santanghu Basin is expected to be a potential lacustrine shale oil play.",

2756,"Seasonal effects on contamination characteristics of tap water from rural Beijing: A multiple isotope approach Excessive exploitation of the groundwater and discharge of urban and industrial wastewater into the environment led to a significant decline of the local surface and groundwater quality in many parts of the Beijing urban area. In the present study, tap water derived from deep groundwater (> 70 m depth) was collected in two seasons in the rural area around urban Beijing, China, in order to shed light on the hydrochemical composition of the local drinking water. For these, cation (Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+) and anion (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, F-) concentrations were measured. In addition, multiple stable isotope (delta(15) N-nitrate, delta O-18(nitrate), delta S-34(sulfate), delta O-18(sulfate), Delta S-33(sulfate)) analyses were applied for identifying the specific hydrochemical processes and major contamination sources. The result showed that thirty percent of the analyzed tap water in the wet season and twenty-three percent in the dry season do not comply with the national legislation and represent a serious health risk, primarily due to high nitrate concentrations. Moreover, half of tap water could not be drunk due to the pollution of ammonium in wet season. Thereby, the most deteriorated tap water was derived from the highest populated areas in rural Beijing. Multiple isotopes reveal urban sewage as the dominant pollution source for deep groundwater as the principle tap water source. Therefore, it is necessary to control public and private sewage disposal and exchange leaking sewer pipes in order to reduce the risk of anthropogenic contamination of groundwater, representing the prime drinking water source in the Beijing area. This study demonstrates clearly the advantage of multi-isotope approach for evaluating water quality problems in urban groundwater.",
2757,"Estimating soil ammonium adsorption using pedotransfer functions in an irrigation district of the North China Plain Extensive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture can induce high concentration of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) in soil. Desorption and leaching of NH4+-N has led to pollution of natural waters. The adsorption of in soil plays an important role in the fate of the NH4+-N. Understanding the adsorption characteristics of is necessary to ascertain and predict its fate in the soil-water environment, and pedotransfer functions (PTFs) could be a convenient method for quantification of the adsorption parameters. Ammonium nitrogen adsorption capacity, isotherms, and their influencing factors were investigated for various soils in an irrigation district of the North China Plain. Fourteen agricultural soils with three types of texture (silt, silty loam, and sandy loam) were collected from topsoil to perform batch experiments. Silt and silty loam soils had higher NH4+-N adsorption capacity than sandy loam soils. Clay and silt contents significantly affected the adsorption capacity of NH4+-N in the different soils. The adsorption isotherms of NH4+-N in the 14 soils fit well using the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin models. The models' adsorption parameters were significantly related to soil properties including clay, silt, and organic carbon contents and Fe2+ and Fe3+ ion concentrations in the groundwater. The PTFs that relate soil and groundwater properties to soil NH4+-N adsorption isotherms were derived using multiple regressions where the coefficients were predicted using the Bayesian method. The PTFs of the three adsorption isotherm models were successfully verified and could be useful tools to help predict NH4+-N adsorption at a regional scale in irrigation districts.",
2758,"Effects of a PLA/PBAT biodegradable film mulch as a replacement of polyethylene film and their residues on crop and soil environment Residues from the polyethylene (PE) film mulch (PM) in the south of China have caused severe soil pollution and reduction of crop yield. Biodegradable film mulch (BM) has been considered as a good alternative to PM for many crops, but its suitability for winter-planting potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and the effects of its residues after incorporation on soil and succeeding crop have not been fully investigated. We conducted a two-year (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) field experiment to compare the effects of polylactic acid (PLA)/ poly(butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT)-based BM, PM, and no film mulch (NM) on dynamics of soil temperature and water storage, water use efficiency (WUE), and potato yield, as well as the effects of their residues on rice yield and soil properties thereafter in 2020. The results showed that the soil temperature and soil water storage differed between treatments BM and PM in topsoil at later stages of potato growth due to the degradation of biodegradable film initiated at 60 days after sowing. However, there were no significant differences between treatments BM and PM on potato tuber yield and WUE across two cropping seasons. After harvest of rice, the residual biodegradable films (RBF) were reduced to an extremely low level, and did not cause yield loss of rice statistically as compared to the no residual film (NRF) treatment. In addition, RBFs could improve soil health regarding bulk density, porosity and organic matter as compared to the residual PE film (RPF) treatment. Therefore, we are confident that the PLA/PBAT biodegradable film is a promising and sustainable option to replace PM in winter-planting potato production.",
2759,"Microbial involvement in the dynamics of arsenic in irrigated agricultural systems of Bangladesh This research was conducted to investigate the effect of soil microorganisms on the mobilization of arsenic (As) in irrigated agricultural soils, particularly in the rhizosphere. The study area was a hot spot for As in groundwater which is used to irrigate the agricultural lands. Soils were incubated under various imposed treatments and changes in As-concentrations as well as iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) were observed. The results of this experiment support theories that presence of arsenic-utilizing microorganisms may have a significant role in enhancing arsenic mobility in agricultural lands contaminated by arsenic through irrigation.",
2760,"Interflow in semiarid environments: An overlooked process in risk assessment Risk assessment, both human and ecological, embodies fundamental assumptions about hydrological processes, especially how they affect the movement of contaminants in the environment. The lateral movement of water through the soil, or interflow, is frequently a component of risk assessments for humid environments, but not of those for semiarid environments. Our research has shown that, contrary to what was previously thought, interflow can be important in semiarid landscapes and is, therefore, an essential consideration for risk assessment in these regions. To illustrate and assess the effect of interflow on estimates of risk, we (1) developed a simple conceptual model to describe the role that interflow may have in the redistribution of surface and near-surface contamination, and (2) used RESRAD, an exposure model for assessing radionuclide doses to humans, to evaluate the effectiveness of landfill covers in mitigating doses of three contaminants (H-3, U-238, and Pu-239/240) at a site in northern New Mexico at which interflow is known to be occurring. Only those calculations of the model that took interflow into account yielded the result that the radionuclides would contaminate groundwater - underscoring the potential importance of interflow as a mechanism for the transport of contaminants. We conclude that failure to take interflow into account can render risk assessments inaccurate and remediation ineffective. Further, our work demonstrates that a general understanding of hydrological processes is essential for accurate risk assessment, ecological as well as human.",
2761,"Application of temporal GIS to track areas of significant concern regarding groundwater contamination This study is intended to explain discrimination of permanent and temporary groundwater quality zones using temporal geographic information system. The test area for this work is Lahore, Pakistan, where both quality and quantity of underground aquifer are under pressure due to anthropogenic activities. The analysis has been performed after developing precise interpolated surfaces, and verified through cross-validation, for the quality parameters of pH, TDS, Ca, Mg, Cl and HCO3. All the parameters have been studied from the year 2010-2013 for their individual as well as combined geographic distribution in the form of water quality index (WQI). Time series maps of individual parameters with same spatial scale have led the analysis to the extreme behavior of pH and Mg in the year 2011 and concentration of TDS crossing WHO limits in year 2010 (1323 mg/L), etc. Spatio-temporal analysis of WQI figured out temporary as well as permanent epicenters of groundwater pollution, the one around Anarkali region is not only permanent but also expanding gradually. On the basis of WQI scores, five categories have been introduced; WQI < 70 is ""good,'' 70 < WQI < 84 is ""moderately good,'' 84 < WQI < 97 is ""marginally good,'' 97 < WQI < 110 is ""moderate,'' and WQI > 110 is ""poor.'' It is found that categories attributed to ""good'' and ""moderately good'' are spatially transforming to ""moderate'' and ""poor.'' The results are endorsed by WQI for the year 2014, exhibiting the same contamination plume with an expansion rate even higher than the previous years. This study can be useful to channelize the limited resources of developing countries for preservation of existing aquifer.",
2762,"Water supply safety of riverbank filtration wells under the impact of surface water-groundwater interaction: Evidence from long-term field pumping tests Water supply safety of riverbank filtration wells (RBFWs) have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years as their role in water supply is increasingly valued. In this study, this issue was revealed from the perspective of water level, quality and supply capacity of RBFWs based on an interference-pumping test with three pumping wells near the Songhua River in Northeast China followed by a recovery test. The results showed that a stable cone of depression of groundwater level in the riverbank filtration (RBF) formed after pumping for about five days with the maximum drawdown of the groundwater level of 10.42 m. The corresponding water capacity of the well group maintained 2.78 x 10(4) m(3)/cl from then until the end of the test, 60% of which were captured directly from the river. The groundwater level could return to the level before the pumping test after the pumping test stopped for one day. The RBF could provide turbidity, trace organic substances and major cations and anions (except for Ca2+ and Mg2+) pre-treatment of the river water with the removal rates of 29%-95% for some water quality indicators. However, limited improvement of water quality was observed with respect to some inorganic contaminants (Fe, Mn and NH4+-N) because the background concentrations of them in the groundwater were higher than in the river water. When compared with the impact on water level and supply capacity, the impact of the surface water-groundwater interaction on the mechanisms of water quality evolution was more complicated. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that RBFWs can ensure a sustainable water supply of stable quality, which can also simplify the post-treatment processes of waterworks and reduce costs.

2763,"Studying of antifungal activity of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes by microwave-assisted technique In this paper, we reinforced the antifungal activity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using an effective technique. Covalent functionalization of MWCNTs was performed by lysine and arginine under microwave radiation. To prove functionalization phenomenon, the grafted chemical groups on the surfaces of MWCNTs were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Antifungal activities of functionalized MWCNTs as well as pristine MWCNTs were tested against different fungal species based on minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and radial diffusion assay. MIC results showed that the antifungal activity of MWCNTs-lysine, in comparison to pristine MWCNTs against fungi, including Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candidate albicans, Penicillium chrysogenum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Fusarium culmorum, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum and Penicillium lilacinum were increased 1.92, 2.36, 2.35, 1.3, 1.5, 1.1, 2.54, 1.23, 1.42 and 2.1 times, respectively. Similarly, the antifungal activity of MWCNTs-arginine was increased 1.98, 2.40, 2.55, 1.8, 1.9, 1.7, 2.64, 1.36, 2.1 and 2.55 times, respectively. On the basis of the results of this study, it is clearly indicated that covalent groups of lysine and arginine could improve the antifungal activity of MWCNTs.

2764,"Environmental Implications of Animal Wastes Pollution on Agricultural Soil and Water Quality An attempt was made to ascertain the environmental effects of animal wastes pollution on agricultural soil and water quality at the oldest teaching and research farm, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria. Physical, chemical, and bacteriological analyses of water (shallow well) and soil samples were carried out to determine the present quality status. Fifteen soil samples collected at the centre of the animal wastes dump and at a distance of 5 and 10 m, and three different samplings done on the water source were analyzed. The parameters determined using APHA standard procedures included: turbidity, temperature, pH, alkalinity, sulphide, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, total hardness, biochemical oxygen demand, total iron, nitrate, chloride, calcium, and heavy metals like copper, zinc, and lead. Most of the parameters indicated pollution including heavy metals presence with the exception of Pb, Zn, Mn, Cu, and Cr that were not detected in water samples. Concentrations of nitrate, biochemical oxygen demand, SO42-, PO43-, and were 0.20, 3.20, 10.50, 3.5, and 20.4 mg/l respectively, while those of detected heavy metals such as Mg and Ni were 1.98 and 10.03 mg/l, respectively. Soil water holding capacity, porosity, pH, organic matter, organic carbon, and organic nitrogen ranged from 33.34 +/- 3.73 to 59.06 +/- 5.69, 34.6 +/- 3.28 to 52.43 +/- 5.5, 6.56 +/- 0.03 to 7.54 +/- 0.03, 2.32 +/- 0.03 to 5.35 +/- 0.03, 1.33 +/- 0.01 to 3.11 +/- 0.01, and 0.58 +/- 0.07 to 1.13 +/- 0.03%, respectively. The results showed that the well is strongly polluted with bacteria and pathogens and requires considerable treatment before use while the soil is suitable for crop production.",
2765,"A multi-criteria water quality evaluation for human consumption, irrigation and industrial purposes in Umunya area, southeastern Nigeria In developing regions that engage in agricultural and industrial activities, access to high-quality water for drinking, domestic, irrigation and industrial purposes is limited. In this study, comprehensive water quality assessment has been carried out to unravel the suitability of water supplies in Umunya suburb for human consumption, industrial and irrigation purposes. Water samples from spring, streams, and boreholes were analysed for physicochemical properties and heavy metals pollution. Pollution index of groundwater (PIG) was used to assess the drinking suitability of the waters whereas several indexical methods were integrated to unravel their suitability for irrigation and industrial purposes. The pH (4.61-6.53) revealed that majority of the samples are acidic. All the chemical ions were within their respective standard allowable limits, except for Fe, Pb and Ni. Generally, these heavy metals significantly impacted the water quality of the area. The PIG evaluation of the waters for drinking purpose revealed that 40% of the samples are unsuitable. However, most of the indices used for the irrigation water quality evaluation showed that majority of the samples are suitable for irrigation uses. The industrial water quality assessment indicated that the natural waters have more corrosive tendency than scaling tendency. Corrosivity and scaling indices, such as Langelier index, Larson-Skold index, chloride-sulphate mass ratio, aggressive index, Ryznar stability index, and Puckorius scaling index, unveiled that the natural waters are severely corrosive, having the tendency to damage domestic, irrigational, and industrial water distribution systems. This paper provides significant information necessary for the management and sustainability of water resources in Umunya suburb.",
2766,"Household's willingness to pay for arsenic safe drinking water in Bangladesh This study examines willingness to pay (WTP) in Bangladesh for arsenic (As) safe drinking water across different As-risk zones, applying a double bound discrete choice value elicitation approach. The study aims to provide a robust estimate of the benefits of As safe drinking water supply, which is compared to the results from a similar study published almost 10 years ago using a single bound estimation procedure. Tests show that the double bound valuation design does not suffer from anchoring or incentive incompatibility effects. Health risk awareness levels are high and households are willing to pay on average about 5 percent of their disposable average annual household income for As safe drinking water. Important factors influencing WTP include the bid amount to construct communal deep tubewell for As safe water supply, the risk zone where respondents live, household income, water consumption, awareness of water source contamination, whether household members are affected by As contamination, and whether they already take mitigation measures.",
2767,"[Effect of terracing project on temporal-spatial variation of non-point source pollution load in Hujiashan watershed, China] Taking Hujiashan small watershed as the study area, based on the classified result of Landsat TM/ETM images of 2005, 2010 and 2015, combined with long-term field observation data, and used the export coefficient model, our study explored the effect of small watershed management project on temporal and spatial variation of total nitrogen (TN) load of non-point source pollution under the support of GIS technology. The results indicated that, due to the implementation of slope modification project, the area of cultivated land was significantly increased, while forest and bareland were decreased. The load of non-point source TN increased from 63208 kg in 2005 to 72778 kg in 2010, but reduced to 46876 kg in 2015. The contribution rate from residential areas was higher, the average contribution rate of the three periods was 53.5%, but it showed a decreasing trend year by year. The contribution rate of land use types was 45%, which showed an increasing trend year by year. The contribution rate of livestock was always low. From the spatial distribution, TN loading intensity was changed obviously after the terracing project. High load intensity zone was mainly concentrated on the slope of 5Â°-15Â° before terracing project. Nevertheless, high load intensity zone was concentrated on the slope of 15Â°-35Â° after terracing project, and 5Â°-8Â° had become a low load strength area. The TN load intensity changed little with time on the slope of 0Â°-8Â°, and it increased first and then decreased on the slope above 8Â°. With the treatment of sewage, garbage and livestock manure in rural areas, the output of nitrogen in the living and livestock breeding were significantly reduced. Due to the implementation of the project, the cultivated land area increased by 31%.",
2768,"Mechanisms of element precipitation in carbonatite-related rare-earth element deposits: Evidence from fluid inclusions in the Maoniuping deposit, Sichuan Province, southwestern China Carbonatite-related rare-earth element (REE) deposits (CARDs) are the major global source of REEs. The ore forming fluids of CARDs usually comprise multiple components and record complicated evolutions. The Maoniuping REE deposit, located in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, is the second-largest CARD in China and contains total reserves of 3.17 Mt of light rare-earth oxides (REOs). Geochronological and geological data show that the deposit was formed at similar to 25 Ma and was only moderately affected by tectonic and hydrothermal activities, thereby allowing us to study the evolution of ore fluids as well as the mechanisms of REE mineralization. The Maoniuping REE deposit is spatially associated with a carbonatite-syenite complex and includes two sections: Guangtoushan and Dagudao. The Dagudao section is the main focus of exploration and hosts well-developed vein systems. In the uppermost vein system, minerals are zoned from the syenite wall-rock contact to the vein centers in the order of biotite, aegirine-augite, arfvedsonite, calcite, quartz, barite, fluorite, and bastnasite(Ce). Based on geological observations and the petrography of fluid inclusions, the mineralization processes are classified into magmatic, pegmatitic, hydrothermal I, hydrothermal II, and REE stages. The inclusions in these stages include melt (M), melt-fluid (M-L), pure CO2 (C), aqueous-CO2 (L-C), aqueous-CO2 with crystals (L - C + S), liquid-vapor aqueous with crystals (L - V + S), and liquid-vapor (L-V) type inclusions. The magmatic stage is marked by a carbonatite-syenite complex with minor bastnasite-(Ce), whereas the pegmatitic stage consists of coarse-grained calcite, barite, fluorite, and quartz that contain M, M-L, and L-C type inclusions with a fluid system of NaCl-Na2SO4-H2O-CO2 at high temperature ( > 600 degrees C) and high salinity ( > 45 wt% NaCl equiv.). The hydrothermal I stage is characterized by fenitization and is marked by aegirine-augite and arfvedsonite containing abundant L-V and few 1,-C type inclusions. This stage is characterized by high temperatures (similar to 480 degrees C) and moderate salinity (10.2-17.9 wt% NaCI equiv.), with a fluid system of NaCl-Na2SO4-H2O and minor CO2 and CH4 + C2H6. The hydrothermal II stage is dominated by L-C, L- C + S, L- V + S, and L-V type inclusions that are hosted in barite, calcite, fluorite, and quartz, and formed at moderate to high temperatures (260-350 degrees C), with a wide range of salinity (9.4-47.8 wt% NaCI equiv.), a fluid system of NaCl-Na2SO4-CO2-H2O, and abundant CH4 + C2H6. During the REE stage, pervasive bastnasite-(Ce) containing abundant L-V type and few L-C type inclusions crystallized under low temperatures (160-240 degrees C) and low salinities (8.8-13.1 wt% NaCI equiv.) with a fluid system of NaCl-H2O and minor CO2 and CH4 + C2H6. The results of ion-chromatographic analysis show that the ore fluids are rich in Na+, K+, Cl-, F-, and (SO4)2-, and have low Cl- /(SO4)(2)(-) ratios (0.78-2.00), showing a marked contrast with the fluids of granite related REE deposits (Cl- /(SO4)(2)(-) > 50) and a similarity to subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The SD and 8180fluid values and the high N-2/Ar ratios indicate that the ore fluids originated from carbonatitic magma and were dominated by magmatic water during the hydrothermal I stage, whereas magmatic and meteoric water co-existed during the hydrothermal II and REE stages. Moreover, the higher ratios of CO2/N-2 (9-64) and CO2/ CH4 (17-472) and the higher concentrations of CO2, CH4, C2H6, and N-2 in the hydrothermal II stage compared with the hydrothermal I stage are attributed to intense immiscibility that resulted from decompression and is constrained to temperatures of 310-350 C and pressures of 2.0-2.4 kbar. In contrast, microthermometric data and low CH4, C2H6, and N-2 contents for the REE stage show that fluid cooling and mixing with meteoric water played an important role during the intensive mineralization of this stage, which occurred under shallow open system conditions at temperatures of 200 C and pressu es of < 0.5 kbar. The mineral assemblages, together with experimental petrology results, suggest that the REE transport capability of the hydrothermal fluids was due to the high contents of (SO4)(2-), Cl- and F- complexes. In addition, CO2 that separates during immiscibility is known to act as a buffer that constrains the pH of ore fluids. Thus, immiscibility during the hydrothermal II stage could have provided favorable conditions for the migration of REEs. The subsequent cooling of fluids, the involvement of meteoric water, and increased fluid pH, favored the precipitation of REEs in the Maoniuping deposit.",
2769,"Soil morphology related to hydrology and degradation in tropical coastal podzols (SE Brazil) Morphology of podzol profiles can be used to improve our understanding of soil formation and degradation processes. The morphology of a podzol chronosequence was studied for a 1800 m long cliff perpendicular to the coastline at the southern coast of the Island liha Comprida (Sao Paulo, Brazil). The large variation in hydrological conditions with time (surfaces with ages from 6000 to 300 yrs BP) and space (topography) allowed studying the relation between podzol morphology and drainage conditions, both during soil formation and degradation. On the oldest two surfaces, the podzols formed under poorly drained circumstances. Uplift during their formation resulted in (1) very deep Bh horizons and (2) degradation of the upper B horizon as a result of improved drainage. On the younger surface most podzols were poorly drained, but well-drained podzols and transitions occurred in beach ridges. In the cliffs on the southern coast of the island, improved drainage of the poorly drained podzols resulted in degradation of the B horizon. This degradation exhibits various forms, including (1) complete removal of the B horizon down to an underlying clay layer, (2) degradation of the B horizon along root channels with preferential vertical water transport, (3) degradation of the upper B horizon resulting in a diffuse EB transition, and (4) areas of organic matter (OM) depletion related to microbial activity, sometimes combined with burrowing. Type (2) degradation may result in a convoluted EB transition, the formation of islands of B horizon in the deepening E horizon, and formation of E horizon tongues into the Bh. Recent (post degradation) OM bands were found in E and B horizons. A thorough study of podzol morphology can be used to reconstruct several stages of their formation and degradation in relation to drainage conditions.",
2770,"Composition of chemical elements in the edible viscera of Tibetan pigs and its correlation with environment and feed The main purpose of this research was to evaluate the element distribution in the edible viscera of Tibetan pigs and to clarify its correlation with soils, drinking water and feed. A total of 55 chemical elements were simultaneously quantified. P, K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe and Zn were the most abundant elements in the analyzed viscera. The general distribution of all element concentrations in the viscera of Tibetan pigs was such that liverÂ >Â kidneyÂ >Â small intestineÂ >Â heartÂ =Â lungÂ =Â large intestineÂ >Â stomach. Comparison with national and international allowable limits of toxic elements indicates that consumption of Tibetan pig viscera presents potential health risks. Spearman correlation analysis reveals that significantly (pÂ <Â 0.0001) positive relationships exist between the element profiles of viscera and drinking water, soils as well as feed. For all edible viscera, the largest values of correlation coefficient were observed to be with corn feed. Our research provides a relatively comprehensive investigation of the elemental composition in Tibetan pig viscera. The correlation data would be helpful for the local farm to reformulate the feed for Tibetan pigs to improve the quality and safety of the viscera.",
2771,"COLLABORATION IN INDIAN PHYSICS - A CASE-STUDY OF THE MACRO AND MICRO PARAMETRIZATION OF SUB-DISCIPLINES (1800-1950) The decade beginning 1920 is an important watershed in the history of physics in modern India. This is evident from the bibliometric data available on the publications in physics between 1800 and 1950. The paper studies the evolution of collaboration in four subdisciplines of physics during this period. In order to do so, two sets of measures of research collaboration have been employed. The collaboration index and collaboration coefficient have been calculated for the sub-disciplines. As far as the micro-parametrization of the discipline is concerned, collaboration measures developed by Egghe are obtained for the research careers of four leading Indian physicists, who were responsible for the institutionalization of physics research in India. In the present case the role of individuals responsible for the institutionalization of physics research is seen to be germane to the explosion of the number of publications in the 1920s. At the conjucture of the history of science and scientometrics, it is evident how the former can endow the latter with a modality of explanation; further, it is evident how scientometrics can inform the efforts of historians of science.",
2772,"Margin segmentation prior to continental break-up: A seismic-stratigraphic record of multiphased rifting in the North Atlantic (Southwest Iberia) A dense grid of multichannel (2D) seismic profiles, tied to borehole, dredge and outcrop data are used to analyze the multiphased rifting, structural architecture and rift-locus migration across the southwest Iberian margin. In the study area, three distinct sectors show different structural evolutions from the Late Triassic to the Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous. The three structural sectors are distinguished by: 1) the presence of incipient tilt-blocks on the inner proximal margin, which denotes limited syn-rift subsidence; 2) developed tilt-blocks on the outer proximal margin; 3) evidence of significant fault-related subsidence on the outer proximal margin during the Middle Jurassic, followed by an Oxfordian-Tithonian/Berriasian(?) rift phase leading to seafloor spreading; and 4) marked crustal stretching on the distal margin, where highly-rotated tilt-blocks overlain by thick Late Triassic to Late Jurassic units are observed. This work demonstrates that significant subsidence occurred in Southwest Iberia several millions of years prior to the latest Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous extensional episode leading to continental breakup. The magnitude of early-subsidence episodes approaches that of the last subsidence pulse preceding continental breakup. Across the southwest Iberian margin the observed structural sectors differ from each other in terms of the age of rift climax of syn-rift strata. We interpret the multiple extensional pulses recorded in Southwest Iberia as resulting not only from continental rifting between Iberia and Newfoundland, but also between Nova Scotia and Morocco. Thus, it is considered that pre-breakup units in the deep-offshore basins of Iberia comprise multiple rift-related sequences whose distribution and relative thickness depends on local subsidence rates, on the diachronous northward-migration of rifting, and on the relative crustal stretching experienced by individual sub-basins.

2773,"Altered profile of urinary arsenic metabolites in adults with chronic arsenicism. A pilot study Relationships between alterations in the profile of urinary arsenic (As) species and the presence of cutaneous signs of arsenicism were studied in Region Lagunera, Mexico. The use of urinary concentrations of putative substrates and products of the As metabolism pathway, as indicators of metabolic efficiency is also discussed. Arsenic was determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry and separation of As species was performed by ion exchange chromatography. The exposed group had an average of 0.408 mg As/l of total As (TAs) in their drinking water, whereas ""control' individuals had 0.031 mg/l. Urinary concentrations of arsenic species and TAs were 20 to 95 times higher in the exposed group. Significant increases in the relative proportions of inorganic arsenic (Asi) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), accompanied by decreases of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were also found in exposed individuals. Therefore, significant decreases in the value of the MMA/Asi, DMA/MMA and DMA/ Asi ratios were observed, suggesting a decreased As methylating ability. Exposed individuals bearing cutaneous signs had a significantly longer time of exposure, higher urinary concentrations and proportions of MMA and MMA/Asi values, and significantly lower DMA/ MMA than exposed individuals without cutaneous signs. Further research is needed to identify better parameters for assessing the efficiency of As metabolism in chronically exposed populations and to confirm the potential relationship between metabolic alterations and overt signs of As toxicity.",
2774,"Scaling Effects of Elevation Data on Urban Nonpoint Source Pollution Simulations The scale effects of digital elevation models (DEM) on hydrology and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution simulations have been widely reported for natural watersheds but seldom studied for urban catchments. In this study, the scale effect of DEM data on the rainfall-runoff and NPS pollution was studied in a typical urban catchment in China. Models were constructed based on the DEM data of nine different resolutions. The conventional model performance indicators and the information entropy method were applied together to evaluate the scale effects. Based on the results, scaling effects and a resolution threshold of DEM data exist for urban NPS pollution simulations. Compared with natural watersheds, the urban NPS pollution simulations were primarily affected by the local terrain due to the overall flat terrain and dense sewer inlet distribution. The overland process simulation responded more sensitively than the catchment outlet, showing prolonged times of concentration for impervious areas with decreasing DEM resolution. The diverse spatial distributions and accumulation magnitudes of pollutants could lead to different simulation responses to scaling effects. This paper provides information about the specific characteristics of the scale effects of DEM data in a typical urban catchment, and these results can be extrapolated to other similar catchments as a reference for data collection.",
2775,"Previously unrecognized potential threat to children from manganese in groundwater in rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh The forced displacement of over 700,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar to Bangladesh since the crackdown in August 2017 has resulted in a critical humanitarian and environmental crisis. Groundwater is the primary source of drinking water in the camps that were constructed to provide shelter for the refugee population. The current study explores occurrence of Mn in groundwater in the Rohingya camps and adjacent areas. A total of 52 groundwater samples were collected between August and October 2018 from different camps sites and the adjacent host area. It was found that 64% exceeded the Bangladesh standard (100Â Î¼g/L) suggesting the presence of elevated concentrations of Mn in some groundwater aquifers in the camp sites. Mn is a neurotoxicant and previous studies have reported intellectual impairment in children exposed to Mn levels similar to those detected in groundwater in the camp sites. Nearly 450,000 migrant and new-born children live in the camps in already stressed conditions. The occurrence of elevated Mn concentrations in groundwater in the camps and their adjacent areas is likely an additional stressor exposing these children to an increased risk of neurotoxicity. Based on the results of this small-scale study, we recommend undertaking an in-depth study on the occurrence of Mn in groundwater in the camps to come up with appropriate strategies to minimise exposure. In addition, we recommend conducting a systematic epidemiological study on potential impacts of manganese in drinking water on neurological development of the Rohingya children in the camps.",
2776,"Divergent responses of ecosystem water-use efficiency to extreme seasonal droughts in Southwest China The recurrent drought extremes have resulted in deleterious impacts on ecological security. Despite that many attempts have been made to explore ecosystem responses to different severities of droughts, a deep understanding of how ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) responds to extreme seasonal droughts is critical for predicting the trends under future climate change, especially in the ecologically-fragile karst ecosystem across Southwest China. This study systematically examined the spatio-temporal variations of ecosystem WUE over the karst and non-karst areas, as well as their divergent responses to different seasonal droughts. Our findings revealed the apparent increase in drought frequency, duration, and severity in Southwest China during the past four decades. Meanwhile, spring and summer drought events were the prevailing drought types. Compared with the non-karst area, multi-year mean WUE in the karst area was relatively lower, whereas the area exhibiting significant increase in WUE (p < 0.01) accounted for 39.3% and 22.3%, respectively. However, the effects of drought on ecosystem WUE varied in different seasons with more severe consequence in the karst ecosystem. During the early stage of autumn-spring drought in 2009/2010, ecosystem WUE was apparently larger than the baseline condition with the difference turning to be negative anomalies during the peak period, whereas the effect of summer drought in 2011 led to negative anomalies nearly throughout the duration. Further analysis revealed that the anomalies in evapotranspiration acted a prominent role in altering WUE at the onset of both droughts, while ecosystem WUE was mainly determined by the sensitivity of gross primary production during the later stage. All analyses are beneficial for expecting the coupling relationship between global carbon and water cycles to future climate change, particularly as droughts are projected to increase in terms of frequency and severity.

2777,"Dietary arsenic exposure in bangladesh BACKGROUND: Millions of people in Bangladesh are at risk of chronic arsenic toxicity from drinking contaminated groundwater, but little is known about diet as an additional source of As exposure. METHODS: We employed a duplicate diet survey to quantify daily As intake in 47 women residing in Pabna, Bangladesh. All samples were analyzed for total As, and a subset of 35 samples were measured for inorganic arsenic (iAs) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry equipped with a dynamic reaction cell. RESULTS: Median daily total As intake was 48 microg As/day [interquartile range (IQR), 33-67) from food and 4 microg As/day (IQR, 2-152) from drinking water. On average, iAs comprised 82% of the total As detected in dietary samples. After adjusting for the estimated inorganic fraction, 34% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21-49%] of all participants exceeded the World Health Organization's provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) of 2.1 microg As/kg-day. Two of the 33 women who used a well with < 50 microg As/L exceeded this recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: When drinking water concentrations exceeded the Bangladesh drinking water standard of 50 microg As/L, ingested water was the dominant source of exposure. However, as drinking water As concentrations decrease, the relative contribution of dietary As sources becomes more important to ingested dose. The combined intake from both diet and drinking water can cause some individuals to exceed the PTDI in spite of using a tube well that contains < 50 microg As/L.",
2778,"Profile distribution of soil organic and inorganic carbon following revegetation on the Loess Plateau, China In arid and semiarid areas, which are characterized by fragile ecological systems, deforestation and tillage have resulted in a net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere. Vegetation restoration has great potential to alter the soil carbon stock. Exploring sustainable vegetation restoration for carbon sequestration in soils requires adequate information on soil carbon and soil water. The vertical distribution of soil organic/inorganic carbon (SOC/SIC) and soil water in the 0-200Â cm soil depth under cropland, forestland, shrubland, and grassland with restoration age (0-30Â years) in Zhifanggou watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau were investigated. The results showed that after 10Â years vegetation restoration, SOC content at topsoil in forestland, shrubland, and grassland increased significantly, and SIC content at subsoil in shrubland and grassland increased significantly due to more pedogenic carbonate formed by Ca(2+) derived from the decomposed litter and biogenic CO(2). The absolute values of the slopes of the linear regression patterns between SOC and SIC were in the order grassland > forestland and shrubland and indicate that under the grassland the increment in SIC is larger per unit decrement in SOC. After 20Â years vegetation restoration, the soil water content under forestland and shrubland decreased to 4.74%-6.16 and 4.08%-5.21% which are close to the wilting coefficient (5%) for the sandy loam soil in Zhifanggou watershed, resulting in the obstacle to sustainable land use. The conversion from cropland to natural grassland kept the relatively high level of soil water and may be the sustainable vegetation restoration approach to increase soil carbon.",
2779,"Geomorphological map of the Tiwanaku River watershed in Bolivia: Implications for past and present human occupation The Altiplano and more specifically the Titicaca circum-lake sector have recorded several major landscape transformations. In particular, changes in the lake water level lead to a significant vulnerability and contributed to the development of flexible and diverse agropastoral activities of the pre-Columbian and current populations to climate change. The Tiwanaku River, particularly because of the presence of the pre-Columbian Tiwanaku site, has been the subject of several research studies aimed at characterizing the environment of the archaeological site. Here we propose a new synthesis of the geomorphology of the Tiwanaku River watershed based on an interdisciplinary approach (Historical geography and remote sensing, cross combined with field survey). Our results show that the general organization of the drainage system is influenced by lake level and climatic changes. However several watercourses of the Tiwanaku River might be related to pre-Columbian agricultural or proto-urban structures. Our work allowed to estimate the regressive pattern of the coastline of Lake Titicaca and to identify major changes of the terminal and medium watercourse of the Tiwanaku River over the last 70 years.",
2780,"Groundwater Pollution Source Identification and Apportionment Using PMF and PCA-APCS-MLR Receptor Models in Tongchuan City, China Potential sources of groundwater pollution in Tongchuan City, China, were qualitatively identified based on 14 key water quality indicators of 59 groundwater samples, and the contribution of each source to groundwater quality was quantitatively evaluated. Groundwater pollution sources were analyzed using PMF and PCA-APCS-MLR models, and their applicability in groundwater pollution assessment in Tongchuan City was tested. Results indicate that both models identified four sources of groundwater contamination. Natural evolution was the main cause of groundwater pollution in the study area, followed by the coal industry, agriculture, and urbanization. Although the spatial distribution of pollution sources in the two models differed, the urbanized area to the east of the study area was more severely affected by sewage discharge, the west was more obviously affected by the coal industry, and the north was mainly polluted by agriculture. Both of the fitting results of the two models are good, but R(2) values obtained by the PMF model (0.4440-0.9991) were generally higher than those obtained by the PCA-APCS-MLR model (0.5180-0.9530), indicating that PMF model results were more accurate than the PCA-APCS-MLR model.",
2781,"A study of the members of the tribe Phasmatini Gray, 1835, that occur within the boundaries of Wallacea (Phasmatodea: Phasmatidae: Phasmatinae: ""Lanceocercata"") The tribe Phasmatini Gray, 1835 predominantly includes very striking stick insects of remarkable size, most of which are characteristic for their large and often colourful wings. The tribe represents roughly half of the Giant Stick Insects of Wallacea, a subregion in Eastern Indonesia comprising thousands of islands that are separated by deep water straits from the continental islands to the west (Sundaland: Borneo, Java and Sumatra) and East (New Guinea). Within Wallacea the Phasmatini are represented by four genera, namely Anchiale Stal, 1875, Eurycnema Audinet-Serville, 1838, Paracyphocrania Redtenbacher, 1908 and Phasma Lichtenstein, 1796. Currently eight distinct species are known to occur in the Wallacea. Two of these are newly described in the present paper, this is Anchiale buruense sp. n. and Paracyphocrania major sp. n.. Keys are provided for the distinction of the Phasmatini taxa of Wallacea and information on the overall distribution of the four genera is presented, which reveals a derivation of the tribe from the Australian region. The tribe Phasmatini itself is briefly characterized and discussed. Brief characterizations of the four genera are provided along with complete lists of the species currently contained. Anchiale Stal, 1875 is represented in the Wallacea by two species. A. maculata (Olivier, 1792) is widely distributed throughout Wallacea except for Sulawesi and shows considerable intraspecific variability. Both sexes and the eggs are illustrated and the eggs formally described for the first time. The synonymies of A. maculata are clarified. A. stolli Sharp, 1898 and A. confusa Sharp, 1898 from New Britain and the Solomon Islands are shown to be errorneous synonyms of A. maculata and are here re-established as valid species (stat. rev.). A. caesarea Redtenbacher, 1908 is removed from the genus Acrophylla Gray, 1835 and transferred to Anchiale (comb. n.). The new species A. buruense sp. n. from the island of Buru (Maluku Islands) is described and illustrated based on both sexes and the egg. Eurycnema Audinet-Serville, 1838 has two species within the boundaries of Wallacea. E. nigrospinosa Redtenbacher, 1908 is only known from the Kei Islands in the southeastern portion of Wallacea and otherwise found on New Guinea. Both sexes and the eggs are illustrated. E. versirubra Audinet-Serville, 1838 is found on some of the Lesser Sunda Islands and otherwise distributed throughout Java, Sumatra and SE-Borneo. The records from Java, Sumatra and southeast Borneo are estimated to be artificial. Females of this species are dimorph and occur in two distinct colour morphs, which differ by the distinct colouration of the undersides of the tegmina and alae. E. versirubra colour morph versirubra has two forms, the insects either being bright green or dull yellow with the ventral surfaces of the tegmina and alae bright red. E. versirubra colour morph versifasciata, has the ventral surfaces of the tegmina and alae yellow, the insects themselves being pale bluish green to turquoise in colour. Only the bright green form appears to be natural with the other colour-forms caused by parthenogenetic reproduction in captivity. Both sexes, the eggs and the two aforementioned colour-morphs are illustrated. Paracyphocrania Redtenbacher, 1908 contains two known species and is endemic to Sulawesi and the nearby island of Peleng. The new species Paracyphocrania major sp. n. from Peleng is described and illustrated based on the female and egg. The male remains as yet unknown. The previously unknown male of P. lativentris Redtenbacher, 1908 is described for the first time. Both sexes and the eggs are illustrated. Vasilissa tecticollis Redtenbacher, 1908 is shown to have been misinterpreted previously, here removed from Paracyphocrania and shown to be a synonym of the Australian Tropidoderus rhodomus McCoy, 1882 (syn. n.). Hence, the type-locality of V. tecticollis originally given as ""Philippines"" is definitely wrong, which proves the tribe Phasmatini is not represented in the Philippines at all. Phasma Lichtenstein, 1796 is rep esented in Wallacea with two distinct species and has one further species on New Guinea. A key is provided to distinguish between the three known species of Phasma. Ph. gigas (Linnaeus, 1758) is widely distributed throughout Wallacea and found on almost all major islands, although the historic records from Sulawesi deserve evaluation. Ph. gigas is most certainly not present on New Guinea, with all New Guinean records actually referring to Ph. reinwardtii (de Haan, 1842). Ph. gigas exhibits remarkable intraspecific variability in the colouration and certain morphological features of the insects, with several of these variations appearing to be peculiar to certain localities and islands. The range of variation as well as both sexes and the eggs are illustrated. Papuanoidea straleni Werner, 1930 from New Guinea has erroneously been synonymised with Ph. gigas and is here shown to be a synonym of Ph. reinwardtii (de Haan, 1842) (syn. n.). The second Wallacean representative of the genus, Ph. marosense Hennemann, 1998, is endemic to Sulawesi. The previously unknown male is described for the first time and both sexes and the eggs are illustrated. Holotypes of the two newly described species, Anchiale buruense sp. n. and Paracyphocrania major sp. n., are deposited in the State Zoological Collections Munich, Germany (ZSMC).",
2782,"Effect of cattle manure on soil physical properties on a sandy clay loam soil in North-West Iran Organic matter affects crops growth and yield either directly by supplying nutrients or indirectly by modifying soil physical properties such as stability of aggregates, porosity and available water capacity that can improve the root environment and stimulate plant growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of cattle manure on infiltration, available water capacity as well as some soil physical properties on a sandy clay loam soil lack of plant in Ardabil province, Iran. This objective was examined by supplying 9 iron cylinders of 57 cm in inner diameter and about 40 cm in height. The cylinders were filled with sandy clay loam soil of 30 cm in height. Cattle manure was applied at 0, 30 and 60 Mg ha(-1) at three replications in a completely random design. Nine months after cattle manure application, soil properties were measured. Statistical analysis showed that soil bulk density and particle density decreased significantly (P<0.05) and porosity, organic matter content and saturated hydraulic conductivity increased with application of 30 and 60 Mg ha(-1). After measuring infiltration, coefficients of Philip's equation (sorptivity (S) and constant coefficient (A)) were estimated by nonlinear regression using SPSS software. The results indicated that application of cattle manure did not significantly (P<0.05) affect S but showed effect on A significantly (P<0.05). Mean weight diameter (MWD) of the aggregates in 30 and 60 Mg ha(-1) treatments was significantly (P<0.05) greater than in control treatment. Available water capacity (AWC) decreased with application of 30 and 60 Mg ha(-1) but the statistical results showed AWC was just significantly (P<0.05) affected by application of 60 Mg ha(-1).",
2783,"Design of low impact development in the urban context considering hydrological performance and life-cycle cost The pressures on water system are increasing in cities. Rapid urbanisation caused by booming population leads to more impervious area and less infiltration, with the consequence of larger runoff volume and higher flood risk. Launched in 2014, the low impact development (LID), an important part of Sponge City in China initiative, invests in projects that aim to restore the water cycle in the urban area. A comprehensive understanding of the performance of LID measures at watershed scale under different rainfall scenarios and life cycle costs is necessary. The objectives of this study are to assess the hydrological performance and to identify the optimal LID design by using SWMM model and life cycle cost (LCC) method. This study found that LID practices, including bioretention, grass swale, and permeable pavement, showed good performance on urban storm mitigation at watershed scale under different rainfall scenarios. Furthermore, the rates of surface runoff reduction were largely insusceptible to the change of rainfall volume and duration. Regarding the cost-effectiveness, the priority was grass swale > bioretention > permeable pavement in the study area. The optimal LID scenario was the combination of these three types of LID. The proposed approach can help the decision-makers to determine the preferable LID plan suitable for the local communities.",
2784,"Yield and grape must composition in 'Cabernet Sauvignon' grape vine subjected to potassium fertilization in high altitude soil Potassium (K) increase in the soil can affect grape must yield and quality; and consequently, the quality of wine; however, studies in this field approaching altitude soil in Southern Brazil (used for viniculture) are scarce. The aim of the present study is to evaluate yield, critical K level in the leaves and their association with grape must composition in 'Cabernet Sauvignon' vines subjected to K application in high altitude soil in Southern Brazil. The experiment was performed in a 'Cabernet Sauvignon' vineyard subjected to the application of different K doses (0, 30 and 60 kg K2O ha(-1)) in three seasons. Potassium (K) availability in soil and leaves, as well as total soluble solids (TSS), pH, total titratable acidity (TA) content in grape must were evaluated. Potassium fertilizer applications increased K availability in the soil, but its concentration only increased in leaves collected at full bloom in the 2013/2014 season. Potassium applications in the soil did not affect yield, but K concentration increase in the leaves led to increased TSS and pH values in grape must, as well as to TA and tartaric acid decrease, a factor that can impair the quality of wine.",
2785,"Identifying the existence and molecular structure of the dissolved HCO3-Ca-As(V) complex in water Calcium(Ca2+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions co-exist with arsenic (As) in natural water systems, while Ca-based materials such as lime and cement are widely used to immobilize As(V) in contaminated solids. In this paper, a new dissolved ternary complex, HCO3-Ca-As(V), was discovered and its molecular structure was identified. The results from the batch experiments showed that adding As(V) to the solutions containing Ca2+ and HCO3- increased the dissolved Ca concentration from 4.8 to 73.2 mg/L at pH 11. Both infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicated the presence of dissolved HCO3-Ca-As(V) complex. Based on the quantitative geometric information obtained from the spectroscopic results, the molecule of (OH)OC-O-(OH2)(4)Ca-O-2-As(OH)(2) was identified by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Although Ca2+ and As(V) can form complex without HCO3-, the presence of HCO3- further enhanced the stability of the dissolved Ca complex, as evidenced by the lower binding energy (BE) of HCO3-Ca-As(V) (-329.1959 kJ/mol) than Ca-As(V) (4.7171 kJ/mol). The discovery of dissolved HCO3-Ca-As(V) complex is important for understanding the mobility of As(V) in natural water, and the possible release of As(V) in contaminated solids treated with Ca-based materials.

2786,"GC-MS- and NMR-Based Metabolomics and Molecular Docking Reveal the Potential Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors from Psychotria malayana Jack Leaves Psychotria malayana Jack leaf, known in Indonesia as ""daun salung "", is traditionally used for the treatment of diabetes and other diseases. Despite its potential, the phytochemical study related to its anti-diabetic activity is still lacking. Thus, this study aimed to identify putative inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase, a prominent enzyme contributing to diabetes type 2 in P. malayana leaf extract using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)- and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics, and to investigate the molecular interaction between those inhibitors and the enzyme through in silico approach. Twenty samples were extracted with different solvent ratios of methanol-water (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% v/v). All extracts were tested on the alpha-glucosidase inhibition (AGI) assay and analyzed using GC-MS and NMR. Multivariate data analysis through a partial least square (PLS) and orthogonal partial square (OPLS) models were developed in order to correlate the metabolite profile and the bioactivity leading to the annotation of the putative bioactive compounds in the plant extracts. A total of ten putative bioactive compounds were identified and some of them reported in this plant for the first time, namely 1,3,5-benzenetriol (1); palmitic acid (2); cholesta-7,9(11)-diene-3-ol (3); 1-monopalmitin (4); beta-tocopherol (5); alpha-tocopherol (6); 24-epicampesterol (7); stigmast-5-ene (8); 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (10); and glutamine (11). For the evaluation of the potential binding modes between the inhibitors and protein, the in silico study via molecular docking was performed where the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isomaltase (PDB code: 3A4A) was used. Ten amino acid residues, namely ASP352, HIE351, GLN182, ARG442, ASH215, SER311, ARG213, GLH277, GLN279, and PRO312 established hydrogen bond in the docked complex, as well as hydrophobic interaction of other amino acid residues with the putative compounds. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitors showed moderate to high binding affinities (-5.5 to -9.4 kcal/mol) towards the active site of the enzymatic protein, where compounds 3, 5, and 8 showed higher binding affinity compared to both quercetin and control ligand.</p>",
2787,"Soil heavy metal contamination assessment in the Hun-Taizi River watershed, China The Hun-Taizi River watershed includes the main part of the Liaoning central urban agglomeration, which contains six cities with an 80-year industrial history. A total of 272 samples were collected from different land use areas within the study area to estimate the concentration levels, spatial distributions and potential sources of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) with a geographic information system (GIS), principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Only the concentration of Cd was over the national standard value (GB 15618-2018). However, the heavy metal concentrations at 24.54%, 71.43%, 63.37%, 85.71, 70.33%, 53.11%, and 72.16% of the sampling points were higher than the local soil background values for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively, which were used as standard values in this study. The maximal values of Cd (16.61 times higher than the background value) and Hg (12.18 times higher than the background value) had high concentrations, while Cd was present in the study area at higher values than in some other basins in China. Cd was the primary pollutant in the study area due to its concentration and potential ecological risk contribution. The results of the potential ecological risk index (RI) calculation showed that the overall heavy metal pollution level of the soil was considerably high. Three groups of heavy metals with similar distributions and sources were identified through PCA. The results of the CCA showed that the distribution of mines was the strongest factor affecting the distributions of Ni, As, Zn, Pb, and Cd. However, Cu was strongly influenced by the distance to the nearest river. These findings can provide scientific support for critical planning and strategies for soil pollution control and removal to support the sustainable development of the study area.",
2788,"Evaluation of a Renewable Resource-based Carbon-Iron Oxide Nanocomposite for Removal of Arsenic from Contaminated Water High arsenic concentration in groundwater is found in many countries, including Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Thailand and United States. In these countries, the arsenic concentrations have reached dangerous levels for human consumption, especially where the main source of drinking water is from groundwater. Many techniques have been developed for arsenic removal, one being the use of iron oxide or magnetite nanoparticles for heavy metal removal. In this study, a novel tannin-based carbon-iron oxide composite has been developed by us for arsenic removal and results show that a concentration of 100 ppb As in water could be brought down to 10 ppb with the maximum capacity of the arsenic removal calculated to be 1.5 mg As/g Fe in the nanocomposite. The characterization of the nanocomposite and the advantages of using this renewable resource-based nanocomposite are also discussed.",
2789,"First detection of lead in black paper from intraoral film: an environmental concern Lead (Pb) contamination in the black paper that recovers intraoral films (BKP) has been investigated. BKP samples were collected from the Radiology Clinics of the Dental School of RibeirÃ£o Preto, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. For sake of comparison, four different methods were used. The results revealed the presence of high lead levels, well above the maximum limit allowed by the legislation. Pb contamination levels achieved after the following treatments: paper digestion in nitric acid, microwave treatment, DIN38414-54 method and TCLP method were 997 microg g(-1), 189 microg g(-1), 20.8 microg g(-1), and 54.0 microg g(-1), respectively. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were employed for lead determination according to the protocols of the applied methods. Lead contamination in used BKP was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS). All the SEM imaging was carried out in the secondary electron mode (SE) and backscattered-electron mode (QBSD) following punctual X-ray fluorescence spectra. Soil contamination derived from this product revealed the urgent need of addressing this problem. These elevated Pb levels, show that a preliminary treatment of BKP is mandatory before it is disposed into the common trash. The high lead content of this material makes its direct dumping into the environment unwise.",
2790,"Observations on arsenic exposure and health effects The current EPA risk assessment for ingestion of inorganic arsenic was published in 1988, based on analysis of epidemiologic data from the Blackfoot disease region of Taiwan. The components of the exposure-response assessment basically consist of a health effect endpoint (skin cancer), an exposure metric (arsenic concentration in well water used for drinking), a model (the Multistage-Weibull), and parameters for scaling risk to the U.S. population (body weight, water consumption rate). These form what might be called the current paradigm for arsenic risk assessment. The EPA risk assessment identifies several information gaps, some of which have been narrowed by research in the last ten years. While improved information will enhance risk estimation under the current paradigm, the emphasis in this article is on observations that suggest broadening the paradigm itself. In particular, it is proposed that the regions of the U.S. with the highest arsenic concentrations in drinking water supplies be surveyed for skin signs of arsenicism.",
2791,"Scale Effects on Water Use Efficiency and Productivity: A Case Study from UPRIIS, Philippines Increasing water productivity of irrigated rice remains the most promising challenge to tackle the increasing water scarcity problems. The aim of this study is, therefore, to measure scale effects on water productivity through water accounting coupled with remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) in rice-based irrigation system of District I of the Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System (UPRIIS), Philippines. The water accounting is applied at five different spatial scales to study water savings and impacts on different scales. The spatial scale ranges from a micro scale at the size of farmers field (area of 1 ha), to sub-irrigation canal scale (10,000 ha) and a system scale (area of 18,000 ha) covering the entire District I area. Daily measurements of all surface water inflows and outflows, rainfall, evapotranspiration, and amounts of water internally reused through check dams and shallow pumping are summed into seasonal totals, from November 19, 2000 to May 18, 2001 for five spatial scale units ranging from 1 to 18,000 ha. Water accounting technique is applied to measure performance indicators of the water productivity at each spatial scale. Results from a field scale show that water productivity per unit of delivered water is higher than all spatial scales due to best management practices and high input of fertilizers (180 kg/ha). The process fraction of gross inflow is very high which shows that farmers put lot of efforts to make full use of irrigation water and rainfall. These observations at field scales indicate that farmers are very effective in capturing and utilizing all water input. However, the amount of net surface water input (rainfall plus irrigation) per unit area decreases and the process fraction, depleted fraction, water productivity, and amount of water reuse increases with increasing spatial scale. In total, 57% of all available surface water is reused by check dams and 17% by pumping. The process fraction of all surface water input (irrigation and rainfall) is very high (0.71) at the field scale and it is relatively low (0.15) at TRIS-L scale but gradually increases with spatial scale up to 0.22 for all scale units combined. The major reason of improving water productivity is due to large volume of re-used water (30 % of water lost through ETa of rice) from 15 small check dams, hundreds of small farm ponds and 1451 pumps installed in District I. Water productivity with respect to ET of rice varies between 1.75 and 0.8 kg grain m(-3) water at field and District scale). The only option to increase WPET at large spatial scales is again crop protection measures such as pest and disease control and reduced post-harvest losses. The overall water productivity with respect to available water (WPavailable) is 0.45 kg grain m(-3) water, which compares well with the average of 0.4 kg grain m(-3) water for rice at the field level. At the field scale, the WPavailable is 1.25 kg grain m(-3) water, suggesting that there is considerable scope for improvement in the study area. The results show that water re-use plays a dominant role in the growth of a rice crop during the dry season. The finding shows that scale effects are important for understanding, planning for water saving and for planning appropriate measures to increase water productivity. The results clearly indicate that the quantification of volumes of water re-use is crucial for understanding and finding real water saving possibilities at the irrigation system level. These findings would lead to an improvement in the water use efficiency and water productivity of irrigated rice systems.",
2792,"Emerging contaminants in a river receiving untreated wastewater from an Indian urban centre Research over the last decade on emerging trace organic contaminants in aquatic systems has largely focused on sources such as treated wastewaters in high income countries, with relatively few studies relating to wastewater sources of these contaminants in low and middle income countries. We undertook a longitudinal survey of the Ahar River for a number of emerging organic contaminants (including pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal care products and industrial chemicals) which flows through the city of Udaipur, India. Udaipur is a city of approximately 450,000 people with no wastewater treatment occurring at the time of this survey. We found the concentrations of many of the contaminants within the river water were similar to those commonly reported in untreated wastewater in high income countries. For example, concentrations of pharmaceuticals, such as carbamazepine, antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ranged up to 1900 ng/L. Other organic contaminants, such as steroid estrogens (up to 124 ng/L), steroid androgens (up to 1560 ng/L), benzotriazoles (up to 11 mu g/L), DEET (up to 390 ng/L), BPA (up to 300 ng/L) and caffeine (up to 37.5 mu g/L), were all similar to previously reported concentrations in wastewaters in high income countries. An assessment of the population densities in the watersheds feeding into the river showed increasing population density of a watershed led to a corresponding downstream increase in the concentrations of the organic contaminants, with quantifiable concentrations still present up to 10 km downstream of the areas directly adjacent to the highest population densities. Overall, this study highlights how a relatively clean river can be contaminated by untreated wastewater released from an urban centre. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

2793,"Viability of the advanced adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model on reservoir evaporation process simulation: case study of Nasser Lake in Egypt Reliable prediction of evaporative losses from reservoirs is an essential component of reservoir management and operation. Conventional models generally used for evaporation prediction have a number of drawbacks as they are based on several assumptions. A novel approach called the co-active neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) is proposed in this study for the modeling of evaporation from meteorological variables. CANFIS provides a center-weighted set rather than global weight sets for predictor-predictand relationship mapping and thus it can provide a higher prediction accuracy. In the present study, adjustments are made in the back-propagation algorithm of CANFIS for automatic updating of membership rules and further enhancement of its prediction accuracy. The predictive ability of the CANFIS model is validated with three well-established artificial intelligence (AI) models. Different statistical metrics are computed to investigate the prediction efficacy. The results reveal higher accuracy of the CANFIS model in predicting evaporation compared to the other AI models. CANFIS is found to be capable of modeling evaporation from mean temperature and relative humidity only, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.93, which is much higher than that of the other models. Furthermore, CANFIS improves the prediction accuracy by 9.2-55.4% compared to the other AI models.",
2794,"Assessment of biostimulation and bioaugmentation for removing chlorinated volatile organic compounds from groundwater at a former manufacture plant Site in a former chemical manufacture plant in China was found contaminated with high level of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs). The major contaminants chloroform (CF), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) and vinyl chloride (VC) in groundwater were up to 4.49Â Ã—Â 10(4), 2.76Â Ã—Â 10(6) and 4.35Â Ã—Â 10(4) Î¼g/L, respectively. Ethene and methane were at concentrations up to 2219.80 and 165.85Â Î¼g/L, respectively. To test the hypothesis that the CVOCs in groundwater at this site could be removed via biodegradation, biomarker analyses and microcosm studies were conducted. Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA gene and VC-reductase gene vcrA at densities up to 1.5Â Ã—Â 10(4) and 3.2Â Ã—Â 10(4)Â copies/L were detected in some of the groundwater samples, providing strong evidence that dechlorinating bacteria were present in the aquifer. Results from the microcosm studies showed that at moderate concentrations (CF about 4000Â Î¼g/L and 1,2-DCA about 100Â Î¼g/L), CF was recalcitrant under natural condition but was degraded under biostimulation and bioaugmentation, while 1,2-DCA was degraded under all the three conditions. At high concentration (CF about 1,000,000Â Î¼g/L and 1,2-DCA about 20,000Â Î¼g/L), CF was recalcitrant under all the three treatments and 1,2-DCA was only degraded under bioaugmentation, indicating that high concentrations of contaminants were inhibitory to the bacteria. Electron donors had influence on the degradation of contaminants. Of the four fatty acids (pyruvate, acetate, propionate and lactate) examined, all could stimulate the degradation of 1,2-DCA at both moderate and high concentrations, whereas only pyruvate and acetate could stimulate the degradation of CF at moderate concentration. In the microcosms, the observed first-order degradation rates of CF and 1,2-DCA were up to 0.12 and 0.11/day, respectively. Results from the present study provided scientific basis for remediating CVOCs contaminated groundwater at the site.",
2795,"The changing role of geological surveys in Malaysia Geological survey was first set up in Malaysia in 1903 mainly to facilitate tin mining activities that were started in the 1820s. Nevertheless, upon merging with the Department of Mines to form the Department of Mineral and Geoscience Malaysia (JMG), and also in order to meet the changing national needs, the new department has become increasingly relevant to a wide range of important national issues that help improve the wellbeing of society and contribute to the socio-economic development, an aspect that this paper describes. The changing role of the department is well reflected by the department being listed as a member of more than 57 technical committees in the country in the field of land-use planning, groundwater-resources management and mitigation of hazards. As we advance into the future, the department needs to ensure it is capable of rendering a more holistic service covering a wider spectrum of geological and geoscience activities to cater for the ever-increasing demands from society, industries, stakeholders and the government. For that reason, the Geological Survey Act, 1974 is being revised to beef up and provide the necessary jurisdiction in line with the duties, responsibilities and roles played by the JMG.",
2796,"Sustainable land management interventions lead to carbon sequestration in plant biomass and soil in a mixed crop-livestock system: the case of Geda watershed, central highlands of Ethiopia Background Sustainable land management interventions were introduced in Geda watershed in 2012 to reduce soil erosion, improve water infiltration, and increase plant-carbon inputs into the soil. This study explored the impact of the interventions on biomass production, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration. Stratified sampling was employed in the main and the dry seasons in the treated and untreated sub-watersheds that are found adjacent to each other. Above- and below-ground plant biomass, soil bulk density and organic carbon in 0-15- and 15-30-cm depths, and soil moisture content in 0-20- and 20-40-cm depths were collected from the crop, grazing, and tree lucerne plots. All analyses were performed based on standard procedures. Results Plant biomass production, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration varied highly significantly (P <= 0.001) among sub-watersheds, landscape positions, and land uses. Higher mean values were observed for treated sub-watershed, lower landscape position, and tree lucerne plot. The higher mean values in the lower landscape position of the treated sub-watershed were due to tree lucerne plantation. Similarly, topsoil (0-15 cm) carbon stock was statistically higher (P <= 0.001) in the treated sub-watershed and at tree lucerne plot (P <= 0.05). In addition, carbon stock by sub-surface soil (15-30 cm) was significantly higher (P <= 0.001) in the treated sub-watershed under crop and grazing lands but the higher value was in cropland and in the upper position. This could be due to the decomposition of organic materials from biomasses of crops and biological supporting measures (tree lucerne andPhalaris) facilitated by tillage. Six years of sustainable land management interventions led to the sequestration of 12.25, 7.77, and 13.5 Mg C ha(-1)under cropland, tree lucerne, and grazing plots, respectively. Conclusion Sustainable land management interventions revealed auspicious ecological impacts in Geda watershed in terms of improving plant biomass production, carbon stock, and correspondingly capturing higher carbon dioxide equivalent taking untreated sub-watershed as a baseline. Prohibition of free grazing was the key element of the intervention to reduce biomass export and increase carbon sequestration in the treated sub-watershed. Thus, sustaining tree lucerne plants as a conservation measure and the prohibition of free grazing practices are principally essential.",
2797,"National air pollution distribution in China and related geographic, gaseous pollutant, and socio-economic factors Regional specification of PM(2.5) pollution characteristics is crucial for pollution control and policymaking. Spatiotemporal variations of six criteria air pollutants and influencing factors in China were studied using hourly concentrations of PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), CO, and O(3) from 2015 to 2016. China was categorized into eight regions: north-east, northern coastland, eastern coastland, southern coastland, Yellow River middle reaches, Yangtze River middle reaches, south-west, and north-west. The 29 exemplary cities in China were also researched. It was found that the PM(2.5) concentration in the northern coastland (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-Shandong) was the highest (72.28â€¯Î¼g.m(-3)) among the eight regions, particularly in the city of Baoding, Hebei, which had an annual average PM(2.5) concentration of 98.53â€¯Î¼g.m(-3). Average PM(2.5) concentrations in 2015 and 2016 of China were 50.16 Î¼g.m(-3) and 46.61â€¯Î¼g.m(-3), respectively. Compared with 2015, the PM(2.5) concentration decreased by 8.41% in 2016, the decline of PM(2.5) in summer was the largest, followed by autumn, spring and winter. The average mean PM(2.5) concentrations of the 29 exemplary cities in 2015 and 2016 were 54.66 Î¼g.m(-3) and 48.37â€¯Î¼g.m(-3), respectively, exceeding the limit for grade 2 of the national standards (35â€¯Î¼g.m(-3)). National air pollution distribution has exploded geographically with influence of regional economic factors. Gaseous pollutant as well as geographical and socio-economic conditions influenced PM(2.5) emissions. Effects of these factors on PM(2.5) emissions varied across regions and decreased continuously from the northern region to the south-west and eastern coastland regions. This paper clearly identifies the regional characteristics and distribution of PM(2.5), focusing on the effects of gaseous pollutant, geography and socio-economic development. Secondary transformation and vehicle exhaust across regions should be further studied.",
2798,"Development of freshwater aquatic life criteria for tetrabromobisphenol A in China Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is the most widely used brominated flame retardant. It has been detected in the environment and has shown to high toxicity to aquatic organisms. To date no aquatic life criteria for TBBPA have been proposed. This work compiled all literature toxicity data of TBBPA on Chinese aquatic species. Eight resident Chinese aquatic organisms were used in toxicity tests to supplement the existing toxicity data for TBBPA. Ten genera mean acute values and three genera mean chronic values to freshwater aquatic animals, as well as two genera toxicity values to aquatic plants were collected. A criterion maximum concentration of 0.1475 mg/L and a criterion continuous concentration of 0.0126 mg/L were derived based on these data, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. These criteria may be useful in risk assessment of TBBPA in the ambient water environment.",
2799,"Water infiltration in urban soils and its effects on the quantity and quality of runoff Urban soil characteristics, especially soil physical properties, are subject to dramatic changes due to compaction by intensive human activities, which may cause frequent flood events during the rainy seasons. The aim of this study was to explore the water infiltration characteristics of urban soils with different degrees of compaction and to determine the effects of infiltration on environmental problems in urban areas. Ten typical land use patterns with various vegetation and age were selected in Nanjing City, China to determine the infiltration rates by the dual-ring method. Three replicated sites were done in the same combined mode. At the same time, other soil physical and chemical properties that may affect infiltration rate were also determined. In addition, urban surface runoff coefficients were estimated according to final infiltrations and rain intensities in the different degrees of soil compaction. The quality of flood water from a strong rainstorm in a main road in Nanjing was analyzed. The final infiltration rates of urban soils were highly variable (from very slow to very fast). Low soil infiltration rates are related to many factors; however, urban soil compaction is the leading one. Infiltration rates decreased with an increase in the bulk density and with a reduction in the air-filled porosity. Thus, large amounts of macropores increase the infiltration rate and reduce surface runoff. Runoff coefficients of compacted soils with low infiltration rates were high, especially for extremely compacted soil. As a result, the prevalence of flooding is high in compacted soils, and the quality of surface runoff water is reduced during flooding events. The concentrations of NO (3) (-) -N, total nitrogen, molybdate-reactive phosphorus, total phosphors, and suspended material in urban surface runoff were significantly higher than those observed in forested or agricultural watersheds. In urban areas, low infiltration rates caused by soil compaction have negative effects on the eco-environment of the city and result in increased instantaneous flooding and poor surface water quality. Thus, to improve the eco-environment of urban areas, the amount of greenbelt soil must be increased and soil compaction must be reduced.",
2800,"Abuja slums: development, causes, waste-related health challenges, government response and way-forward Slum development, growth and attendant challenges of waste generation and management and environmental health challenges are issues for concern in developing countries where waste and environmental management infrastructure are deficit, decaying and moribund. This study aimed to ascertain the slums in Abuja and their characteristics, the actual causes of slum development and growth in Abuja, and the waste generation and management situation in Abuja slums, as well as establish the environmental health challenges arising from waste generation and management in Abuja slums, ascertain government responses to slums development and growth in Abuja, and advocate ways-out and ways-forward. The study adopted field survey, oral interview and laboratory tests of water and soil samples for concentration levels of poisonous metals using the Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Principal component analysis of Factor Analysis was used to select significant causes, environmental health challenges, government responses, and ways-out and ways-forward from those suggested by respondents. Findings showed that there were thirty (30) slums in Abuja. The actual causes of slum development were poverty, inequality, inadequate and non-affordable housing for all classes of the citizenry, rural-urban migration, urbanization, poor house planning, poor infrastructure, social exclusion, economic stagnation, informal economy, and labour and work. Waste generation and management situation was unhealthy with poor sanitation practices. Correlation matrix showed significance level above 99% for all indicators. Factor scores showed a perfect correlation above confidence level of 0.05 and very high significance level above 99% in all matrix variables. Open drains and waste dumps characterized Abuja ghettoes and were significant precursors of the outbreak of health devastating diseases in Abuja slums through pollution of air, domestic water sources and soil. Correlation matrix for environmental health challenges showed significance scores above 99% and correlation matrix scores were above 0.5 for all indicators. Water and soil in the slums were highly polluted by toxic metals. Against the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 0.05 mg/litre for Cd, 0.03 mg/litre for Cr and 0.4 mg/litre for Pb, heavy metal concentration in water sources was too high at 1.1-1.9 mg/litre for Cd, 1.4-1.6.4 mg/litre for Cr and 1.5-1.6 mg/litre for Pb. Heavy metals concentrations in the soil were too high at 4.6-6.2 mg/kg for Cd, 4.9-6.4 mg/kg for Cr and 5.9-6.7 mg/kg for Pb, against the World Health Organization standard of 1.7 mg/kg for Cd, 1.43 mg/kg for Cr and 4.54 mg/kg for Pb. The calculated F value for all the heavy metals was higher than the critical F value of 4.76 at 3 and 6 degrees of freedom with confidence level of 0.05, and the calculated significance level was above 99% in all the variables. Government adopted slums demolition as a solution to unwanted slums development and growth. The study recommended government interventions and initiatives, particularly in poverty reduction; effective implementation of environmental policies, particularly in the area of refuse disposal; slum upgrading programmes and their scaling up as ways-out of the messy slums development and growth and ways-forward.",
2801,"A comparative evaluation of groundwater suitability for irrigation and drinking purposes in two intensively cultivated districts of Punjab, India Punjab is the most cultivated state in India with the highest consumption of fertilizers. Patiala and Muktsar districts are two agricultural dominated districts of Punjab located in extreme south-east and south-west of the state. This paper highlights temporal variations of the groundwater quality and compares its suitability for irrigation and drinking purpose in these two districts. Water samples were collected in March and September 2003, representing the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Water samples were analysed for almost all major cations, anions, dissolved heavy metals and turbidity. Parameters like sodium adsorption ratio, % sodium, residual sodium carbonate, total hardness, potential salinity, Kelley's ratio, magnesium ratio, index of base exchange and permeability index were calculated on the basis of chemical data. A questionnaire was also used to investigate perception of villagers on taste and odour. Comparison of the concentration of the chemical constituents with WHO (world health organization) drinking water standards of 2004 and various classifications show that present status of groundwater in Patiala is better for irrigation and drinking purposes except for a few locations with a caution that it may deteriorate in near future. In Muktsar, groundwater is not suitable for drinking. Higher total hardness (TH) and total dissolved solids at numerous places indicate the unsuitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation. Results obtained in this forms baseline data for the utility of groundwater. In terms of monsoon impact, Patiala groundwater shows dilution and flushing but Muktsar samples show excessive leaching of different chemical components into the groundwater leading to the enrichment of different anions and cations indicating pollution from extraneous sources. No clear correlation between the quality parameters studied here and perceived quality in terms of satisfactory taste response were obtained at electrical conductivity values higher than the threshold minimum acceptable value.",
2802,"Clockwise rotation of the Santa Marta massif and simultaneous Paleogene to Neogene deformation of the Plato-San Jorge and Cesar-Rancheria basins A moderate amount of vertical-axis clockwise rotation of the Santa Marta massif (30 degrees) explains as much as 115 km of extension (stretching of 1.75) along its trailing edge (Plato-San Jorge basin) and up to 56 km of simultaneous shortening with an angular shear of 0.57 along its leading edge (Perija range). Extensional deformation is recorded in the 260 km-wide, fan-shaped Plato-San Jorge basin by a 2-8 km thick, shallowing-upward and almost entirely fine-grained, upper Eocene and younger sedimentary sequence. The simultaneous initiation of shortening in the Cesar-Rancheria basin is documented by Mesozoic strata placed on to lower Eocene syntectonic strata (Tabaco Formation and equivalents) along the northwest-verging, shallow dipping (9-12 degrees to the southeast) and discrete Cerrejon thrust. First-order subsidence analysis in the Plato-San Jorge basin is consistent with crustal stretching values between 1.5 and 2, also predicted by the rigid-body rotation of the Santa Marta massif. The model predicts about 100 km of right-lateral displacement along the Oca fault and 45 km of left-lateral displacement along the Santa Marta-Bucaramanga fault. Clockwise rotation of a rigid Santa Marta massif, and simultaneous Paleogene opening of the Plato-San Jorge basin and emplacement of the Cerrejon thrust sheet would have resulted in the fragmentation of the Cordillera Central-Santa Marta massif province. New U/Pb ages (241 +/- 3 Ma) on granitoid rocks from industry boreholes in the Plato-San Jorge basin confirm the presence of fragments of a now segmented, Late Permian to Early Triassic age, two-mica, granitic province that once spanned the Santa Marta massif to the northernmost Cordillera Central.

2803,"Isotopic composition of precipitation during strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation events in the Southeast Region of Brazil Equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature variations interact with processes of atmospheric circulation, creating conditions for the occurrence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO events represent the most important interannual phenomena affecting climate patterns worldwide and causing significant socio-economic impacts. In the Brazilian territory, ENSO leads to an increase in drought episodes in the north-eastern region and an increase in precipitation in the southern region, whereas the effects over the south-east region are yet not well understood. The main goal of this study is to compare variations of isotopic composition in precipitation across the south-east portion of the Brazilian territory during two very strong ENSO events: 1997-1998 (ENSO 1) and 2014-2016 (ENSO 2). Daily isotopic records, available from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation database for ENSO 1, and samples collected during ENSO 2 were used to compare the influence of both events on the isotopic composition of precipitation. Seasonal variations indicated more depleted precipitation during the wet seasons (delta O-18=-5.4 +/- 4.0 parts per thousand) and enriched precipitation during the dry seasons (delta O-18=-2.8 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand). Observed rainfall variations were associated with atmospheric large-scale processes and moisture transport from the Amazon region, whereas extreme values (enriched or depleted) appear to be associated with particular convective and stratiform precipitation events. Overall, more depleted isotopic composition of precipitation (delta O-18=-4.60 parts per thousand) and higher d-excess (up to +15 parts per thousand) were observed during the dry season of ENSO 1 when compared with ENSO 2 dry season (delta O-18 parts per thousand=-2.80 parts per thousand, d-excess lower than +14 parts per thousand). The latter is explained by greater atmospheric moisture content, particularly associated with recycling of transpiration fluxes from the Amazon region, during dry season of ENSO 1. No significant differences for delta O-18 and H-2 were observed during the wet season; however, d-excess from ENSO 2 was greater than ENSO 1, due to the slightly greater atmospheric moisture content and very strong upward motion observed. Our findings highlight the opportunity that environmental isotopes offer towards understanding hydrometeorological processes, particularly, the evolution of extreme climatic events of global resonance such as ENSO.",
2804,"Biochar Surface Functionality Plays a Vital Role in (Im)Mobilization and Phytoavailability of Soil Vanadium The potential of biochar with different surface functionalities to immobilize soil vanadium (V) and reduce its phytoavailability has not been studied. We investigated the effects of different doses (0, 2.5, and 5%) of three biochars derived from rice hull and wood residues on fractionation, mobilization, and plant uptake of V in an acidic soil contaminated with V (3750 mg kg(-1)). Application of wood biochar, with high O-containing functional groups, at 2.5% decreased the water-soluble V by 46% and the soluble + exchangeable V by 32% in soil, as well as reduced the V uptake by corn and sorghum up to 86% in shoots and 65% in roots. Application of wood and rice hull biochars, with low O-containing functional groups, increased V solubility, and thus corn and sorghum were incapable of growing in treated soils. The higher reactive surface, acidity, abundance of various O-containing functional groups, and hydrophilicity of the former wood biochar contributed to its superior performance. Solubility of V increased with the biochar-induced increase of soil pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Soil acidity and aromaticity of DOC are the main factors responsible for V immobilization. These results may help to elucidate the role of biochar in the sustainable management of V-contaminated soils.",
2805,"First record of the Asian diaptomid Neodiaptomus schmackeri (Poppe & Richard, 1892) ( Crustacea: Copepoda: Calanoida) in Europe Albania, as well as a great part of the Balkan area in general, still suffers a lack of environmental studies especially in limnological research. The Dumre plateau, in Central Albania, is characterized by an extraordinary high number of karst lakes in a small geographic area. Despite their environmental peculiarity, very few biological data are to date available for these lakes, none on the zooplankton. For this reason, 15 water bodies located in the central area of the plateau were selected for a preliminary limnological survey carried out in the years 2008-2011. Neodiaptomus schmackeri (Poppe & Richard, 1892), a diaptomid calanoid copepod characterized by a South-Eastern Palearctic - Oriental distribution, and the most widely spread Neodiaptomus species in Asia, was found in 8 lakes of the Dumre area. This finding represents the first record of the species, and of the entire genus Neodiaptomus, for Europe. Several environmental variables were measured to characterize the lakes, and the co-occurring planktonic crustaceans were also identified. Taxonomical drawings and descriptions of the main morphological features of both sexes are herein provided in order to compare the Albanian populations of N. schmackeri with those of the native distribution area of the species. The possible causes which determined the occurrence of this non-indigenous species in several Dumre lakes are discussed.",
2806,"Genesis and age of the Toudaoliuhe breccia-type gold deposit in the Jiapigou mining district of Jilin Province, China: Constraints from fluid inclusions, H-O-S-Pb isotopes, and sulfide Rb-Sr dating The Jiapigou mining district (JMD) in the northeastern part of the North China Block mainly contains quartz vein- and altered rock-type gold deposits that have been prospected and mined for over 200 years. Recently, a breccia-type gold deposit, known as Toudaoliuhe, was discovered in the JMD, that has attracted attention for prospecting and exploration. In this paper, we report the ore geology, gold-bearing sulfide (i.e., pyrite, galena, and sphalerite) Rb-Sr age, fluid inclusions (FIs), and H-O-S-Pb-Sr isotope data of the Toudaoliuhe gold deposit to determine its genesis and ore-forming mechanisms. Gold orebodies mainly occur in the breccia cements, as well as in several quartz veins controlled by NW-trending brittle faults. There were three hydrothermal stages: the early (quartz-pyrite), main (quartz-polymetallic sulfide), and late (quartz-carbonate) stages. Gold mineralization occurred in the main hydrothermal stage. Three types of FIs were identified: CO2-H2O-NaCl (C-type), H2O-NaCl (W-type), and pure CO2 (PC-type). The FIs in quartz from the early hydrothermal stage are predominantly of the C- and W-types (with traces of PC-type), and have homogenization temperatures of 299.8-340.0 degrees C and salinities of 6.5-14.8 wt% NaCl equivalent (E). The FIs in the quartz and sphalerite forming the main hydrothermal stage are also predominantly of the C- and W-types (with trace PC type), and have homogenization temperatures of 169.1-298.7 degrees C and salinities of 5.7-16.5 wt% E. The FIs in the quartz and calcite from the late hydrothermal stage were solely of the W-type, and have homogenization temperatures of 126.0-210.2 degrees C and salinities of 2.1-11.4 wt% E. The ore-forming fluids are characterized by moderate temperature and low salinity, suggesting a CO2-H2O-NaCl system. The H-O-S-Pb-Sr isotopic results suggest that the ore-forming fluids were dominated by magmatic water, and that the ore-forming materials were mainly extracted from the Middle Jurassic magmatic reservoir (177-163 Ma), sourced mainly from the lower crust with trace mantle components. Fluid boiling was the dominant mechanism for gold and associated sulfide precipitation. The Rb-Sr isochron age of the gold-bearing sulfides at 177.7 +/- 1.7 Ma indicates that gold mineralization occurred in the early Middle Jurassic. We therefore proposed that the Toudaoliuhe is a mesothermal gold deposit that formed in an extensional setting related to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath the Eurasian continent.",
2807,"Health Risk Assessment of Nitrate Pollution in Shallow Groundwater: A Case Study in China High concentrations of nitrate in groundwater pose a threat to human health. To quantify groundwater nitrate pollution in China's Lianhuashan District and evaluate its human health risks, 73 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed. Results showed that the spatial distribution of groundwater chemical components was varied and concentrations were in the order of TDS>HCO3>Ca> Cl>SO4> Na>Mg>NO3>K>NH4 >NO2 center dot NO3 concentrations ranged from 0.02-340.49 mg/L and averaged 70.38 mg/L. Over 28.76% of samples exceeded the QSCB Class III threshold (20 mg/L N). Principal component analysis determined that NO3 contamination was primarily attributed to the excessive use of fertilizers in agriculture. A human health risk assessment model was used to assess the potential health risks of groundwater NO3 via drinking water and skin contact pathways. Approximately 94% of adults, 86% of children, and 66% of infants had acceptable health risks. NO3 exposure risk in the towns of Quanyan and Quannongshan were the highest, while urban areas tended to have lower exposures. The health risks to residents, especially minors and infants, were concerning.",
2808,"System dynamics simulation of regional water supply and demand using a food-energy-water nexus approach: Application to Qazvin Plain, Iran Understanding the complexity and feedbacks among food, energy, and water (FEW) systems is key to making informed decisions about sustainable development. This paper presents qualitative representation and quantitative system dynamics simulation of the water resources system in the Qazvin Plain, Iran, taking into account the energy intensity of water supply and interconnected water use sectors (e.g., urban, industrial, and agricultural). Qazvin Plain faces water resources challenges that are common to arid/semi-arid areas, including frequent droughts, declining surface water and groundwater, and increased urban and agricultural water demand. A system dynamics model is developed using historical data (2006-2016) to investigate the effects of anticipated dynamics of integrated water and energy sectors in the next two decades. The results of policy scenarios (2020-2039) demonstrate that the continuation of the existing management policies will cause severe damage to the water and energy sectors, pushing the system towards water resources limits to growth. An annual groundwater table decline of nearly 1Â m is anticipated, indicating significant overshoot of the plain's natural recharge capacity, which may lead to the depletion of recoverable groundwater in the plain within the next three decades. The groundwater table decline will cause energy consumption of water supply to increase by about 32% (i.e., 380Â GWh) to maintain irrigated agriculture. It is critical to implement a combination of water demand and supply management policies (e.g., net agricultural water savings and recycling treated wastewater) to delay the problem of water limits to growth in the region.",
2809,"Introduction to hydrogeochemistry, environmental impacts and management practices Contamination of groundwater sources is a global phenomenon and it?s becoming evident that unregulated human activity will lead to further deterioration of the resource in many countries of the world. There is therefore an increasing need for research and informed policies to strategically manage groundwater along with other natural resources. This book has been structured into ten chapters, including an introductory background and contextual material for its contributions, with case studies from US, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Serbia, India, Malaysia, Netherlands and South Africa. Contributions in this book range from hydrogeochemical investigations and evaluation of groundwater usability for water supply as well as for agricultural purposes to groundwater quality descriptions and characterisation. Issues on groundwater overdevelopment and the consequent quality degradation; flow and recharge processes with management implications; groundwater dependent ecosystems and ecological implications are well covered in its content. A number of simulation variants from numerical modelling to characterise groundwater conditions and estimate groundwater resources potential in large basins are presented to support technical decisions and policy making. The prospects and problems of groundwater development are addressed in this book and novel bioremediation technology with more than 10 years of successful application in remediating groundwater contaminated with chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) concludes the content. This book will be useful to all within the groundwater community, researchers and policy makers alike. Â© 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",
2810,"Pipe dreams? Practices of everyday governance of heterogeneous configurations of water supply in Baruipur, a small town in India This article compares a networked and a non-networked artefact and the diverse practices of everyday governance around these localised configurations of water infrastructure in Baruipur, a peripheral and rapidly urbanising small town in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Plagued by arsenic contamination, the state has been pushing to expand and consolidate a networked piped infrastructure bringing in treated surface water. This shift threatens to reconfigure the existing diverse infrastructure configurations that are fragmented, incremental in nature. We examine the scholarship on the situated and embodied forms of Urban Political Ecology to understand how everyday social relations and plural practices at the level of the town, the 'para' (roughly neighbourhood), and the household to understand how socio-material artefacts shape lived experiences and local networks of power. The shift in the socio-technical configurations, in turn, lead to new forms of power coalitions, network conflicts, and collaborations. Through an in-depth qualitative examination, we conclude that heterogeneous infrastructure configurations and everyday practices are not only gendered but also intricately embedded within intersections of social affinity, intimate geographies, and embodied class power relations in the 'para'.",
2811,"Assessment of selected major and trace elements in groundwater of Lagos based on land use and implication on human health Sixty-seven (67) groundwater samples from different land use areas such as dumpsites, industrial, markets and residential all within Lagos, southwest Nigeria, were sampled and sent to ACME Laboratories, Ontario, Canada, for geochemical analysis to determine some essential and toxic elements using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer method. The purpose was to establish baseline values for the geochemical composition of groundwater in some parts of Lagos as well as the health risk assessment. Based on essential elements, 83%, 80% and 100% of groundwater samples were deficient in Ca, Mg and Se, respectively, while 75%, 10%, 7% and 8% of samples can be categorised as soft, moderately hard, hard and very hard water, respectively. The soft water, as well as different deficiencies in water, had been linked to heart problems, impeded growth, fertility disorders and liver diseases. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni and Fe were higher than recommended standards in 2.94%, 1.5%, 1.5%, 29.4%, 4.4% and 4.7% of groundwater samples, respectively. Groundwater in the study area can be classified between not contaminated (< 1) to very highly contaminated (CI > 5) based on the contamination index. Highly contaminated samples were within dumpsites and industrial areas. The land-use activities have a direct or indirect impact on groundwater quality. The apparent sources of groundwater pollutants include industrial discharge, effluents, leachates and municipal wastes. The result of total health risk index for both ingestion and dermal exposure to water showed values far > 1 for all the toxic elements and generally pose non-carcinogenic health risk hazards for child and adult population in the study area. THI for samples from residential, market, industrial and dumpsites showed mean values of (9.60 and 3.75), (14.17 and 5.37), (9.8 and 3.4) and 95.44 and 37.48) for child and adult population, respectively. The degree of contamination in groundwater showed the following trends: dumpsite > industrial > markets > residential in the study area.",
2812,"The hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the thermal waters in the Mouil Graben, Sabalan volcano, NW Iran The emerging temperature of thermal springs within the Mouil Graben in the Sabalan volcano, a primary prospect for a geothermal power plant in Iran, varies from about 24 to 80 degrees C. The investigation was carried out by analyzing hydrogeochemistry (i.e., main cations and anions, trace elements and heavy metals) and environmental isotopes (i.e., delta O-18, delta H-2, tritium, and delta C-18) of water from cold and thermal springs, deep wells and the Khiavchay River over the period from 1979 to 2016. The results were also combined with those from a geo-structural survey. The findings reveal that the ascending geothermal fluids around the summit of the Sabalan volcano primarily move into the Mouil Graben fault system where the intersection of the caldera rim faults and the main oblique-slip faults occur at the lowest topographic elevation around the volcano as an emergent dome. The waters in the graben can be categorized into four clusters G1 to G4. The thermal springs which are categorized into groups G1 and G2 result from the contribution of geothermal waters and/or the condensation of the geothermal steam into near-surface waters. The spring waters of group G1 are characterized by being of the chloride water type with the highest values for temperature and EC. The waters of this group predominantly result from the contribution of geothermal water and are then more appropriate for geothermometry. The spring waters of group G2 are characterized by acidic-sulfate water type with lower values for temperature and EC. The waters of this group which predominantly arise from the condensation of geothermal steam, are mainly cold and enriched by H2S into near-surface waters or steam heated waters and are not appropriate for thermometry. Notably, delta O-18 of the GI water samples has a significant positive shift while in the G2 water samples there is either no shift or a small positive shift. The cold spring waters with a low delta O-18 ratio (G3 and G4) originate from precipitation percolated into the surrounding highlands. Moreover, it can be concluded that the controlling silica phase in the Mouil reservoir is quartz and the average temperature calculated by the quartz geothermometer (maximum steam loss) for the water samples from the deep wells is about 225-230 degrees C which is near the range of values determined in the deep wells (230-242 degrees C). The temperatures calculated for the water samples from the deep wells by the cation geothermometers of Na-K (169-349 degrees C), Na-K-Ca 174 to higher than 300 degrees C), Na-K-Ca-Mg (268 to higher than 350 degrees C), Mg-Li (167-266 degrees C), and Na-Li (226-258 degrees C) are higher than the temperature range determined in the deep wells (230-242 degrees C). The average temperature calculated for the water samples from the springs of group G1 using all the silica geothermometers ( < 196 degrees C) and the cation geothermometers of Na-K (236-290 degrees C), Na-K-Ca (194-221 degrees C), Na-K-Ca-Mg (more than 350 degrees C), and Mg-Li (similar to 64-126 degrees C) is different from the temperature range measured in the deep wells except that calculated by the Na-Li geothermometer (173-250 degrees C and 226 degrees C on average) which is relatively close to the measured range. The common discharging gas from the deep wells is CO2 (about 98% of the total gas). It seems that the volatile gases discharging from the deep wells come from a mixture of crustal/mantle and meteoric gas. The deep well gas samples lie well below the air saturation water line.",
2813,"Titanite-bearing calc-silicate rocks constrain timing, duration and magnitude of metamorphic CO2 degassing in the Himalayan belt The pressure, temperature, and timing (P-T-t) conditions at which CO2 was produced during the Himalayan pro grade metamorphism have been constrained, focusing on the most abundant calc-silicate rock type in the Himalaya. A detailed petrological modeling of a clinopyroxene + scapolite + K-feldspar + plagioclase + quartz +/- calcite calc-silicate rock allowed the identification and full characterization - for the first time - of - different metamorphic reactions leading to the simultaneous growth of titanite and CO2 production. The results of thermometric determinations (Zr-in-Ttn thermometry) and U-Pb geochronological analyses suggest that, in the studied lithology, most titanite grains grew during two nearly consecutive episodes of titanite formation: a near-peak event at 730-740 degrees C, 10 kbar, 30-26 Ma, and a peak event at 740-765 degrees C, 10.5 kbar, 25-20 Ma. Both episodes of titanite growth are correlated with specific CO2-producing reactions and constrain the timing, duration and P-T conditions of the main CO2-producing events, as well as the amounts of CO2 produced (1.4-1.8 wa of CO2). A first-order extrapolation of such CO2 amounts to the orogen scale provides metamorphic CO2 fluxes ranging between 1.4 and 19.4 Mt/yr; these values are of the same order of magnitude as the present-day CO2 fluxes degassed from spring waters located along the Main Central Thrust. We suggest that these metamorphic CO2 fluxes should be considered in any future attempts of estimating the global budget of non-volcanic carbon fluxes from the lithosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

2814,"Geological and hydrogeochemical controls on radium isotopes in groundwater of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt Radium isotopes ((226)Ra and (228)Ra) were analyzed in 18 groundwater samples from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) and the shallow alluvial aquifers overlying the basement complex of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Groundwater samples from deep Nubian aquifer wells (total depths 747 to 1250m) have (226)Ra and (228)Ra activities ranging from 0.168 to 0.802 and 0.056 to 1.032Bq/L, respectively. The shallower Nubian aquifer wells (63 to 366m) have (226)Ra and (228)Ra activities ranging from 0.033 to 0.191 and 0.029 to 0.312Bq/L, respectively. The basement shallow alluvial aquifers have (226)Ra and (228)Ra activities ranging from 0.014 to 0.038 and 0.007 to 0.051Bq/L, respectively. Combined Ra activities in most wells were generally in excess of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the European Union (EU), and the World Health Organization (WHO) maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for drinking water. Radium in groundwater is produced mainly by decay of parent nuclides in the aquifer solids, and observed activities of dissolved Ra isotopes result from a combination of alpha-recoil, adsorption/desorption, co-precipitation/dissolution processes. The observed correlation between Ra activities and salinity indicates that adsorption/desorption processes may be the dominant factor controlling Ra mobility in Sinai groundwater. Radium activities in central and northern Sinai are generally higher than those in southern Sinai, consistent with a gradual increase in salinity and water-rock interaction with increasing groundwater age. Barite is approximately saturated in the groundwater and may limit maximum dissolved Ra concentration. The results of this study indicate that Sinai groundwater should be used with caution, possibly requiring Ra removal from water produced for domestic and agricultural consumption.",
2815,"Comparison of the abilities of WEPP and the USLE-M to predict event soil loss on steep loessal slopes in China The need to estimate event soil loss better than the USLE and the RUSLE has led to the development of WEPP and the USLE-M, a modification of the USLE that estimates event soil loss for bare fallow runoff and soil loss plots in the USLE database better than the USLE/RUSLE when runoff is known or predicted well. Although the erosivity indices in the USLE-M and the USLE/RUSLE focus on raindrop driven erosion, the calibration of the erodibility index on plots where filling occurs enables the USLE-M and the USLE/RUSLE to be applied on areas where sheet and rill erosion occur. This paper presents results from the application of both WEPP and the USLE-M to modelling event soil loss from 6 runoff and soil plots at the Ansai Research Station of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (36 degrees 56'N, 109 degrees 16'E) produced from steep slopes (8.7%-53.2%) where rills frequently developed under natural rainfall during 1985-1992. WEPP was calibrated to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between measured runoff and predicted runoff for the events where WEPP predicted runoff and soil loss to occur. The number of events where WEPP predicted runoff and soil loss to occur varied from 25% to 41% of events that actually produced soil loss. In the comparison with WEPP, the USLE-M erodibility factor was calibrated by dividing the total observed soil loss where WEPP predicted runoff and soil loss to occur by the total of the USLE-M erosivity factor for the same set of events. Consequently, the total amount of soil lost estimated for these events by both models were the same. This enabled the ability of the models to predict event soil loses to be examined using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index. In every case, the efficiency index values for the USLE-M were higher than for WEPP irrespective of whether the values of USLE-M erosivity index were determined using observed or WEPP predicted runoff. As a model of rainfall erosion, focusing on a process based approach has not resulted in WEPP performing as well as or better than the USLE-M on the steep bare fallow plots of loessal soil at the Ansai Research Station in China.",
2816,"AIR-POLLUTION AND FOREST ECOSYSTEMS - A REGIONAL TO GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of a number of air pollutants over the last century are hallmarks of the magnitude and extent of human impact on the environment. Some of these changes are important to ecologists because many pollutants, acting singly or in combination, affect ecological systems in general and forests in particular. The greatest concern lies with chronic levels of tropospheric ozone, cumulative deposition of hydrogen ion, nitrogen, and sulfur via wet and dry processes, a select number of airborne chemicals (e.g., mercury) that tend to bioaccumulate in continental landscapes, and ultraviolet-B radiation through the loss of stratospheric ozone. Because the atmospheric residence time of most pollutants of concern to ecologists is measured on time frames extending from a few weeks to decades, pollutant distribution and effects are regional to global in dimension. We present evidence that ambient levels of some air pollutants in North America are affecting managed and unmanaged forests, and that the two most important pollutants are tropospheric ozone and chronic nitrogen loading. Further evidence indicates that while concentrations of some air pollutants have been declining over the last decade in North America, others are expected to remain unchanged or increase, including tropospheric ozone. We conclude that air pollution is affecting many North American forests and some remote forests around the globe. In the immediate future, the concern for air pollution effects on forests and associated natural resources will broaden to include interactions with changes in climate and pollution effects in the world's developing countries. There has been a rapid evolution in air pollution studies in ecology, shifting away from the agricultural paradigm of single-factor experimentation toward new methodologies that are ecologically and multidisciplinarily based. This shift has been prompted by the recognition that air pollution is one of several factors influencing forest productivity, community dynamics, and biogeochemistry, and that effects arise through long-term exposures. This evolution in methodologies will become even more marked in the future as new ecological approaches are adopted and an understanding is developed of how air pollution interacts with changes in climate. One of the most promising methodologies is process-level modeling, which utilizes the large base of data in tree physiology and forest ecology, watershed chemistry, and atmosphere-forest canopy meteorology to develop models of tree physiology and growth and to subsequently scale these investigations to the levels of forest stands and landscapes.",
2817,"'Stream Daylighting' as an approach for the renaturalization of riverine systems in urban areas: Istanbul-Ayamama Stream case This paper discusses the interactions between riverine systems and urban areas with a focus on the ecosystem services (ESs) provided by urban rivers and the threats they have been confronting in the urbanization process. Urbanization, as a global demographic trend, led to the increase in migration of people from rural regions to urban areas (especially in developing or under-developed countries) that caused congestion problems in cities with a number of documented effects on urban socio-ecological systems. Due to the urban population increase and expansion of anthropogenic activities, urban riverine systems as one of the most vulnerable components of urban ecology have been exposed to the crisis of ecological deterioration. As a result, their hydro-morphological characteristics changed, crucial functions and aquatic habitats have been lost. From this point of view, Ayamama Stream Watershed is evaluated in the context of the study due to its critical location in Istanbul and a conceptual model framework called 'Co-MISDAL' is developed referring to the 'renaturalization' of buried sections of the river network by using 'Stream Daylighting' method under the key principles of 'Ecohydrology'. Three-stage research methodology is used in the paper and 10 different practices of Stream Daylighting from 4 different regions (USA, Switzerland, Korea, Canada) are comparatively analyzed to develop Co-MISDAL as a guideline for renaturalization of the Ayamama Stream Watershed that is suffering from the extreme flood events and pollution problems. The research mainly aims to evaluate the effectiveness of ecohydrological approach and renaturalization practices for buried and/or damaged urban riverine systems through Stream Daylighting approach.

2818,"Impact of geohydrology and neotectonic activity on radon concentration in groundwater of intermontane Doon Valley, Outer Himalaya, India Radon concentration was measured in 133 water samples from tubewells, handpumps, dug wells and springs of the Doon Valley, Outer Himalaya, India. The observed radon values were found to vary from 10 to 154 Bq/l whereas radium in selected water samples varied from 0.11 to 0.75 Bq/l. Three different clusters of high radon values were observed in the north-western, central and southeastern parts of the Doon Valley. These clusters were found to be associated with tectonics (thrust/fault) and associated uranium mineralization in the area. In general, radon concentration in groundwater was found to be positively correlated with the depth of the wells, whereas no significant correlation was observed between radon concentration in groundwater and the water temperature, pH value, conductivity and altitude of the water samples. An attempt has also been made to determine the nature and extent of aquifers in the Doon Valley on radon concentration in groundwater. The variation in radon concentration within the groundwater of the study area was found to be controlled by the neotectonic activity and geohydrological processes that occur in the area. The impact of these activities on radon concentration in groundwater are discussed.",
2819,"Integrated double mulching practices optimizes soil temperature and improves soil water utilization in arid environments Water shortage threatens agricultural sustainability in many arid and semiarid areas of the world. It is unknown whether improved water conservation practices can be developed to alleviate this issue while increasing crop productivity. In this study, we developed a ""double mulching"" system, i.e., plastic film coupled with straw mulch, integrated together with intensified strip intercropping. We determined (i) the responses of soil evaporation and moisture conservation to the integrated double mulching system and (ii) the change of soil temperature during key plant growth stages under the integrated systems. Experiments were carried out in northwest China in 2009 to 2011. Results show that wheat-maize strip intercropping in combination with plastic film and straw covering on the soil surface increased soil moisture (mm) by an average of 3.8Â % before sowing, 5.3Â % during the wheat and maize co-growth period, 4.4Â % after wheat harvest, and 4.9Â % after maize harvest, compared to conventional practice (control). The double mulching decreased total evapotranspiration of the two intercrops by an average of 4.6Â % (PÂ <Â 0.05), compared to control. An added feature was that the double mulching system decreased soil temperature in the top 10-cm depth by 1.26 to 1.31Â Â°C in the strips of the cool-season wheat, and by 1.31 to 1.51Â Â°C in the strips of the warm-season maize through the 2Â years. Soil temperature of maize strips higher as 1.25 to 1.94Â Â°C than that of wheat strips in the top 10-cm soil depth under intercropping with the double mulching system; especially higher as 1.58 to 2.11Â Â°C under intercropping with the conventional tillage; this allows the two intercrops to grow in a well ""collaborative"" status under the double mulching system during their co-growth period. The improvement of soil moisture and the optimization of soil temperature for the two intercrops allow us to conclude that wheat-maize intensification with the double mulching system can be used as an effective farming model in alleviating water shortage issues experiencing in water shortage areas.",
2820,"Genotoxicity of mercury: contributing for the analysis of Amazonian populations Mercury is an important source of environmental contamination affecting human beings throughout the world and especially in the Amazon. Riverside populations have been chronically exposed to relatively high levels of methylmercury for many years. Long-term effects of mercury exposure are not well known, but human genotoxicity was already showed in both in vitro and epidemiological studies. However, to date, only two studies were carried out in Amazonian populations with conflicting results and without comparing to a non-exposed population. Aiming to highlight this question and avoid interference factors, this work analyzed in vitro genotoxicity of mercury in blood lymphocytes of Amazonian individuals by two methods (micronucleus and chromosomal aberrations). Deleterious effects of low levels (1-500 Î¼g/l or 0,004-2 Î¼M) of methylmercury were only detected with the method to detect chromosomal aberrations. Mitotic index (proportion of cells in metaphase) was the parameter most sensible. Thus, this technique was applied for the analysis of an Amazonian non-exposed population (Panacauera) with similar social-economical characteristics of the exposed populations studied elsewhere. The mean of the mitotic index for Panacauera population was 0.0814 Â± 0.0097. Inter-individual variability of this index had no relation with sex or age. This value was above those registered for some groups of exposed populations. This fact points to mercury as the main responsible for inhibiting the cell cycle and/or the loss of proliferative capacity of the cells. These results already support mitotic index as an essential parameter for the early diagnose of mercury genotoxicity in humans, and especially in Amazonian populations.",
2821,"Studies of High Molybdenum-Induced Copper Deprivation in P. przewalskii on the Qinghai Lake Pasture in China The Przewalski's Gazelles (P. przewalskii) are affected by disorders that are characterized by deprived appetites, pica, emaciation and dyskinesia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of high molybdenum (Mo) in forage leading to copper (Cu) deprivation. The mineral contents in forage, soil, and samples of hair and blood from affected ranges were compared to healthy pasture. Blood parameters were also determined. Our results showed that the mean content of Mo in forage and soil in studied pasture was 5.17 and 4.17 mu g/g, respectively. The Cu to Mo ratio in forage from affected and healthy areas was 1.26 and 5.89 mu g/g, respectively. The Cu concentrations in hair and blood from gazelles in affected pasture were extremely lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected animals. The Mo contents in hair were higher (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles. The levels of Hb, RBC, PCV, MCV, and MCH in unaffected gazelles were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles. The levels of TP, ALB and GLB in blood were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles, while the levels of AST, LDH, CPK and ALP in serum were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles. The activities in serum T-AOC, SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in affected gazelles were extremely lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles, while MDA was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that in unaffected gazelles. Supplementation in copper sulphate (CuSO4) has prevented and cured this disorder. In summary, high molybdenum in feed and soil may lead to secondary Cu deficiency in gazelles, which can be alleviated by supplement of copper sulfate.",
2822,"Differential oxidative stress and DNA damage in rat brain regions and blood following chronic arsenic exposure Chronic arsenic poisoning caused by contaminated drinking water is a wide spread and worldwide problem particularly in India and Bangladesh. One of the possible mechanisms suggested for arsenic toxicity is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The present study was planned 1) to evaluate if chronic exposure to arsenic leads to oxidative stress in blood and brain - parts of male Wistar rats and 2) to evaluate which brain region of the exposed animals was more sensitive to oxidative injury. Male Wistar rats were exposed to arsenic (50A ppm sodium arsenite in drinking water) for 10A months. The brain was dissected into five major parts, pons medulla, corpus striatum, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. A number of biochemical variables indicative of oxidative stress were studied in blood and different brain regions. Single-strand DNA damage using comet assay was also assessed in lymphocytes. We observed a significant increase in blood and brain ROS levels accompanied by the depletion of GSH/GSSG ratio and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity in different brain regions of arsenic-exposed rats. Chronic arsenic exposure also caused significant single-strand DNA damage in lymphocytes as depicted by comet with a tail in arsenic-exposed cells compared with the control cells. On the basis of results, we concluded that the cortex region of the brain was more sensitive to oxidative injury compared with the other regions studied. The present study, thus, leads us to suggest that arsenic induces differential oxidative stress in brain regions with cortex followed by hippocampus and causes single-strand DNA damage in lymphocytes.",
2823,"Evaluating the soil quality of newly created farmland in the hilly and gully region on the Loess Plateau, China In order to better understand the quality of newly created farmland (NF) as well as slope and check-dam farmland (CF) soil quality, two typical traditional farmland areas within the hilly and gully region of Chinese Loess Plateau were selected as controls in this analysis. The results of this study initially reveal that pH values for slope farmland (SF) and CF were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those for NF and that SF values were always greater than those of their CF counterparts. At the same time, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil organic matter (SOM) occurred in the following size-decreasing sequence, i.e., CF, SF, and NF. Data also show that long-term planting has resulted in increases in total nitrogen (N), available N, total phosphorus (P), available P, total potassium (K) and available K and has also enhanced concentrations of soil copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mg) as well as soil cadmium (Ca), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), and mercury (Hg). These latter elements occur in the concentration sequence of SF > CF > NF. Overall, results indicate that long-term planting negatively impacts soil health because of the accumulation of toxic heavy metals. This means that farmland planted over longer timescales needs to lie fallow to enable it to rehabilitate while NF requires the addition of organic matter as well as rotational utilization in order to facilitate the development of green agriculture.",
2824,"Impact of Climate Change on Groundwater Management in the Northwestern Part of Uzbekistan Global climate change can have a significant impact on the development and sustainability of agricultural production. Climate scenarios indicate that an expected increase in air temperature in semiarid Uzbekistan can lead to an increase in evapotranspiration from agricultural fields, an increase in irrigation water requirements, and a deterioration in the ameliorative status of irrigated lands. The long-term mismanagement of irrigation practices and poor conditions of drainage infrastructure have led to an increase in the water table and its salinization level in the northwestern part of Uzbekistan. This article presents the results of an analysis of the amelioration of irrigated lands in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan as well as the modeling of the dynamics of water table depths and salinity levels using the Mann-Kendall trend test and linear regression model. The study estimated the water table depths and salinity dynamics under the impact of climate change during 2020-2050 and 2050-2100. The results show that the water table depths in the region would generally decrease (from 1.72 m in 2050 to 1.77 m by 2100 based on the Mann-Kendall trend test; from 1.75 m in 2050 to 1.79 m by 2100 according to the linear regression model), but its salinity level would increase (from 1.72 g center dot L-1 in 2050 to 1.85 g center dot L-1 by 2100 based on the Mann-Kendall trend test; from 1.97 g center dot L-1 in 2050 to 2.1 g center dot L-1 by 2100 according to the linear regression model). The results of the study provide insights into the groundwater response to climate change and assist authorities in better planning management strategies for the region.",
2825,"Improving the Performance of Photovoltaic by Using Artificial Intelligence Optimization Techniques Photovoltaic (PV) systems are taking a leading role as a solar-based renewable energy source (RES) because of their unique advantages. This trend is being increased in the field of Seawater desalination. This paper presents a study on the Seawater Desalination Plant (SWDP) located in Egypt feeding from the utility network. The main challenge in such a nonlinear system with a high level of variability is the optimum sizing of the SWDP with the proposed whole solar-powered while keeping good dynamic performance. In this article, a solid electrical load analysis is presented to assess the optimal design of SWDP fed by the PV system. Moreover, optimal maximum power point tracking controllers (MPPTCs) are developed to enhance the dynamic performance of SWDP fed by the PV system. To accomplish this study, a real grid connected seawater desalination plant located in Egypt is implemented. The selected SWDP is producing 700 m3/day. The real experimental data of the plant were extracted through daily readings of electricity consumption and water production meters. This experimental data is then introduced to the HOMER program to suggest the optimal components of the PV system based on the minimum net present cost. The developed power plant consists of a Photovoltaic (PV) array, DC/AC converter, load and grid. Also, to tackle the challenge of the low conversion efficiency of the PV system, three MPPTCs are investigated to improve the dynamic performance of the proposed SWDP fed by the PV system. Incremental Conductance in conjunction with three artificial intelligence (AI) optimization techniques (Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Harris Hawks Optimization) is developed for the assessment of the dynamic performance of the presented SWDP fed by PV. The system was constructed, modeled and simulated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The attained results of the three methods are promising in extracting the maximum power with minimum error from the PV system while improving the performance of SWDP. The obtained simulation, as well as experimental results, proves the efficacy of the suggested optimal design strategy.",
2826,"Pedogenesis of bleached topsoils occurring on weakly structured, high chroma subsoils in South Africa Topsoil bleaching is a common occurrence in South African soils. Bleaching is usually associated with the removal of soil pigmenting agents through redox stripping, clay eluviation and/or podzolisation. Thus topsoil bleaching above non-podzolic, high chroma red and yellow, supposedly well-drained subsoils is difficult to explain. These deep, weakly structured, red and yellow subsoils are some of the best agricultural soils in the country, and when climate allows, are farmed intensively. Bleached topsoils are known for their unfavourable physical characteristics, therefore understanding how these soils form is important to guide their taxonomic discrimination so that they can be managed sustainably. Profiles showing bleached and non-bleached (high chroma) topsoils were sampled from two different geographical regions; the summer rainfall eastern Highveld region and the winter rainfall, Western Cape Boland region. These samples were statistically compared to identify differences between bleached and non-bleached variants. Topsoil bleaching was shown to be hydrologically driven in catenal sequences in the summer rainfall region. In the red yellow grey topographic sequence, subsoil colour changes lag behind topsoil colour changes resulting in a zone where bleached topsoils overly high chroma yellow subsoils. The significantly higher (p = 0.05) acid oxalate/citrate dithionite bicarbonate Fe ratio (Far) in bleached topsoils adds further evidence to a redox driven system. Bleached profiles from the Highveld show indicators of increased subsoil clay accumulation, but it is proposed this is not a dominant process and is likely to be a result rather than the cause of bleaching. Bleaching mechanisms in the Western Cape are harder to establish. Only water dispersible clay differs significantly (p = 0.01) between bleached and non-bleached variants. Extractable Fe fractions do not provide significant evidence of redox pathways, although Far is slightly higher in bleached topsoils, despite a lower absolute oxalate extractable Fe concentration. Although not significant (p = 0.11), exchangeable Na, is higher in the bleached profiles and this may account for the more dispersible nature of the bleached profiles. These results suggest that topsoil bleaching in the Western Cape red apedal soils should be used as an indicator for poor structural stability and that these soils require more stringent management to prevent degradation.",
2827,"Quantitative mapping of groundwater depletion at the water management scale using a combined GRACE/InSAR approach GRACE gravity variation recovery and InSAR-derived ground displacement data show promise in supporting and assessing groundwater management policies. However, GRACE system's resolution is too low, and the inversion of InSAR data into volume of groundwater storage loss requires extensive and often unavailable lithological data. Here we present how InSAR can be used to constrain and spatially focus GRACE-derived groundwater mass loss to depletion areas, reducing the gap between the GRACE scale and the typical water management scales. While we highlight the tremendous potential of a fully geodetic, quantitative, and high resolution mapping of groundwater storage loss, we also point out the crucial need for producing guidelines on the proper GRACE solution to use for any study area and/or application. In order to illustrate the GRACE/InSAR combination procedure, we present a case study in Central Mexico, where groundwater depletion of similar to 5000 Million Cubic Meters per year (MCM/yr) is reported by the water governance agencies and is well documented in the scientific literature. However, in this region, not all GRACE solutions provide reasonable groundwater depletion estimates. Using two of them, an inversion is performed to focus the groundwater-related GRACE signal over different mass distribution maps. Several mass distributions are tested, including two from InSAR-derived aquifer compaction mapping. The results show that the regions of Mexico City and Bajio, an agricultural and industrial corridor 250 km North of Mexico City, are the main contributors to the regional groundwater depletion. The mass distribution map produced directly from InSAR leads to results closer to official groundwater budgets than the others tested.",
2828,"Quality of the groundwater of the Serra Geral Aquifer System of Santa Catarina west region, Brazil The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of groundwater located in the west of Santa Catarina state, at Serra Geral Aquifer System (SGAS). It was selected 100 deep tubular wells distributed in urban and rural areas. 300 wells samples were collected at three different periods (march, september and november of 2014), which were submitted to heavy metal analysis (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb and Zn), nitrogen compounds (NO2-, NO3- e NH4+), pH, electrical conductivity, and turbidity. The results showed high levels of Fe and Mn, 31% and 85%, respectively, with not agreement with Brazil Ministry of Health Decree 2.914 of 2011 for human consumption. For the Cd, Cu, Mg, Pb, Zn analysis and nitrogen compound the results obtained agreed with the levels established in the current Brazilian legislation. On the other hand, for Cu, NO2- e NO3- analysis, it was observed the relation between sample and soil occupation, where high metal presence was observed in the urban perimeter, showing the relation with human occupation (population density in urban and rural areas). The influence of the geological formation in the presence of metals (Fe, Mg and Mn) in the groundwater of the study region was also observed.",
2829,"Efficacy of copper-silver ionization for the disinfection of drinking water in Tumbes, Peru High quality is recommended for drinking water to prevent the transportation of pathogenic bacteria. To ensure its quality, different technologies are applied, and copper-silver ionization is used to maintain the microbiological quality. However, considering that the characteristics of this source vary in different scenarios, it was proposed to evaluate the efficacy of copper-silver ionization for the disinfection of drinking water in Tumbes, Peru. For this evaluation, the physicochemical and microbiological parameters of drinking water were tested at different lengths of copper-silver ionization treatment (10, 20 and 30 minutes). Water samples were collected from 20 houses located in urban areas of Tumbes city where Cu-Ag ionizers (Necon GmbH) were installed. The application of Cu-Ag ionization reduced the microbiological load in the water samples, keeping them below the Peruvian permissible limits (mesophilic bacteria < 500 CFU/100 mL and coliforms < 0 CFU/100 mL). However, in samples with a high microbial load and high electrical conductivity, the microbial load was not completely diminished. Cu-Ag ionization considerably improved the microbiological quality of the water, but some physical parameters, such as pH and electrical conductivity, must be taken into account to further improve the results.",
2830,"Impact of heavy metals on inhibitory concentration of Escherichia coli-a case study of river Yamuna system, Delhi, India The occurrence of resistant bacteria to specific heavy metals can be associated with increasing load of the metals in the environment. River Yamuna is polluted by various toxic heavy metals discharged by several industrial and agricultural sources. Therefore, the use of heavy metal-resistant bacteria as an indicator of metal pollution was tested in the present study. For the purpose of the study, the heavy metal resistance status of 42 Escherichia coli strains isolated from River Yamuna water from 7 sampling sites within a span of 2Â years was determined using growth curves and plate dilution method in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values by comparing with MIC value of control strain. Seasonally, the lowest mean MIC value was observed for bacterial strains isolated in post-monsoon (December) 2013 and highest mean MIC value was observed for bacterial strains isolated in monsoon (August) 2015. Site-wise analysis of the maximum mean MIC values for all the isolated strains showed the highest mean Ni MIC value for the bacterial strains isolated from site S4 (ITO), highest mean Cu MIC, Cr MIC, and Fe MIC values for the bacterial strains isolated from site S2 (Najafgarh drain intermixing zone) and highest mean Cd MIC, Pb MIC, and Zn MIC values for the bacterial strains isolated from site S7 (Shahdara drain intermixing zone). Correlation analysis between mean MIC site-wise results with mean heavy metal site-wise concentrations showed significant positive correlation indicating that the higher the mean concentration of a given heavy metal at a given site, the higher the mean MIC value for the strains isolated from the same site indicating higher level of resistance. Overall, the present study has shown that the presence of heavy metals in River Yamuna caused due to indiscriminate discharge of various effluents from different kind of sources as well as due to insufficient treatment capacity of sewage treatment plants as well as common effluent treatment plants, has serious impacts on its bacterial microflora as it leads to the development of resistant strains.",
2831,"Bio-optical response of surface waters to wind-induced upwelling off the Kanyakumari coast This paper investigates the impact of wind-induced coastal upwelling on bio-optical properties over waters off the Kanyakumari coast for two consecutive winters (October 2011 to March 2012 and October 2012 to March 2013). Level-2 wind datasets from Oceansat-2 Scatterometer (12.5 km) have been used to estimate rate of up welling using a published approach. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on-board Aqua and Terra space-platform has been used to obtain bio-optical datasets (level-3, 4 km) that include chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration, absorption due to phytoplankton at 443 nm (aph_443), absorption due to detritus and gelbstoff at 443 rim (adg_443) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at multiple wavelengths. Wind speed resulting in upwelling is found to be in range of 6.95 m s(-1)-18.67 m s(-1). Phytoplankton bloom occurs when upwelling intensity is ranging between approximately 0.90 m/day -3.50 m/day at a lag of about 2-3 days. Chl-a, aph_443, adg_443 and POC concentrations show simultaneous increment after upwelling and Chl-a is found to be the major parameter controlling other bio-optical properties of the study region. The waters belong to Case-1 type mainly co-dominated by phytoplankton and CDOM with very low concentrations of suspended particulate matter. Additionally, a noticeable drop in SST ranging between 0.55 degrees C to 1.50 degrees C has been observed at the same day of upwelling when upwelling intensity is around 1.5 m/day or above.",
2832,"The oxidative and neurotoxic potentials of the ambient PM(2.5) extracts: The efficient multi-solvent extraction method The health effects of ambient air particulate matter with a diameter of â‰¤2.5 Î¼m (PM(2.5)) on the central nervous system are well known and the induced oxidative stress has been shown as their main neuropathologic outcome. Ambient air PM(2.5) sampling methods mostly use air sampler systems that collect PM(2.5) on filters, which is followed by a PM(2.5) extraction approach. Inefficient extraction may lead to compositional bias and unreal interpretation of the results. This study aimed to compare our proposed multi-solvent extraction (MSE) approach for PM(2.5) extraction with a conventional aqueous extraction (AqE) method using the analysis of oxidative effects and cytotoxicity in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Ambient PM(2.5) samples were collected from an urban traffic location in Tehran city, the capital of Iran, using a high-volume sampler. The developed MSE method was proved to have superior advantages over the AqE method including an increased extraction efficiency (as much as 96 against 48% for PM(ms) and PM(aq), respectively), and decreased artifacts and compositional biases. Ambient PM(2.5), besides PM(ms) and PM(aq) were analyzed for water-soluble ions, metals, and major elements. Dithiothreitol, ascorbic acid, lipid peroxidation, and cell viability assays on SH-SY5Y cells represented the significantly higher oxidative potential for PM(ms) compared to PM(aq). The increased cytotoxicity may occur because of the increased oxidative potential of PM(ms) and possibly is associated with higher efficiency of the MSE over the AqE method for removal of total redox-active PM components.",
2833,"Hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater from semiarid region of western India for drinking and agricultural purposes with special reference to water quality index and potential health risks assessment Increase in demand for water for domestic, agricultural and industrial needs has led to overexploitation as well as contamination; hence, it is unremittingly important to monitor and maintain the health of waters. In view of this, a study was carried out wherein a total of 57 groundwater samples from Upper Bhima Basin of western India were collected and analysed for understanding the drinking and agricultural suitability with special reference to water quality index and potential health risks assessment. Analysed physicochemical parameters indicated that the groundwater quality is not suitable in most of the villages for drinking and agricultural purposes. However, pH, TDS, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl(-)and F(-)parameters were below the permissible limit; conversely, Ca2+, Na+, Mg(2+,)and NO(3)(-)contents have been found more than the Indian standards (BIS). The dissemination of ions in the qualitative analysis revealed the dominance order as Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K(+)and HCO3- > SO42-- > Cl- > NO3-. Using Piper's diagram, the groundwater types were found to be majorly Ca2+-HCO3-, Ca2+-Na+-HCO3_, Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl(-)and Ca2+-Cl(-)groups. From the Gibbs plot, it is observed that the samples fall between rock dominance and evaporation dominance zones. Based on irrigation indices such as permeability index, residual sodium carbonate, the groundwater is unsuitable for irrigation. In addition to that, water quality index values revealed that 49% of water samples are found unfit for drinking. Further, health risk assessment study carried out using United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) guidelines showed that children are at higher health risk than men and women in the study region.",
2834,"DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE EVALUTION OF SOLAR ASSISTED MILK PASTEURIZER BY USING VACUUM TUBE COLLECTOR Raw Milk is considered as a tremendous medium for contagious growth of bacteria's and other pathogens which soon get accelerate when stored at ambient temperature. Pakistan is at 3rd place in worldwide milk production. Here about 41.6 million ton of milk is being produced annually from which only 5% get processed and pasteurized hardly and remaining proportion of milk is handled by milk man under non-hygienic conditions which causes diseases. Dairy processing is a rapid growing business but high operational cost is a serious problem. The solar energy in combination with vacuum tube collector having 200 litres capacity and 2.088 m(2) collector area is an efficient way of pasteurizing the milk Steam is used to pasteurize the milk stored in stainless steel tanks Milk is heated up-to 63 degrees C temperature in 30 minutes, then cooled down to 30 degrees C through heat exchanger by using natural tap water. Furthermore, milk is cooled down to 4 degrees C in the chiller within 90 minutes which is powered by 2 kW Photovoltaic system. Rotary compressor was used in the chiller which reduces shunt load. Torque load is zero by applying invertor technology in chiller. Efficiency of the unit was achieved up-to 69%. The payback period of this unit is 3.8 years and processing cost occur 1.8 PKR per litre. This research study is conducted to prolong the shelf life of milk and results as the most excellent and economical way of preserving milk through this solar energy resource technique.",
2835,"Sources and mass fluxes of the main contaminants in a heavily polluted and modified river of the North China Plain Many rivers in China and other newly industrialized countries have suffered from severe degradation of water quality in the context of rapid economic growth. An accounting method was developed to investigate the source and mass fluxes of the main contaminants in the Ziya River, a severely polluted and heavily modified river in a semiarid area of the North China Plain, where chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) were the most important indicators of pollution. The results showed that the urban sewage with high concentration of COD and NH4-N dominated the streams, contributing to 80.7Â % of the streamflow, 92.2Â % of COD, and 94.5Â % of NH4-N. The concentrations of COD and NH4-N in streams varied from 24.0-195.0 to 5.8-43.8Â mg/L, respectively. Mass fluxes of COD and NH4-N of all pathways were quantified. Much of the polluted water was diverted to irrigation, and some eventually flowed into the Bohai Sea. Installation of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and making strict discharge standards can help improve the water quality. Our findings imply that a simple accounting method provides an extremely well-documented example for load estimation and can be useful for intervention strategies in heavily polluted and modified rivers in newly industrialized countries.",
2836,"Conflicts about water in Lake Chad: Are environmental, vulnerability and security issues linked? This article builds on the growing literature that explores the relationships between environmental change and non-traditional security, defined as non-military threats that challenge the survival and well-being of peoples and states. The Lake Chad basin in Africa is used as a case study for analysis. Focusing on a set of questions that have dominated recent theoretical debates, this article investigates whether conflicts resulting from water scarcity are as much about the broader vulnerability of the Lake Chad region as they are about changes in the lake system and its environment. It argues that conflict is a probable outcome only in locations that are already challenged by a multitude of other context-specific factors besides resource scarcity. In the Lake Chad context, the likelihood of scarcity-driven conflict depends on whether vulnerability increases or decreases in the face of a declining water supply. The article provides perspectives for a nuanced understanding of how the receding Lake Chad has led to conflict and outlines an integrated, forward-looking research agenda for linking environmental change, vulnerability and security issues in integrated human-environment systems.",
2837,"Colonial names of countries in Africa before and after uhuru This article investigates the most important general motives for name changing with toponymical changes being viewed as an ideological act by those invested with power to change a specific status quo in order to assert authority, legitimacy and self-esteem. Various concepts are touched upon: colonialism, imperialism, exploitation, anti-colonialism, decolonization and uhuru, the African word for freedom. During the period of decolonization this call for the shaking off of colonial oppression through the achievement of national independence echoed throughout the Continent. After decolonization and as black governments progressed, more patriotic symbols and ceremonies made their appearance to establish the importance of African heroism and noble deeds. After decolonization words like liberation and democracy, transformation, racism, divisive past became prevalent. The feeling among blacks was one of ""centuries of wrong"" during which the voice of Africans was silenced and trampled upon while they were treated as nothing more than colonized peoples. The central issue became the repressive colonial heritage and its detrimental effects on African identities. Africa had to be freed from the odour of its colonial past and what better place to start than reclaiming the African names of countries? The traces of colonialism had to be removed and the suppressed Africans healed by rethinking and repossessing the names of their countries. One of the questions that presents itself is the destabilizing effect of the European ""scramble for Africa"" when the Continent was carved up into political territories during the Berlin Conference in 1884-5. Britain and France acquired the largest possessions, but Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium all took possession of regions in Africa. What becomes clear is that colonialism had a destabilizing influence on many ethnic groups. All this led to the disturbance of the local balances of power and ethnic separations where previously they did not exist and it also resulted in fierce enmity between African ethnic groups such as Ruanda, for example. An important strand is the call for uhuru and the development of an ethos of Afro-centrism which was reflected in the riddance of the so-called ""colonial hangovers"" and the changing of the names of places, towns and cities, leaders and events in truly national terms. More than hundred decolonized states made their appearance worldwide after 1945 when Western actions and views on the history and culture of subservient peoples were seriously questioned Black states wished to redeem their self-respect through reinstating the original names given by the inhabitants to African areas and countries. The manifold colonial name changes of geographical areas and countries are discussed such as the present Democratic Republic of the Congo, the name of which was changed no fewer than nine times, and the Kingdom of Benin, which changed names five times. It appears that personal craving for power ethnic conflict and political faction differences became the driving force for manifold name changes. A full list is given of the countries of which the names were changed after colonial occupation, the year of their independence as well as their present name. In conclusion, the nature and origin of the twenty six African land names re-instituted after Uhuru are discussed in terms of the topography of the particular area especially the presence of water: Zambia (the Zambesi river), Chad (lake ""Tsade'), Malawi (lake ""Malawi'), Togo (from the Ewe name for water ""to"" and beach ""go""); references to kings and kingdoms (Ethiopia from ""Ityopp"", the founder of the city of Actum), Mali (from an antique Islamic kingdom), Mozambique (from the name of a sultan Musa Ben Mbiki); ethnicity (Equatorial Guinea from the Berber word ""gnawa ""for black man), Mauritania (from the Spanish word for Moor), Guinea Bissau (from the Berber equivalent for country of the blacks, ""Akal-n-iguinawen""), Botswana (after the country inhabitants, the Tswana).",
2838,"A multiobjective discrete stochastic optimization approach to shared aquifer management: Methodology and application [1] Negative effects from groundwater mining are observed globally. They threaten future supply locally. Especially in semiarid to arid regions, where aquifers are the sole freshwater resource, this is problematic and can lead to an excessive rise of provision costs. Proper resource management in such environments is crucial. In many instances, however, aquifers are common property resources. In such cases and depending on resource characteristics and the nature of competing uses, their management is inherently multiobjective, and benefits from cooperative management are likely to be substantial. This paper presents a methodology for the determination of optimal, cooperative allocation policies in multiobjective aquifer management problems. Our model couples a finite difference aquifer model with an economic model that accounts for water provision costs. Discounted temporal installation and pumping and conveyance costs determine the vector-valued objective function. Each of the objectives characterizes the individual present costs over a given time horizon that the corresponding decision makers wish to minimize. Constraint handling is implemented by the option of moving wells. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is coupled to the management model so as to approximate cooperative tradeoff policies on the Pareto surface. These solutions can be ranked against existing, noncooperative status quo strategies. Consequently, the simulation-optimization model is applied to the northwest Sahara aquifer system which is used noncooperatively as a resource by Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. We find that significant capital gains can be achieved by the establishment of intelligent pump scheduling. Since each country could benefit, a strong incentive toward the implementation of such cooperative strategies exists.",
2839,"Biodegradation of mixed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by pure and mixed cultures of biosurfactant producing thermophilic and thermo-tolerant bacteria Applicability of thermophilic and thermo-tolerant microorganisms for biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with low water solubility is an interesting strategy for improving the biodegradation efficiency. In this study, we evaluated utility of thermophilic and thermo-tolerant bacteria isolated from Unkeshwar hot spring (India) for biodegradation of four different PAHs. Water samples were enriched in mineral salt medium (MSM) containing a mixture of four PAHs compounds (anthracene: ANT, fluorene: FLU, phenanthrene: PHE and pyrene: PYR) at 37â€¯Â°C and 50â€¯Â°C. After growth based screening, four potent strains obtained which were identified as Aeribacillus pallidus (UCPS2), Bacillus axarquiensis (UCPD1), Bacillus siamensis (GHP76) and Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (U277) based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Degradation of mixed PAH compounds was evaluated by pure as well as mixed cultures under shake flask conditions using MSM supplemented with 200â€¯mg/L concentration of PAHs (50â€¯mg/L of each compound) for 15â€¯days at 37â€¯Â°C and 50â€¯Â°C. A relatively higher degradation of ANT (92%- 96%), FLU (83% - 86%), PHE (16% - 54%) and PYR (51% - 71%) was achieved at 50â€¯Â°C by Aeribacillus sp. (UCPS2) and mixed culture. Furthermore, crude oil was used as a substrate to study the degradation of same PAHs using these organisms which also revealed with similar results with the higher degradation at 50â€¯Â°C. Interestingly, PAH-degrading strains were also positive for biosurfactant production. Biosurfactants were identified as the variants of surfactins (lipopeptide biosurfactants) based on analytical tools and phylogenetic analysis of the surfactin genes. Overall, this study has shown that hot spring microbes may have a potential for PAHs degradation and also biosurfactant production at a higher temperature, which could provide a novel perspective for removal of PAHs residues from oil contaminated sites.",
2840,"The SaniPath Exposure Assessment Tool: A quantitative approach for assessing exposure to fecal contamination through multiple pathways in low resource urban settlements Inadequate sanitation can lead to exposure to fecal contamination through multiple environmental pathways and can result in adverse health outcomes. By understanding the relative importance of multiple exposure pathways, sanitation interventions can be tailored to those pathways with greatest potential public health impact. The SaniPath Exposure Assessment Tool allows users to identify and quantify human exposure to fecal contamination in low-resource urban settings through a systematic yet customizable process. The Tool includes: a project management platform; mobile data collection and a data repository; protocols for primary data collection; and automated exposure assessment analysis. The data collection protocols detail the process of conducting behavioral surveys with households, school children, and community groups to quantify contact with fecal exposure pathways and of collecting and analyzing environmental samples for E. coli as an indicator of fecal contamination. Bayesian analyses are used to estimate the percentage of the population exposed and the mean dose of fecal exposure from microbiological and behavioral data. Fecal exposure from nine pathways (drinking water, bathing water, surface water, ocean water, open drains, floodwater, raw produce, street food, and public or shared toilets) can be compared through a common metric-estimated ingestion of E. coli units (MPN or CFU) per month. The Tool generates data visualizations and recommendations for interventions designed for both scientific and lay audiences. When piloted in Accra, Ghana, the results of the Tool were comparable with that of an in-depth study conducted in the same neighborhoods and highlighted consumption of raw produce as a dominant exposure pathway. The Tool has been deployed in nine cities to date, and the results are being used by local authorities to design and prioritize programming and policy. The SaniPath Tool is a novel approach to support public-health evidence-based decision-making for urban sanitation policies and investments.",
2841,"Comparison of Blood Lead Concentrations in Mothers of Children with Congenital Heart Disease and Mothers of Healthy Children Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent congenital defect that causes several problems for patients and their families and medical specialists. It is important to investigate CHD risk factors due to their significantly destructive load on society. This study aims to determine the association between maternal lead exposure and conceiving a child with CHD. This case-control study was performed on a total of 246 mothers in the pediatric clinic of Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Birjand, Iran. One hundred forty-six mothers with CHD children were defined as the case group, and 100 age-matched mothers with healthy children were considered the control group. All the mothers were between 20 and 40 years old, and their children were under the age of 6 months. Demographic data was collected from mothers using a well-designed questionnaire. In addition, all mothers were referred to the laboratory for measuring blood lead concentrations. The mean blood lead concentration (BLC) of mothers in the group of children with heart problems was 4.11 +/- 10.02 with a median of 2.50 mu g/dL and in the control group was 2.66 +/- 2.06 with a median of 2.30 mu g/dL. The Mann-Whitney test results showed that mothers' lead concentration in the group of children with heart problems was significantly higher than the control group (z = 2.13, p = 0.03). The chi-square test results showed that lead concentrations in the two groups were significantly different from each other (chi(2) = 9.11, p = 0.01). The results of our study showed that mothers of children with CHD had higher blood concentrations than mothers of healthy children.",
2842,"The effects of weathering on the UG2 Chromitite reef of the Bushveld Complex, with special reference to the platinum-group minerals Mineralogical examination of borehole core from the weathered zone of the UG2 Chromitite reef at the Union Section of AMPLATS in the northwestern Bushveld Complex, South Africa, reveals that the mineralogy of the reef has undergone a number of changes. The chromite particles have an outer rim which is cracked and slightly enriched in chromium and depleted in iron compared to the core. The base-metal sulphide (BMS) content of the original unweathered UG2 reef is only trace, but in the weathered zone no residual EMS are present. Chemical analyses of the borehole core indicate that the platinum values do not change with depth. Palladium however shows depletion at the top and enrichment at similar to 25 m, which is near the base of the weathered zone. Microscopic and SEM examination shows that the platinum-group minerals (PGM) in the weathered zone have undergone varying degrees of alteration. Pt-Rh-Cu-S, an unnamed but a common PGM in the UG2, shows distinct alteration characteristics. Where a PGM, usually cooperite (PtS), was observed, it was noticed on the back-scattered electron (BSE) image on the SEM that the nearby silicate was of a higher brightness than expected. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of the silicates reveals a high palladium, and occasionally rhodium, content of these silicates. Also present are significant levels of copper and occasionally nickel and manganese. In two cases 'PGE-oxides' were observed: a Pd-oxide containing Pd-Cu-Fe and a Pt-oxide containing Pt-Mn-Ni.",
2843,"The Adsorptive Removal of Fluoride from Aqueous Solution by Modified Sludge: Optimization Using Response Surface Methodology The sludge from the water supply plant was investigated to remove fluoride ions from the water. To improve the adsorption ability, the original sludge sample was treated with fuel oxidation, pyrolysis, hydrochloric acid, and sulphuric acid methods, and hydrochloric acid treatment improved the adsorption capacity of the sludge on the fluoride in water significantly, with a maximum adsorption capacity to 140 mg/kg. The adsorption experimental data was the well fitted pseudo-first-order model and the Langmuir isotherms model. SEM images and XRD patterns of the adsorbent were recorded to get a better insight into the adsorption process. The effect of three variables, hydrochloric acid treated sludge (HWS) dose, pH, and initial fluoride concentration were studied using a Box-Behnken statistical experimental design. The model of the adsorption and optimum conditions was investigated using the response surface methodology. The optimum removal efficiency of fluoride can reach 81.153% under the optimum condition: HWS dose of 14.10 g/L and pH value at 6.12. The effect of co-existing anions and the removal efficiency from the water were also studied. The results suggest that sludge from the water supply plant can be reused as a coagulant for the removal of fluoride from poor quality water.",
2844,"Petrogenesis of the Rio Blanco epithermal Au-Ag mineralization in the Cordillera Occidental of southwestern Ecuador: Assessment from host rocks petrochemistry and ore constituents isotopic (O, S, H, and Pb) compositions The petrogenesis of the Rio Blanco Au-Ag mineralization in the Cordillera Occidental (Western Cordillera), southwest Ecuador, was assessed using magmatic host rocks and ore constituents geochemical and isotopic (S, O, H, Pb and Sr) composition. The magmatic rocks spatially associated with the Rio Blanco Au-Ag mineralization are of arc affinity and mostly include lava flows of andesitic composition, as well as plutons and pyroclastic falls that range from dioritic (andesitic) to granodioritic (dacitic) compositions. These arc rocks as evidenced by their initial Sr isotope compositions ( Sr-87/Sr-86 (i): 0.70443-070694), which are symptomatic of crustal contamination, are of two contrasting magmatic suites (transitional and calc-alkaline), and typically display enrichment in LREE with respect to HREE, with resulting moderately elevated La/Yb ratios of 5.75-8.79. Unlike parental melts of most Miocene intrusions associated with porphyry-related mineralization from the Cordillera Occidental of Ecuador, which differentiated at a deep crustal level, the Rio Blanco parental magma, which was generated in a relatively thin crustal setting (as suggested by Sr/Y ratios) differentiated in the upper crust (as supported by the relatively low Sr/Y) at < 0.4 GPa, where significant plagioclase fractionation took place as evidenced by their consistent negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* ranges from 0.065 to 0.102), as well as the positive correlation between Sr/Y and Eu/Eu*. Important plagioclase fractionation was accompanied by minor amphibole and pyroxene fractionation as evidenced by their sporadic occurrence as phenocrysts in Rio Blanco magmatic rocks under investigation. Magmatic rocks spatially associated with the Rio Blanco Au-Ag mineralization also show a significant radiogenic signature, which was acquired through assimilation of various basement rocks within the upper crust, thus leading to heterogeneous and wide Pb isotopic composition ranges (Pb-206/(204)Pbi = 18.605-19.174; 207Pb/ 204Pbi = 15.621-15701; Pb-208/(204)Pbi = 38.442-39.043). Sulfides and electrum are radiogenic as well (Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios are between 19.002 and 19.143, whereas Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios span from 15.644 to 15.697 and from 38.827 to 38.998, respectively) and overlap the compositions of the highly radiogenic magmatic rocks, indicating Pb and by inference, the other metals such as Au and Ag are of magmatic origin like S, which delta S-34 (V-CDT) values range between -3 and 4.9 parts per thousand. Unlike S and metals of magmatic origin, the degased (as indicted by delta D (V-SMOW) values range between - 92.54 and - 78.89 parts per thousand) mineralizing H2O is a mixture between magmatic and meteoric fluids as supported by their delta O-18 (V-SMOW) values ranging from -0.959-4.21 parts per thousand.",
2845,"Chronic arsenic exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes in bangladesh BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to arsenic through drinking water has the potential to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes, although the association has not been demonstrated conclusively. This cross-sectional study assessed the association between arsenic in drinking water and spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 533 women were interviewed. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, drinking water use, and adverse pregnancy outcomes was obtained through a structured pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. The respondents reported use of a total of 223 tube wells; for 208 wells, water samples were measured using an ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry method, whereas 15 were measured by flow-injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FIHG-AAS). RESULTS: Excess risks for spontaneous abortion and stillbirth were observed among the participants chronically exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic in drinking water after adjusting for participant's height, history of hypertension and diabetes, and (for neonatal death only) age at first pregnancy. Comparing exposure to arsenic concentration of greater than 50 microg/L with 50 microg/L or less, the odds ratios were 2.5 (95% confidence interval=1.5-4.3) for spontaneous abortion, 2.5 (1.3-4.9) for stillbirth, and 1.8 (0.9-3.6) for neonatal death. CONCLUSIONS: These study findings suggest that chronic arsenic exposure may increase the risk of fetal and infant death.",
2846,"Regulating sewage pollution of Malaysian rivers and its challenges While sewage pollution is considered as an old problem which developed nations have already managed effectively, missing all too often in developing countries are the resources to come up with practical solution and the necessary political and legal infrastructure to support these solutions as well as the community awareness required to address the problem. Many Malaysian rivers continue to suffer from sewage pollution. This paper provided concise exposition the regulatory framework of sewage pollution control of inland surface waters under the country's existing primary federal environmental legislation. The paper then discussed regulators' perceptions on the main causes that lead to the recurring sewage pollution problem in Malaysian rivers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face with key informants from several relevant government bodies. They highlighted a mixture of causes to the recurring problem of sewage pollution in our rivers including insufficiency of the law and its implementation, outdated technology as well as lack of public awareness. This research gathers essential views from different authorities that can be of use by policy-makers in the efforts of improving the existing situation of sewage pollution problem in the country.

2847,"Investigating Trends in Streamflow and Precipitation in Huangfuchuan Basin with Wavelet Analysis and the Mann-Kendall Test This study aims to investigate trends in streamflow and precipitation in the period 1954-2010 in a semiarid region of the Yellow River watershed, Huangfuchuan basin, China. The combination of the wavelet transform and different Mann-Kendall (MK) tests were employed to figure out the basic trends structure in streamflow and precipitation and what time scales are affecting the observed trends. The comparative analysis with five MK test methods showed that the modified MK tests with full serial correlation structure performed better when significant autocorrelations exhibited for more than one lag. Three criteria were used to determine the optimal smooth mother wavelet, the decomposition level and the extension mode used in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) procedure. The first criteria referred to the relative error of the wavelet approximated component and the original series. The second one was the relative error of MK Z-values of approximation component and the original series. Additionally, a new criterion (Er), based on the relative error of energy between the approximate component and the original series, was proposed in this study, with better performance than the previous two criteria. Further, a new powerful index, the energy of the hydrological time series, was proposed to verify the dominant periodic components for the observed trends. The analysis indicated that all monthly, seasonal and annual streamflow showed significant decreasing trends, while no significant trends were found in precipitation. Results from the DWT and MK tests revealed that the main factors influencing the trends in the monthly and seasonal series in Huangfuchuan watershed are intra-annual cycles, while the leading factors affecting the trends in the annual series are decadal events. Different driving factors (e.g., seasonal cycles, solar activities, etc.) related to the periodicities identified in these data types resulted in this discrepancy.",
2848,"Extra and Intercellular Concentrations of Water Soluble Cations from Xanthoria parietina and Phaeophyscia orbicularis Lichenized Fungi Species The aim of the present study was to determine concentrations of the water soluble content of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), ammonium (NH4+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) cations accumulated in the extra and intercellular locations of Xanthoria parietina and Phaeophyscia orbicularis lichenized fungi thallus collected in the north-eastern Romania. The concentrations of the interest cations were determined by ion chromatography. An increase of electrolyte leakage, especially K+, was observed in both Xanthoria parietina and Phaeophyscia orbicularis species, which might be a result of the cell membranes disruption. The identified and quantified cations did not exhibit well defined trends, but rather showed fluctuations between the investigated species and within the investigated time period. Multivariate statistical tools were used in order to investigate the obtained results. The most significant correlations were observed for the (K+,Mg2+) pair in both Xanthoria parietina and Phaeophyscia orbicularis species, an observation which might suggest either similarities in their locations or possible common physiological role.",
2849,"Hydrogeochemical Characteristics and Quality Assessment of Mine Water in Coalfield Area, Guizhou Province, Southwest China Coal resources are widely distributed in Guizhou province, China and environmental pollution caused by coal mining is becoming increasingly serious, especially mine drainage. A total of 120 mine water samples collected from different coalfields were analyzed to investigate the hydrogeochemical characteristics and assess the water quality for drinking, domestic, and irrigative purposes. Water samples had a pH of 1.90-9.12 and most of them were acidic or weakly acidic. Total dissolved solids (TDS) ranged from 254 to 13,944Â mg/L and correlated closely with the electrical conductivity (EC). The coal mine drainage of Guizhou was characterized typically by low pH value, high Fe and SO(4)(2-) concentration, which were mainly attributed to oxidative weathering of pyrite. The most dominant type for abandoned coal-mine drainage was Ca-Mg-SO(4), while that of the underground drainage for active mine were mainly Na-SO(4) and Na-HCO(3) because of high concentration of Na(+) from the dissolution of evaporites and clastic rocks. High concentration of the TDS, SO(4)(2-), Fe, Mn, et al. made it unsuitable for drinking and domestic use, but part of the coal mine drainage could be used for irrigation at some sites.",
2850,"Evaluation of effectiveness of artificial recharge measures in parts of Maharashtra using environmental isotopes India has good average annual precipitation, but its poor distribution in space and time has led to the scarcity of groundwater in many areas. Artificial recharge to groundwater requires a composite procedure along with detailed morphometric and hydrogeological studies of the area. In Maharashtra State, a programme was initiated to recharge the groundwater by making a cascade of earthen bunds, recharge ponds and using disused open wells. The effectiveness of artificial recharge programmes was evaluated by employing environmental isotopes (H-3, O-18 and D) in Ozar watershed whereas recharge zones and effectiveness of different recharge sources were evaluated in BM-60 and Bamnod watersheds. O-18 and H-3 isotopes revealed that the groundwater storage in Ozar watershed remains less and the contribution of canal water was found minimum during July and maximum during October (about 100%). Similarly, the isotopic signatures of groundwater in BM-60 indicate that the precipitation is the main source of recharge to groundwater in the BM-60 watershed and the contribution of other sources is minimal. The higher values of environmental tritium in Bamnod watershed revealed the contribution of artificial recharge that was carried out through Hatnur Canal on casual basis.",
2851,"Investigation of Lead and Iron Removal from Groundwater Using Sapropel and Quartz Sand In Prey Nop district of Cambodia, a district in coastal area, it was observed that concentration of iron and lead in groundwater was higher than permissible values. Lead is a highly toxic heavy metal, while iron is an element causing several problems related to the deterioration of taste and aesthetic appearance of water and the capacity reduction of water supply pipelines. Therefore, this article investigates the effectiveness of the technology for removing lead and iron from groundwater using the cheapest materials like sapropel and sand. In this study, different doses of sapropel (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 g/L), different durations of sorption processes (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min) and a laboratory bench for iron filtration filled with quartz sand were used for lead and iron ions removal. Results from the bench tests showed that both iron and lead were removed at efficiencies of 70 and 97%, and their concentrations did not exceed the permissible levels by using the lowest dose of 0.1 g/L of sapropel for sorption of lead and filtration through quartz sand filters for iron removal.",
2852,"Impact of Climate Change and Land Use on Groundwater Salinization in Southern Bangladesh-Implications for Other Asian Deltas Pervasive salinity in soil and water is affecting agricultural yield and the health of millions of delta dwellers in Asia. This is also being exacerbated by climate change through increases in sea level and tropical storm surges. One consequence of this has been a widespread introduction of salt water shrimp farming. Here, we show, using field data and modeling, how changes in climate and land use are likely to result in increased salinization of shallow groundwater in SE Asian mega-deltas. We also explore possible adaptation options. We find that possible future increase of episodic inundation events, combined with salt water shrimp farming, will cause rapid salinization of groundwater in the region making it less suitable for drinking water and irrigation. However, modified land use and water management practices can mitigate the impacts on groundwater, as well as the overlying soil, from future salinization. The study therefore provides guidance for adaptation planning to reduce future salinization in Asian deltas.",
2853,"Reproductive toxicity assessment of surface water of the Tai section of the Yangtze River, China by in vitro bioassays coupled with chemical analysis Reproductive toxicity of organic extracts of the surface water from the Tai section of the Yangtze River was assessed by in vitro cytotoxity assays and selected persistent organic pollutants including PCBs, OCPs and PAHs were quantified by instrumental analysis. Eleven of the US EPA priority PAHs were detected. Individual PAHs were found to range from 0.7 to 20 ng/L. Concentrations of BaP did not exceed the national drinking water source quality standard of China. However, a 286-fold concentrated organic extract induced significant reproductive toxicity in adult male rats. The morphology of cells, MTT assay and LDH release assay were all affected by exposure to the organic extracts of water. The results of the reproductive toxicity indicated that PAHs posed the greatest risk of the chemicals studied.

It was released into the main source of water supply, Mae Taw River, which also be used for agriculture. This represents a serious problem that should be addressed accordingly. This study aims to investigate the synthesized zeolite from agriculture waste by-product in Thailand such as; rice husk ash (RHA) with white part is containing high silica content which can be used as a potential zeolites precursor and used to solve the problem by removing cadmium in aqueous solution via batch experiments. The removal of Cd2+ in the concentration range of 50-500 mg/L. The maximum removal capacity of synthesized zeolite Na-A and Na-X for Cd2+ were found to be 736.38 and 684.46 mg/g, respectively. The result was compared to synthetic zeolite 3A commercial shown that synthesized zeolites from RHA have high removal capacity close to commercial one of 753.58 mg/g using 0.3 g/L dosage of zeolite and consistent with an endothermic reaction, an increase in the temperature (20-40 degrees C) resulted in increasing cadmium adsorption rate. Therefore, the synthesized zeolites from RHA have high potential to remove cadmium contamination in water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2855,"Mountains of Tajikistan: Problems of sustainable development Almost 93% of Tajikistan's territory consists of mountains which include some of the highest in Central Asia. These are in the Tian Shan and the Pamir-Alay ranges. About half of the country's territory is situated at an elevation above 3000 meters and the difference between minimal and maximal altitudes exceeds 7000 meters. Tajikistan has rich resources of coal, oil, gas, mercury, molybdenum, antimony, tin, gold, silver, phosphorus, salt, talc, asbestos, fluorite, marble, gypsum, clay, precious stones and other minerals. There are more than 400 known deposits of which 70 are being actively exploited. Most of the glaciers in Central Asia are located in Tajikistan. The area occupied by these glaciers is approximately 8470 square kilometres or 6% of the country's territory These glaciers and their associated snowfields are the main water sources for the rivers emptying into the Aral Sea. These rivers are thought of as ""rivers of life"" since they provide populated areas with water for drinking, irrigation and the production of the electricity. There are four main rivers originating in Tajikistan. These are the Syr-Darya in northern Tajikistan, the Zeravshan in central Tajikistan, the Pajn in south-western Tajikistan and Pamir and the Vakhsh. The Panj and the Vakhsh later combine to form the Amu-Darya. In terms of water resources Tajikistan's are the richest in the Central Asia. These resources are used primarily for irrigation as well as for industrial and municipal purposes. The mountain rivers are also used for generating electric power. This situation presents crucial problems for Central Asia because the costs and benefits associated with the use of the mountain resources are unequally shared amongst the countries. The countries of Central Asia can be divided into those which may be considered as water providers, ie. the predominantly mountainous countries of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan and those who are predominantly water users, ie. Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The problems that arise are: decreasing water availability; excessive water use; water versus energy needs pollution; inappropriate agricultural practices; declining forest areas; environmental protection; mining and associated waste disposal; unsustainable use of mountain resources. Our report is devoted to a description of these problems and strategies for dealing with them.",
2856,"Advancements in and Integration of Water, Sanitation, and Solid Waste for Low- And Middle-Income Countries The water, sanitation, and solid waste sectors are closely related and have many interactions between their respective service chains in low- and middle-income countries. Currently, these interactions mostly lead to cross-contamination, and opportunities for co-benefits are seldom realized. This review presents the key advancements within each of these three development sectors in the past two decades. We identify numerous similarities such as decentralization, resource recovery, community involved planning, and digitalization. Despite the potential for synergies and the opportunities to maximize positive interactions, there have been few attempts to break the existing sectoral silos in order to integrate these three service chains. We argue that, with the right enabling environment, an integrated approachto holistically planning and implementing water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management can create positive interactions resulting in co-benefits among complementary development goals.

2857,"Water Quality Assessment of Irrigation and Drainage Systems on the Basis of Phytoplankton Analysis Water systems in Upper Egypt appear to be vulnerable for Egyptians uses and abuses. Recognition of the ever increasing pressure on those resources and the inevitable conflicts of water utility always require promotion of strategies for better environmental management of this valuable resource. WHO has reported that about 40 thousand people worldwide are dying daily due to consumption of polluted water. Hence, it was thought imperative to assess the water quality and pollution status of aquatic habitats in Upper Egypt. Irrigation and drainage canals have an important role in controlling the water balance, for irrigation of agricultural lands and discharge from the cultivated soils. They may be subjected to anthropogenic impact that lead to perceptible changes in their regime particularly in the drainage canals. In such habitats, planktonic algae are sensitive to the dramatic fluctuations of water quality, and are therefore could be regarded as predictors for monitoring environmental conditions. Obvious differences were observed between the irrigation and drainage canals in water quality and phytoplankton abundance as well as its community structure. For instance, the species diversities in the irrigation canals were relatively higher than those in the drainage canals. Furthermore, some euglenoid and cyanoprokaryotic phytoplankton appeared in the drainage canals and completely disappeared in the irrigation canals. These observations provide evidence for possible use of phytoplankton to assess water quality.",
2858,"Incorporation of Phase Change Material (PCM) in Poultry Hatchery for Thermal Management & Energy Conversion Schemes of Slaughterhouse Waste in Broiler Farms for Energy Conservation - A Case Study Energy has become an important and one of the basic infrastructures for economic development of a county. The per capita energy consumption of a country is an index of prosperity. India houses 17% of world population and consumes only 3.3% of total world energy. Currently, energy experts are always analyzing economically feasible and technically viable methods towards the generation and conservation of energy in a friendly nature to the environment. Poultry Industry is the one which consumes more energy and this contributes major share in the broiler production cost and produces huge amount of meat waste which is not utilized much. Hence this sector may possibly be considered for a study towards the energy conservation potential as well as handling the waste to energy conversion process for supporting the environment from pollution. This industry requires two major energies such as thermal and electricity. The poultry based livestock production is increasing day by day which leads to increase in production of poultry meat wastes such as chicken litter and guts. This may results in air, soil and water pollution. One of the promising novel methods is meeting the energy demand from renewable energy sources and by utilizing the pollutant based waste generated from the slaughterhouses. This paper propose the suitability of phase change material (PCM) for solar energy storage which ultimately provides the thermal management process in the poultry egg hatchery and also deals with various possibilities to handle the chicken guts in a most effective way for meeting out the grow-out farms energy demand.",
2859,"ASSESSING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF SMR: AN APPLICATION OF INCAS MODEL TO INDIA Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have the potential to be an important component of the worldwide nuclear renaissance. Whilst requiring more diluted investment than Large Reactors (LRs), SMRs are simpler build and operate as well as being suitable for deployment in harsh environmental conditions. In addition, useful by-products such as desalinated water and process heat are generated. The economic competitiveness of SMRs with respect to LRs must be carefully evaluated since the economies of scale label these reactors as not economically competitive. As such, a variety of financial and economic models have been developed by the scientific community in order to assess the competitiveness of SMRs. One of these, the INCAS model (Integrated model for the Competitiveness Assessment of SMRs), performs an investment project simulation and assessment of SMR and LR deployment scenarios, providing monetary indicators (e.g. IRR, LUEC, total equity invested) and not-monetary indicators (e.g. design robustness, required spinning reserve). The work in this paper investigates the attractiveness of SMRs for a given scenario, the Indian state, through application of the INCAS model. India is the second most populated country in the world with rapid economic growth and a huge requirement for energy. There is also both good public acceptance and political support for nuclear power in India, important factors favoring the deployment SMRs in particular. India seems particularly suitable for SMR deployment because (i) its energy intensive industrial sites are located far from existing grids, (ii) rapid growth in the region and (iii) the requirement for plants to provide fresh water for the population, as well as for agriculture and industry. The results show that SMRs have roughly the same financial performance of LRs, however they have a competitive advantage as a result of non-financial factors such as co-generation application, higher local content and better management of the spinning reserves in a country with an electricity deficit.",
2860,"Water storage variations of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Zhujiang river basins derived from the DEOS Mass Transport (DMT-1) model In general, China is short of water resources and some regions even experience a shortage of daily water supply. This could threaten the stability and economic development of the nation. A study on the water storage variations is especially important for the water management and storage prediction in three largest river basins of China, namely, Yangtze, Yellow, and Zhujiang, where the most dense population and leading economic regions are located. The satellite gravity mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) provides an opportunity to macroscopically identify water (or mass) variations in the Earth's system with a spatial resolution of 300-400 km and a temporal resolution of about one month. We use the first release of the DEOS (Delft Institute of Earth Observation and Space Systems) Mass Transport (DMT-1) model based on GRACE data to analyze water storage changes in the three river basins. The DMT-1 model consists of monthly solutions, which are computed using an innovative methodology. The methodology includes, in particular, the application of a statistically optimal Wiener-type filter based on full variance-covariance matrices of noise and signal. This results in particularly sharp mass variation maps. Taking one monthly solution as an example, we compare the results derived from the DMT-1 model with ones produced with the standard post-processing scheme based on a combination of the de-striping and Gaussian filtering. The comparison shows that the DMT-1 model outperforms the other models and is suitable for the analysis of the mass changes in river basins. A subset of the DMT-1 solutions in the interval between February 2003 and May 2008 is used to estimate the secular trends and seasonal variations for the three river basins. The estimated trends show that the water storage of the Yellow River basin does not have significant changes, while the Zhujiang and Yangtze river basins have a large and statistically significant water storage increase. The estimation of seasonal variations demonstrates that the water storage variations in Yangtze and Zhujiang river basins are almost in the same phase. The amplitude of variations in the Zhujiang River basin is larger than that in Yangtze. No clear annual variations are observed in the Yellow River basin. The observed water storage variations generally coincide with the observations and conclusions presented in the hydrological reports of the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources.",
2861,"ISOTOPIC AND CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION OF WATER AND STEAM DISCHARGES FROM VOLCANIC MAGMATIC HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS OF THE GUANACASTE GEOTHERMAL PROVINCE, COSTA-RICA The Guanacaste Geothermal Province encompasses three major geothermal systems, each centered on its respective volcanic structure: Rincon de la Vieja to the NW, Miravalles in the center and Tenorio to the SE. Each shows corresponding sets of surface manifestations: vapor discharges from fumaroles and steam-heated pools at altitudes >500 m; lower temperature SO4-Cl springs on the lower slopes of the respective volcano; and cooler neutral Cl springs to the S of the volcanic chain, at altitudes <500 m. The production of HCO3-rich waters is limited to a narrow belt stretching to the S of Miravalles volcano. Chemical and isotopic evidence suggests that the neutral Cl waters, also discharged from deep wells, are derived from a more primitive Cl-SO4 water formed by transfer of readily mobilised, originally magmatic constituents to deeply circulating groundwater. Isotopic evidence suggests that this groundwater is derived largely from areas to the north of the volcanic chain. The presence of immature waters within drillable depth is indicated by the incursion of an acid SO4 water into a well at Miravalles after deepening to 2000 m. As the Cl waters rise, they start to boil. The separated vapors feed the fumaroles and steam-heated features at thc surface, the residual water travels underground to be discharged some 5-25 km to the S. The uniformity in chemical and isotopic compositions of the neutral Cl waters is compatible with the assumption that the individual thermal systems are linked at depth to form large, contiguous geothermal reservoirs beneath the Guanacaste Geothermal Province.",
2862,"Developments in multiple-valve water-hammer control This paper investigates multiple-valve closures in a simple reservoir-valve-pipeline-valve system. Multiple closing (or opening) of valves may induce large positive or low negative pressure waves due to wave interference (superposition of the waves). The effect of multiple-valve closure can be either beneficial or detrimental, with the outcome being entirely dependent on the position of the valves and the sequence and delay of the closures. Valves are incorporated as boundary conditions in the method of characteristics model. The staggered (diamond) grid with consideration of unsteady skin friction is applied. Experimental investigations of multiple-valve induced water-hammer have been performed in the University of Montenegro laboratory pipeline apparatus. The apparatus consists of an upstream end high-pressurized tank, horizontal steel pipeline (length 55.37 m, inner diameter 18 mm), four valve units positioned along the pipeline including the end points, and a downstream end tank. The transient event is initiated first by rapid closure of the downstream-end valve followed by the delayed closure of the upstream-end valve. Calculated and measured results are compared and discussed in the light of the effects of pressure wave interference.",
2863,"Reconstructing the historical spatial land use pattern for Jiangsu Province in mid-Qing Dynasty This study is proposed to reconstruct a high-resolution spatial distribution of historical land use pattern with all land use types to overcome low-accuracy and/or the monotonic land use type in current historical land use reconstruction studies. The year of 1820 is set as the temporal section and the administrative area of Jiangsu Province is the study area. Land use types being reconstructed include farmland, residential land (including both urban land and rural residential land), water body, and other land (including forest land, grassland, and unused land). Data sources mainly refer to historical documents, historical geographic research outcomes, contemporary statistics, and natural environmental data. With great considerations over regional natural resources and social and economic conditions, a few theoretical assumptions have been proposed to facilitate the adjustment on prefecture farmland, urban land, and rural residential land. Upholding the idea that the contemporary land use pattern has been inherently in sequence with the historical land use pattern as well as the land use pattern shall be consistent to its accessibility, this study reconstructs the land use pattern in Jiangsu Province in 1820 with 100 m*100 m grids based on accessibility analysis and comprehensive evaluation. The outcome has been tested as valid by regionalization and correlation analysis. The resulted spatial distribution shows that back in 1820 in Jiangsu Province: (1) farmland, urban land, rural residential land, water body, and other land take about 48.49%, 4.46%, 0.16%, 15.03%, and 31.86% of the total land area respectively; (2) the land use pattern features high proportion of land in farming while low-proportion land in non-farming uses while population, topography, and the density of water body lead to great spatial variations; and (3) the reconstruction methodology has been tested as reasonable based on significant positive correlations between 1820 data and 1985 for both farmland and rural residential land at the prefecture level.",
2864,"Scaling-up Studies on Electrolysis Using Cation Exchange Membrane for Alum Recovery Water treatment sludge from coagulation process in Indonesia is generally directly discharged into rivers. This condition may negatively affect the environment and human health. The high concentration of aluminum in the sludge can be potentially recovered as alum coagulant. Laboratory-scale electrolysis using cation exchange membrane (CEM) has proven to increase purity of recovered alum. The use of CEM for alum recovery in a pilot-scale can be used to estimate investment, operation, and maintenance costs in its application. This study aims to examine effectiveness of the pilot-scale electrolysis using CEM for alum recovery from water treatment sludge. The electrolysis cell used plate acrylic material with a batch recirculation reactor system. Feed tank capacity was 5 L with electrolysis cell volume of 400 mL. The cross-sectional area of the electrode was 48 cm(2). The electrolysis was operated for 10 h. The electric currents used in this study were 400, 600, and 800 mA. Conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, aluminum, iron, and manganese were measured every hour, as well as concentrations of zinc, lead, chromium, and copper at the initial and end of electrolysis. Results showed that optimum current density was 12.5 mA/cm(2) with alum recovery efficiency of 68.06% at specific energy consumption of 53.47 kWh/kg. The recovered alum was free from organic impurities, and the main metal component was aluminum with high percentage (91.23%). The electrolysis effectiveness in alum recovery was influenced by the ratio of electrode area and electrolysis cell volume, operation time, and current density.",
2865,"ANALYSIS OF GAS MIGRATION PATTERNS IN FRACTURED COAL ROCKS UNDER ACTUAL MINING CONDITIONS Fracture fields in coal rocks are the main channels for gas seepage, migration, and extraction. The development, evolution, and spatial distribution of fractures in coal rocks directly affect the permeability of the coal rock as well as gas migration and flow In this work, the Ji-15-14120 miningface at the No. 8 Coal Mine of Pingdingshan Tian'an Coal Mining Co. Ltd., Pingdingshan, China, was selected as the test site to develop a full-parameter fracture observation instrument and a dynamic fracture observation technique. The acquired video information of fractures in the walls of the boreholes was vectorized and converted to planarly expanded images on a computer-aided design platform. Based on the relative spatial distances between the openings of the boreholes, simultaneous planar images of isolated fractures in the walls of the bore holes along the mining direction were obtained from the boreholes located at various distances from the mining face. Using this information, a 3-D fracture network under mining conditions was established. The gas migration pattern was calculated using a COMSOL computation platform. The results showed that between 10 hours and 1 day the fracture network controlled the gas-flow, rather than the coal seam itself. After one day, the migration of gas was completely controlled by the fractures. The presence of fractures in the overlying rock enables the gas in coal seam to migrate more easily to the surrounding rocks or extraction tunnels situated relatively far away from the coal rock These conclusions provide an important theoretical basis for gas extraction.",
2866,"Nitrate sources and biogeochemical processes in karst underground rivers impacted by different anthropogenic input characteristics Nitrate is one of the most common pollution sources in groundwater, particularly in highly vulnerable karst aquifers. The potential for nitrification and denitrification within karst aquifers varies in different settings depending on the extent of anthropogenic inputs, so that accurate identification of nitrate sources can be difficult. Geochemical data and dual nitrate isotopes were measured in this study, incorporating a Bayesian isotopic mixing model, and used to identify nitrate sources, nitrification and denitrification, and quantitatively determine nitrate sources under different extents of anthropogenic inputs in three karst catchments within Chongqing Municipality, SW China: Laolongdong (an urbanized area), Qingmuguan (a suburban village), and Shuifang Spring (a protected natural area). At the Laolongdong catchment, the groundwater was in a reducing condition and enriched in Î´(15)N(NO3) (averaging 18.9Â Â±Â 6.9â€°) and Î´(18)O(NO3) (averaging 8.5Â Â±Â 4.6â€°). Manure and sewage waste were the main contributing nitrate sources. A slope of 1.8: 1 of the dual isotopes suggested a denitrification process occurring in anaerobic conduit flow. Within the Qingmuguan catchment, groundwater had average Î´(15)N(NO3) and Î´(18)O(NO3) values of 9.7Â Â±Â 3.5â€°, and 1.9Â Â±Â 3.4â€°, respectively. The data showed evidence for nitrification, and the contribution of soil organic nitrogen was 52.1%, followed by a contribution of 44.8% from manure and wastewater. At the Shuifang Spring catchment, the mean Î´(15)N(NO3) and Î´(18)O(NO3) values in groundwater were 8.8Â Â±Â 2.9â€°, 2.3Â Â±Â 4.6â€°, respectively. Nitrification was the dominant process and most of the nitrate was derived from soil organic nitrogen. This study suggests that karst underground rivers overlain by urban land use undergo denitrification, while the suburban and relatively pristine karst aquifers are dominated by nitrification, allowing development of a conceptual model for nitrate sources and transformations in karst aquifers from the categories of land use (i.e., urban, suburban, and pristine areas). MAIN FINDING: Anthropogenic activities can change biogeochemical nitrogen dynamics of vulnerable karst aquifers, such that the groundwater overlain by an urban settlement has undergone denitrification, while suburban and pristine areas have been dominated by nitrification.",
2867,"The impact of loading frequency and copper as a biocide on biosand filter performance Biological sand filters (BSFs) can appropriately serve as point-of-use water treatment in developing nations. This study examined the benefit of adding copper to a BSF, and evaluated the impact of its addition in relation to extended pause times. Four 70-L BSFs were created - copper was incorporated in the packing of the two BSFs labeled Filter 1 and Filter 3. Filters 1 and 2 were loaded daily while Filters 3 and 4 were watered every third day. Source water was taken from the Ocmulgee River in Macon, Georgia. To investigate variation due to watering frequency and biocidal addition, BSF performance was quantified using coliforms, turbidity, solids, dissolved oxygen, pH, and copper analyses. E. coli removal efficiencies for Filters 1, 2, 3, and 4 averaged 90, 77, 87, and 80%, respectively. Paired t-tests at alpha = 0.05 indicate that effluent coliform concentrations from filters watered daily were significantly impacted by the presence of copper. Filters loaded every third day showed no significant performance effect from copper addition on coliform removal efficiency. Similar paired t-tests at alpha = 0.05 for turbidity, solids, and COD showed no significant difference between filter performance.",
2868,"Synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation in development Case studies of Amman, Jakarta, and Dar es Salaam Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how cities at different stages of development each subject to its own challenges in adapting to climate change can manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Design/methodology/approach - Case studies are undertaken for three cities: Amman, Jakarta and Dar es Salaam, including determination of GHG emissions and analysis of climate change data (where available) for each. Findings - In Amman, the most climate-sensitive municipal service is water; Jordan is exceptionally dry, and nearly 15 per cent of all electricity consumption is by the water authority. Jakarta has already experienced extreme flooding. The climate vulnerabilities associated with sea-level rise are intensified by subsidence in parts of Jakarta. Alternating floods and droughts are climate impacts already experienced in Dar es Salaam. Droughts have impacted Tanzania's electricity infrastructure disrupting hydroelectricity production, requiring new natural gas infrastructure to maintain power, thereby increasing GHG emissions. Nonetheless, Dar es Salaam's GHG emissions at 0.56 t CO(2)e/cap are small compared to Amman and Jakarta at 3.66 and 4.92 t CO(2)e/cap., respectively. Originality/value - Synergist development strategies, addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation are suggested. In Amman an increased share of photovoltaic electricity production might be used for service provision, especially for energy needs surrounding water supply. Advanced slum upgrading in Jakarta could see relocation of the at-risk poor to safe areas with energy efficient homes connected to public transit and decentralized, community-based electricity generation. The focus in Dar es Salaam community-based waste-to-energy facilities would reduce climate change impacts and vulnerabilities while addressing energy poverty in poor communities.",
2869,"The toxic effects of saline drinking water on young turkey poults Turkey poults were offered ad libitum a diet containing 2.5 g salt/kg and tap water containing, 0, 90 or 105 mn NaCl to drink from 1 to 12 d of age. 2. High mortality with oedbema and ascites occurred mainly from 5 to 8 d in poults given the saline solutions. Mortality seemed to be related to salt and water intakes. 3. Plasma and body composition indicated abnormal retention of salt and water in poults younger than 12 d of age offered hypotonic saline. 4. In a second experiment using the same diet poults were offered hypotonic saline (105 mn NaCl in tap water) from 5, 9 or 13 d of age. High mortality with oedema and ascites was only observed when saline was given from 5 or 9 d. 5. The results suggest that from about 5 to 10 d of age there is a relative functional renal insufficiency which causes susceptibility to the toxic effects of saline water.",
2870,"Metal cations present in drinking water samples in and aroÃºnd rangia town, district kamrup, assam There has been a serious concern over the deterioration of pure drinking water quality in cities and towns.

2871,"Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian crustal evolution of the Pan-African Saldania Belt, South Africa The Saldania Belt forms part of a system of Neoproterozoic mobile belts that surround and weld older cratons on the African continent. It is a poorly exposed, low-grade orogenic belt composed of a number of inliers unroofed in mega-anticlinal hinges of the Permo-Triassic Cape Fold Belt, along the southern tip of Africa. Deformed meta-volcanosedimentary units are contained within tectonostratigraphic terranes separated by deep-rooted, sinistral/dextral strike-slip fault zones, which display evidence of prolonged reactivation. Sedimentary rocks and volcanics of the Boland terrane (Malmesbury Group), lower Kango Group and Gamtoos Group are considered to be distal facies of rift successions, overlying the mid-Proterozoic crystalline basement on the southwestern edge of the Kalahari Craton. These lithologies have been deposited in semi-pull-apart basins that formed in response to the breakup of Rodinia and progressive opening of the proto-Atlantic (Adamaster Ocean) from 780-750 Ma. Fragments of juvenile pan-African crust with WPB-MORB characteristics occur in the Bridgetown Formation (Swartland terrane, Malmesbury inlier) and attest to ocean floor spreading in this belt. The thick turbidite successions of the Swartland and Tygerberg terranes (Malmesbury Group) reflect deeper water conditions and were deposited partly on oceanic crust in an evolving ocean/continental margin basin marked by increasing sea levels and reduction of continental freeboard. Reversal of spreading and closing of the Adamastor Ocean, possibly initiated by the opening of Iapetus, occurred in the period 600-570 Ma. Although this movement vector caused sinistral transpressional reactivation of the Gariep and Saldanian margins, there is no proper collision orogen developed in the Saldania Belt. The Bridgetown Formation represents the suture between the southern, rifted margin succession of the Kalahari Craton and a poorly developed southern orogenic belt represented in part by the Swartland and Tygerberg terranes. This geosuture is similar to that of the South Atlantic, which formed in the analogous Gariep Belt between 575 and 543 Ma. Multiphase S-, I- and A-type granites of the Cape Granite Suite intruded the Saldania Belt in a pervasive transpressive regime between 550 and 510 Ma, comparing well with the timing of peak metamorphism/collision in the Gariep Belt (545 Ma). The absence of a proper collisional orogen and the strongly developed northwesterly structural grain in the Saldania Belt seem to suggest that the Cape Granite Suite was generated in a strike-slip regime. A discrepancy of approximately 50 Ma between the age of the collision granites of the Dom Feliciano Belt and Cape Granite Suite suggests that they are genetically unrelated. Similarities in structural styles, magmatism and dated events between the Saldania-Ross-Delamarian chain of orogens, however, indicate a common history. The evolution of this chain and that of the Gariep-Damara-Dom Feliciano Belts can be accommodated in a single plate tectonic model of simultaneous sinistral transpressive subduction driven by the rifting of Laurentia from South America and opening of the Iapetus Ocean. Loading and depression of the western and southern Kalahari Craton margin by thrust stacks of the Late Neoproterozoic orogens led to the formation of syn- to post-orogenic peripheral foreland basins, such as those represented by the Nama and Vanrhynsdorp Groups, lowering of sea level and increased continental freeboard. Deposition of the unconformity based upper Kango Group, and possibly the molassic Fransehhoek Formation, occurred in intra-orogen pull-apart basins, which possibly developed between 530 and 510 Ma in the Saldania Belt.

2872,"ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION OF POLLUTIONS DUE TO AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN DRINKING WATER BASINS Water supplies have been polluted by moving waters with surface flowing and wind pesticide granules as a result of spraying against pest and diseases or discharging factory wastes to stagnant waters or rivers. Also, unawares and overusage of chemical fertilisers in agricultural activities have in the course of time made aridity and made negative effects both with water pollution and other effects. It has to be evaluated relating to measures about preventing agricultural pollution at this scope. At this context, the negative effects of agricultural activities in water basin areas can be minimised. For example, it may be thought that there can be a transition from traditional agricultural production to alternative agricultural methods (good agricultural practices, organic agriculture) agricultural workings in water basin areas. Also, irrigated agricultural activities have been performed in the basins. Fertilisers wastes and pesticide residues which constitute nutrition in lake dam can cause serious problems, because turning waters from irrigation reach natural water supplies in the basin. Especially, for the pollution of ground waters, nitrate is seen as the most common ground water polluter. Required legal arrangements have been done at protecting the drinking water basin areas in Turkey. 'Regulation of the Protecting of Waters Against Pollution by Nitrates from Agricultural Sources' had been legislated in this respect in 2004. But, it is necessary to do more effective works considering the current conditions. For these reasons, the main goals of the study are first to analyse the present literature and then to fix contamination and problems in the basins due to agricultural activities, and to look for preventions against contamination of drinking water. Also, it is thought that findings which will be introduced with research will be useful for institutions in this sector, decision-makers related to sector, people related to this subject and people who live in the basin area.",
2873,"Quantifying Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Dynamics in the Jinsha Watershed, Upper Yangtze, China from 1975 to 2000 Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and carbon fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is critical to our understanding of regional patterns of carbon budgets. Here we use the General Ensemble biogeochemical Modeling System to simulate the terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics in the Jinsha watershed of China's upper Yangtze basin from 1975 to 2000, based on unique combinations of spatial and temporal dynamics of major driving forces, such as climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, and land use and land cover changes. Our analysis demonstrates that the Jinsha watershed ecosystems acted as a carbon sink during the period of 1975-2000, with an average rate of 0.36 Mg/ha/yr, primarily resulting from regional climate variation and local land use and land cover change. Vegetation biomass accumulation accounted for 90.6% of the sink, while soil organic carbon loss before 1992 led to a lower net gain of carbon in the watershed, and after that soils became a small sink. Ecosystem carbon sink/source patterns showed a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Carbon sinks were associated with forest areas without disturbances, whereas carbon sources were primarily caused by stand-replacing disturbances. It is critical to adequately represent the detailed fast-changing dynamics of land use activities in regional biogeochemical models to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of regional carbon sink/source patterns.",
2874,"A Comparison of Markov Chain Random Field and Ordinary Kriging Methods for Calculating Soil Texture in a Mountainous Watershed, Northwest China Accurate mapping the spatial distribution of different soil textures is important for eco-hydrological studies and water resource management. However, it is quite a challenge to map the soil texture in data scarce, hard to access mountainous watersheds. This paper compares a nonlinear method, the Markov chain random field (MCRF) with a classical linear method, ordinary kriging (OK) for calculating the soil texture at different search radiuses in the upstream region of the Heihe River Watershed. Results show that soil texture values that were calculated by the OK method tends to predict soil texture values within a certain range (sand (12.098 similar to 40.317), silt (47.847 similar to 71.231), and clay (12.781 similar to 19.420)) because of the smoothing effect, thus leading to greater accuracy in predicting the major soil texture type (silt loam). Nonetheless, the MCRF method considers the interclass relationships between sampling points, leading to greater accuracy in predicting minor types (loam and sandy loam). Meanwhile, the OK method performed best for all the types at the radius of 65 km influenced by the densities of all the sampling points, while the best performance of the MCRF method differs with radiuses as the largest densities varying for different soil types. For loam and sandy loam, the OK method ignored them, thus the MCRF method is more suitable in mountainous areas with high soil heterogeneity.",
2875,"In vitro screening of plant extracts traditionally used as cancer remedies in Ghana - 15-Hydroxyangustilobine A as the active principle in Alstonia boonei leaves ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cancer represents a major health burden and drain on the global healthcare systems. Traditional African medicine widely use a variety of plant species for treatment of different kinds of cancer. A previous systematic survey by traditional healers in the Ashanti region of Ghana revealed a good overview on the plant species and herbal materials used for the different types of cancer. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The following study aimed to investigate 18 herbal materials from 10 plant species based on the cancer survey in Ghana regarding potential cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines under in vitro conditions followed by subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation towards the active principle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol-water (1:1) extracts were tested (1-100Â Î¼g/mL) against a panel of cancer cell lines according to their respective traditional use. Selected extracts with relevant cytotoxicity in this screening were also tested against common pediatric malignancies (leukemias (HL-60, REH) and Ewing sarcoma (RD-ES and CADO-ES1)). Bioassay-guided fractionation of the hydroalcoholic extract from Alstonia boonei was performed by liquid-liquid chromatography and preparative HPLC. Preliminary mechanistic studies on the mode of action were performed by flow cytometric cell cycle analysis as well as apoptosis and necrosis staining. RESULTS: Screening of plant extracts revealed relevant cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cell lines for Alstonia boonei leaves and stem of Paulinia pinnata. The A. boonei extract was additionally found to be active against common pediatric tumor types (leukemias and Ewing sarcoma). Bioassay-guided fractionation of the A. boonei extract revealed the presence of 15-hydroxyangustilobine A 1 as the active principle (IC(50) 26Â Î¼M against MCF-7Â cells). This is the first report of this compound in A. boonei. 1 was shown to lead to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M-phase (MCF-7Â cells), triggering cells at least partially into apoptosis. CONCLUSION: In summary, an appreciable in vitro activity was revealed for the leaf extract from A. boonei and the isolated vallesamine type indole alkaloid 1, which has to be investigated in future studies towards a potential clinical use.",
2876,"Temperature structure and dynamic background of crust and mantle beneath the high heat flow area of the South China continental margin The South China continental margin is an important region of mineral and geothermal resources of our country. In this area, the Pacific plate's westward subduction and the small-scale unstable mantle thermal convection associated with the subduction have led to complex tectonic deformation, multi-period magmatic activities, and extensive mineralization since late Mesozoic. Based on surface heat flow data and shear wave velocity data, as well as harmonic coefficients of gravity, this paper calculates the crust and mantle temperature structure and analyzes the geodynamic background. The results show that the thermal structure is of the ""cold-crust/hot-mantle"" type in the South China continental margin. Over 10 km of the shallow crust, the temperature is above 200 degrees C. The Curie temperature is 475 degrees C and the average temperature of Moho is 550 degrees C. Although there is a high temperature layer in the shallow crust caused by the high decay heat of the radioactive elements in the granite, the overall crustal temperature is low and the tectonics is stable. In the mantle, at 90 km, the temperature is 950 similar to 1250 degrees C at depth 90 km, 1050 similar to 1400 degrees C at 120 km, 1200 similar to 1450 degrees C at 150 km, 1500 similar to 1700 degrees C at 220 km, respectively. The ""hot"" lithospheric bottom boundary determined by the 1300 degrees C adiabatic isothermal surface is between 110 similar to 450 km which becomes thinner from west to east. The mantle stress field shows a pattern of alternating compression and extension in the lithosphere and an elliptical with a NE-SW directed long-axis centered at Nanchang city. We suggest that the subduction of the Pacific plate is the main factor that controlled the deep structure and hot-tectonic process for the continental margin of South China. The westward subduction of the Pacific plate has aroused local thermal activity of the deep mantle and localized unstable mantle convective disturbance superimposed on the regional southeast mantle convective background since late Mesozoic. During the period of 175 similar to 85 Ma, the upper mantle material flowed upwards and formed different magma activity peak periods. Meanwhile, the lithospheric mantle was affected by the subducted oceanic crust fluid with high water content and small viscosity. Under the action of the tangential stress field of the mantle, the thickness of the lithosphere was thinned from west to east in a ""water wave"" form. The magmatic activity of the continental margin in southern China had largely completed in the Early Cretaceous. Although there are still small-scale thermal convective temperature conditions in the current deep mantle, in addition to the surface shallow higher temperature, the overall crustal temperature is relatively low and the lithosphere is stable.",
2877,"Evaluation of hydrosphere state of the Dniester river catchment This contribution presents the current state of the environment in the largest river basin of West Ukraine, the Dniester, on the background of the total river system of Ukraine. According to the results of the hydro-and lithochemical investigations performed during the period of 1995-2001, the Dniester River system is in a satisfactory state according to total macrocomponents composition, nitric compounds and heavy metals content. But ground waters of the region are regionally polluted by nitrate-ions. thanks to the wide use of mineral fertilizers, wastewaters of animal farms and municipal sewage. Surface waters of the Dniester River, its tributaries and the Dniester Reservoir are strongly regionally polluted by phenols and oil-products, that may be connected with man-made as well as natural factors.",
2878,"Oil Spill Detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Using Lipschitz-Regularity and Multiscale Techniques This research adapts an effective change detection approach originally applied to mapping fire scar from a stationary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scene to the problem of oil spills from SAR data. The method presented here combines several advanced image processing techniques to mitigate some of the common performance limitations of SAR-based oil spill detection. Principally among these limitations are the following. First, the radar cross section of the areas affected by an oil spill strongly depends on wind and wave effects, and is, therefore, highly variable. Second, the radar cross section of oil covered water is often indistinguishable from other dark ocean features such as low wind areas, which leads to errors and uncertainties in oil spill detection. In this paper, we introduce a multi-image analysis, the Lipschitz regularity (LR), and wavelet transforms as a combined approach to mitigate these performance limitations. We show that the LR parameter is much less sensitive to variations of wind and waves in an oil spill SAR imagery, lending itself well for normalizing and suppressing ocean background using image ratio processing. We combine LR processing with a multiscale technique based on the wavelet transform to additionally achieve high-quality noise suppression. To describe the performance of this approach under controlled conditions, we applied our method to simulated SAR data of wind-driven oceans with oil spills and low wind areas. We also applied our method to several real-world oil spill data acquired during the 2010 Deep Water Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.",
2879,"Development, local livelihoods, and vulnerabilities to global environmental change in the South American Dry Andes Climate change will increasingly impact large areas of South America, affecting important natural resources and people's livelihoods. These impacts will make rural people disproportionately more vulnerable, given their dependency on ecosystem services and their exposure to other stressors, such as new rules imposed by agribusiness and trends toward the commodification of natural resources. This paper focuses on the vulnerability of rural communities in Andean drylands of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, showing how different economic and political pathways lead to different levels of vulnerability. The paper begins with a brief discussion of the methodological and theoretical concept of vulnerability, which framed the research. Starting from the premise that global environmental change impacts are strongly linked to styles of development, the discussion explores the diverse institutional capital and governance schemes as well as different development styles in the case studies and their role in increasing or reducing local vulnerability to climate and water scarcity. Using a comparative perspective, the exposures and adaptive capacities of rural actors in three river basins are discussed, emphasizing situations that speak for the ways in which development styles counteract or magnify conditions of vulnerability. The analysis considers irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture, water property interests, different productive structures (viticulture, horticulture, etc.), producer typologies (large/small, export, etc.), and geographical location. Finally, the paper offers some insights about development style and adaptive capacities of rural people to overcome those vulnerabilities.",
2880,"Intercropping maize and wheat with conservation agriculture principles improves water harvesting and reduces carbon emissions in dry areas In arid and populated areas or countries, water shortage and heavy carbon emissions are threatening agricultural sustainability with food security severely, and becoming a major issue. It is unclear whether improved farming systems can be developed to tackle those issues through a sustainable agriculture. Here three farming practices that have proven to be essential and successful, which were: (a) crop intensification through strip intercropping, (b) water harvesting through conservation tillage; and (c) carbon sequestration through improved crop residue management options, were integrated in one cropping system. We hypothesize that the integrated system allows the increase of crop yields with improved water use efficiency, while reducing carbon emissions from farming. The hypothesis was tested in field experiments at Hexi Corridor (37 degrees 96'N, 102 degrees 64'E) in northwest China. We found that the integrated system increased soil moisture (mm) by 7.4% before sowing, 10.3% during the wheat-maize co-growth period, 8.3% after wheat harvest, and 9.2% after maize harvest, compared to the conventional sole cropping systems. The wheat/maize intercrops increased net primary production by 68% and net ecosystem production by 72%; and when combined with straw mulching on the soil surface, it decreased carbon emissions by 16%, compared to the monoculture maize without mulch. The wheat/maize intercrops used more water but increased grain yields by 142% over the monoculture wheat and by 23% over the monoculture maize, thus, enhancing water use efficiency by an average of 26%. We conclude that integrating strip intercropping, conservation tillage as well as straw mulching in one cropping system can significantly boost crop yields, improve the use efficiency of the limited water resources in arid areas, while, lowering the carbon emissions from farming. The integrated system may be considered in the development of strategies for alleviating food security issues currently experienced in the environment-damaged and water-shortage areas.

2881,"Characteristics and genesis of pisolitic soil layers in a tropical moist semi-deciduous forest of Ghana In the tropical moist semi-deciduous forests of West Africa, gravelly soil horizons common on the summits and upper slopes in the landscape, are often covered by a thin layer of gravel-free soil. Previous investigations have shown that these top layers are formed by termites transporting gravel-free soil material from the subsoil to fallen logs and branches on the soil surface. The present study located at the upper part of a catena at Kade in Ghana shows that the gravel consists of iron nodules or pisolites of varying degree of cementation, quartz and a few remnants of unweathered metamorphic stones. According to chemical and mineralogical studies of pisolites from E, Bt and Bt/Cg horizons, pisolites in the three horizons consist of well crystallized goethite and hematite, and the pisolite content and hardness decrease with increasing soil depth. Furthermore, the very hard pisolites from the E horizon are richer in total iron oxides, especially hematite, than the pisolites in the horizons below but iron oxide crystallinity is similar in the three horizons indicating that pisolite hardening depends on the total content of iron oxides, in particular hematite. Based on the location of the gravel-rich soil horizon in the landscape, a general route for development of pisolite-rich soil horizons in West Africa is proposed including the following processes: (i) An upward transport of gravel-free material to the soil surface due to termite activity, (ii) ongoing removal of this material by water erosion, (iii) weathering of the rather soft metamorphic bedrock present at shallow depth and (iv) gley formation. These processes will over time lead to a lowering of the land surface and concentration of pisolites at the soil surface or in a layer near the soil surface. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

2882,"Hydraulic performance of riverbank filtration: case study West Sohag, Egypt Riverbank Filtration (RBF) Technology has been found to be a safe, renewable, sustainable, and cost-effective drinking water treatment or pretreatment technology. The Egyptian government has recently turned to riverbank filtration to conserve drinking and industrial water at a lower cost and higher efficiency. The study aims to assess the hydraulic performance of the riverbank filtration system in west Sohag, Egypt. MODFLOW and MODPATH 10.2.3 were used under the platform of Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) to construct a hydraulic groundwater flow model to simulate the flow of the riverbank filtration system. Six pumping rates with two scenarios were conducted to investigate the system's hydraulic performance. Water samples were collected from the Nile River, abstraction wells, and groundwater to characterize the water quality. The results indicated that the application of riverbank filtration is promising due to the significant hydraulic connection between the Nile and the aquifer. However, the system hydraulic aspects should be taken into consideration during the design phase as they may affect the RBF hydraulic performance and its efficiency. It became apparent how effective RBF is at eliminating pathogens and suspended solids. Infiltrated water, on the other hand, has higher iron and manganese amounts than the Nile water.",
2883,"Performance and yield stability of maize hybrids in stress-prone environments in eastern Africa Identification and deployment of high-yielding and stress-tolerant maize hybrids adapted to stress-prone agro-ecologies is important for improving the food security and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in eastern Africa. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the performance of maize hybrids under well-watered and drought stress conditions; (ii) evaluate grain yield stability of 65 intermediate-maturing and 55 early-maturing hybrids in 24 well-watered locations and seven drought stress locations; and (iii) identify representative and/or discriminative testing locations for increasing genetic gains for the target traits. There were significant differences for grain yield among early- and intermediate-maturing hybrids tested under well-watered and drought stress environments. Among the early-maturing hybrids, the top 10 hybrids produced 46.8%-73.9% and 31.2%-42.1% higher mean grain yields than the best commercial check under drought and well-watered conditions, respectively. Among the intermediate-maturing hybrids, the top 10 hybrids produced 25.2%-47.7% and 8.5%-13.5% higher grain yield than commercial checks under drought stress and well-watered conditions, respectively, suggesting improvement in the levels of drought tolerance in both early- and intermediate-maturing hybrids. GGE biplot analysis and a bi-segmented regression linear method identified specific early-maturing and intermediate-maturing hybrids that performed well under both well-watered and drought stress conditions. These hybrids could be recommended for commercial production in eastern Africa. Kakamega in Kenya was found to be the most representative and highly discriminating site among well-watered testing locations, while Kabuku in Tanzania was the least representative of test locations. For testing under drought stress conditions, Kiboko in Kenya was identified as the most representative location. This information could be useful for allocating resources and streamlining CIMMYT maize hybrid testing in eastern Africa. (C) 2019 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

2884,"Assessment and Causes of Groundwater Organic Pollution in Typical Plain Areas in Xinjiang, China To study the organic pollution situation in groundwater in plain areas in Xinjiang, Shihezi region (SHZ), plain area of Yanqi Basin (YQ) and Ruoqiang-Qiemo area (RQ) were selected as the typical areas. 83 groundwater samples were collected, tested, and analyzed for 39 organic indexes for the first time. Results showed that the local groundwater in SHZ, YQ, and RQ had been slightly affected by organic pollution with the detection rates of 8.7, 33.3, and 33.3 %, respectively. Seven organic pollutants were detected, including chloroform (with the highest detection rate of 21.7 %), 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, toluene, benzo(a)pyrene, alpha-BHC, and gamma-BHC. The contents of all the detected organic pollutants were low, which were under the limits of the ""Standards for Drinking Water Quality (GB5749-2006)"". Vertical distribution of detection rates was that in SHZ, shallow confined groundwater (12.5 %) > deep confined groundwater (10.0 %) > unconfined groundwater (0.0 %); in YQ, unconfined groundwater (66.7 %) > deep confined groundwater (29.2 %) > shallow confined groundwater (25.0 %); in RQ, shallow confined groundwater (66.7 %) > unconfined groundwater (33.3 %) > deep confined groundwater (16.7 %). The sources and properties of organic pollutants were the main factors that affected groundwater organic pollution in the study areas. The infiltration recharge of surface water mainly affected groundwater organic pollution in SHZ and YQ. Besides, the vadose zone had a certain restriction on the occurrence and migration of groundwater organic pollution components in RQ. Direct discharge of sewage came from human life and production without treatment, and leakage due to crude anti-seepage facilities had led to groundwater organic pollution. The organic wastewater produced in livestock and poultry breeding, chemical fertilizers, and insecticides in agricultural activities were also the main sources of groundwater organic pollution.",
2885,"Association of soil arsenic and nickel exposure with cancer mortality rates, a town-scale ecological study in Suzhou, China Heavy metals and arsenic are well-known carcinogens. However, few studies have examined whether soil heavy metals and arsenic concentrations associate with cancer in the general population. In this ecological study, we aimed to evaluate the association of heavy metals and arsenic in soil with cancer mortality rates during 2005-2010 in Suzhou, China, after controlling for education and smoking prevalence. In 2005, a total of 1683 soil samples with a sampling density of one sample every 4 km(2) were analyzed. Generalized linear model with a quasi-Poisson regression was applied to evaluate the association between town-scale cancer mortality rates and soil heavy metal concentrations. Results showed that soil arsenic exposure had a significant relationship with colon, gastric, kidney, lung, and nasopharyngeal cancer mortality rates and soil nickel exposure was significantly associated with liver and lung cancer. The associations of soil arsenic and nickel exposure with colon, gastric, kidney, and liver cancer in male were higher than those in female. The observed associations of soil arsenic and nickel with cancer mortality rates were less sensitive to alternative exposure metrics. Our findings would contribute to the understanding of the carcinogenic effect of soil arsenic and nickel exposure in general population.",
2886,"Flotation of PGM-containing minerals: Plant-wide regression and prediction of circuit performance A crucial step in the processing of PGM-bearing reefs in South Africa is the flotation of the sulfidic minerals from the host rock. Flotation plays a crucial role in reducing the mass of material to be processed further downstream by smelting, converting and hydrometallurgical refining. However, flotation has the lowest recovery of valuable metals along the processing chain. As a result, small improvements in efficiency in flotation have an enormous benefit to the company's performance. Modelling and simulation play an important role in circuit optimisation, due to the ability to test and examine multiple options in a small amount of time without affecting the operational circuit. Unfortunately flotation is extremely difficult to model and simulate due to the complexity of the mechanism and the large number of variables involved. Whole circuit modelling is even more difficult, for the reasons already mentioned as well as maintaining a consistent mass balance in the face of multiple recycle streams. The purpose of this work is to construct a whole-circuit model of a flotation circuit, and use the model to predict the effect of changes to the flotation circuit. A goal in the construction of the model was to use as few parameters as possible. The work presented in this paper is focused on the regression of the parameters of a first-order kinetic flotation model to actual pilot plant data. The performance of the model was then validated by predicting the behaviour of a modified flotation circuit. The regression showed excellent correlation with actual plant data on a bank by bank basis. Using the regressed parameters directly on a modified circuit configuration, the model was able to predict the circuit behaviour when compared to plant data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2887,"A Simplified Model to Estimate the Concentration of Inorganic Ions and Heavy Metals in Rivers This paper presents a model that uses only pH, alkalinity, and temperature to estimate the concentrations of major ions in rivers (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-, and NO3-) together with the equilibrium concentrations of minor ions and heavy metals (Fe3+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Al3+, Pb2+, and Zn2+). Mining operations have been increasing, which has led to changes in the pollution loads to receiving water systems, meanwhile most developing countries cannot afford water quality monitoring. A possible solution is to implement less resource-demanding monitoring programs, supported by mathematical models that minimize the required sampling and analysis, while still being able to detect water quality changes, thereby allowing implementation of measures to protect the water resources. The present model was developed using existing theories for: (i) carbonate equilibrium; (ii) total alkalinity; (iii) statistics of major ions; (iv) solubility of minerals; and (v) conductivity of salts in water. The model includes two options to estimate the concentrations of major ions: (1) a generalized method, which employs standard values from a world-wide data base; and (2) a customized method, which requires specific baseline data for the river of interest. The model was tested using data from four monitoring stations in Swedish rivers with satisfactory results.",
2888,"Meso-Neoproterozoic Stratigraphic and Tectonic Framework of the North China Craton The Meso-Neoproterozoic sedimentary strata of the North China Craton (NCC) occur mainly in the Xiong'er Rift in the southern marginal part of the craton, the Yanliao Rift in the central region, and the Zhaertai Bayan Obo Rift on the northern margin. In recent years, high-precision zircon U-Pb dating ages from several crucial stratums in Yanliao rift system provided a strong foundation for reconstruction of Meso-Neoproterozoic strati graphic framework in NCC. These revolutionary progresses require new recognitions for tectonic evolution of NCC in Meso-Neoproterozoic. Among these progresses, the most important breakthrough is that Neoproterozoic Xiamaling formation in former research is redivided into Mesoproterozoic stratums and redefined as building system. In the latest standard scheme of China stratigraphic chart, Changcheng system, Jixian system, building system, Qingbaikou system, Nanhua system, and Sinian system are, respectively, limited into 1.8-1.6 Ga, 1.6-1.4 Ga, 1.4-1.0 Ga, 1.0-0.78 Ga, 780-635 Ma, 635-541 Ma. Under the new stratigraphic framework, the Mesoproterozoic Changcheng System consists of clastic rocks of the tidal flat littoral facies, and the Jixian System contains carbonate rocks of the neritic facies in the lower section and clastic rocks of the tidal flat littoral facies in the upper section. Therefore, the sedimentary sequences of these systems record a complete sedimentary sequence from transgression to regression. The Neoproterozoic Qinbaikou and Nanhua systems are transgressive sequences consisting of clastic rocks of the tidal flat littoral facies in lower sections and carbonate rocks of the neritic facies in upper sections. These changes in lithology indicate increasing water depth over time. The Sinian System is composed of tillite, which occurs along the western and southern margins of the NCC and in the Longshoushan area, on the southern margin of the Alxa Block. Based on the sedimentary characteristics of the Meso-Neoproterozoic strata, as well as multiple magmatic events, we identify five phases in the evolution of the NCC during this period: (1) continental rifting during the early Mesoproterozoic, (2) a passive continental margin during the middle Mesoproterozoic, (3) an active continental margin during the late Mesoproterozoic, (4) extrusion and uplift, and (5) continental rifting at the end of the Mesoproterozoic and beginning of the Neoproterozoic. The first two stages likely record the final break-up of the Columbia supercontinent, whereas stages three to five may have been linked to the assembly and break-up of the Rodinia supercontinent.",
2889,"Predicting water consumption habits for seven arsenic-safe water options in Bangladesh BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, 20 million people are at the risk of developing arsenicosis because of excessive arsenic intake. Despite increased awareness, many of the implemented arsenic-safe water options are not being sufficiently used by the population. This study investigated the role of social-cognitive factors in explaining the habitual use of arsenic-safe water options. METHODS: Eight hundred seventy-two randomly selected households in six arsenic-affected districts of rural Bangladesh, which had access to an arsenic-safe water option, were interviewed using structured face-to-face interviews in November 2009. Habitual use of arsenic-safe water options, severity, vulnerability, affective and instrumental attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, self-efficacy, and coping planning were measured. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regressions. RESULTS: Linear regression revealed that self-efficacy (Bâ€‰=â€‰0.42, SEâ€‰=â€‰.03, pâ€‰<â€‰.001), the instrumental attitude towards the safe water option (Bâ€‰=â€‰0.24, SEâ€‰=â€‰.04, pâ€‰<â€‰.001), the affective attitude towards contaminated tube wells (Bâ€‰=â€‰-0.04, SEâ€‰=â€‰.02, pâ€‰=â€‰.024), vulnerability (Bâ€‰=â€‰-0.20, SEâ€‰=â€‰.02, pâ€‰<â€‰.001), as well as injunctive (Bâ€‰=â€‰0.08, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.04, pâ€‰=â€‰.049) and descriptive norms (Bâ€‰=â€‰0.34, SEâ€‰=â€‰.03, pâ€‰<â€‰.001) primarily explained the habitual use of arsenic-safe water options (R2â€‰=â€‰0.688). This model proved highly generalizable to all seven arsenic-safe water options investigated, even though habitual use of single options were predicted on the basis of parameters estimated without these options. CONCLUSIONS: This general model for the habitual use of arsenic-safe water options may prove useful to predict other water consumption habits. Behavior-change interventions are derived from the model to promote the habitual use of arsenic-safe water options.",
2890,"Lead poisoning in new immigrant children from the mainland of China OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence, severity and risk factors for lead poisoning in new immigrant children from the mainland of China to Hong Kong, China. METHODS: New immigrant children from the mainland of China under 18 years of age were invited to join the study. Their growth parameters and venous blood lead levels (BLL) were measured within 7 days of arrival. Those with elevated BLL i.e. > 10 micrograms/dl (0.48 mumol/L) were assessed for signs, symptoms and risk factors of lead poisoning. Education on the prevention of lead poisoning and follow up BLL measurements were offered until their BLL normalized. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-seven children were recruited. Among them, 18.1% and 2.6% had BLL > 0.48 and 0.71 mumol/L, respectively. None had BLL > 0.96 mumol/L. Possible risk factors included contaminated drinking water (19%), herb ingestion (17.5%), pica, playing in dumping grounds, residing near paint factories or highways, habitual inhalation of car exhaust and cooking with petroleum. Symptoms and signs included abdominal pain, headache, short stature, and learning difficulties but did not correlate with BLL. None required treatment except for counseling on the avoidance of risk factors. About 94.7% showed a reduction in BLL 2-3 months after arrival and before counseling. All had normalized BLL by 9 months except 1 who had an X-ray feature of lead line. CONCLUSIONS: Lead poisoning is common in new immigrant children from the mainland of China. Environmental factors were most important while behavioral factors like regular herb ingestion might have contributed to the persistence of high BLL in the minority.",
2891,"Stability, preservation and storage of As(iii), DMA, MMA and As(v) in water samples Correct handling and preservation of water samples is crucial to ensure their integrity for arsenic speciation measurements. ISO TS 19620:2018 is a method for the determination of arsenic(iii) and arsenic(v) species in waters by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). During the development of this method, a study was performed to establish the best practices for storage and preservation of samples to maintain the integrity of the arsenic speciation and stability. Four arsenic species were studied: arsenite (As(iii)), arsenate (As(v)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in three different water types: deionised water, mineral water and natural river water. The effect of sample bottle material, light, storage temperature, and acidification were evaluated. When samples are acidified and refrigerated, they can reliably be stored for up to 12 weeks without significantly affecting the arsenic concentration and speciation. The sample bottle material and light had no affect on the speciation integrity or stability.",
2892,"Comparison of artificial neural networks and autoregressive model for inflows forecasting of Roseires Reservoir for better prediction of irrigation water supply in Sudan The Blue Nile River is utilized in Sudan as the main source of irrigation water. However, the river has a long, dry, low-flow season (October-May), which necessitates the use of regulations and rules to manage its water use during this period. This depends on the use of accurate lead time forecasts of inflows to the reservoirs built along the river. Thus a reliable and tested forecasting tool is needed to provide inflow forecast, with sufficient lead time. In the present study, artificial neural network (ANN) is used to model the recession curve of the flow hydrograph at El-Deim gauging station, which subsequently is used as inflows to the Roseires Reservoir on the Blue Nile River. Different scenarios of ANN have been tested to forecast 23 10-day mean discharges during the recession period and their performances were assessed. Results from the optimal ANN model were compared to those simulated with an autoregressive (AR1) model to check their accuracy. Modelling results showed that the ANN model developed is capable of accurately forecasting the inflows to the Roseires Reservoir and outperforms the AR1 model. It has then proposed for use in operation of the reservoir for purposes of predicting irrigation water supply.",
2893,"Spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field Springs are the natural discharge points of groundwater. They are of considerable value for drinking water supply and some springs are of historical and tourism value. However, increasing industrial and urban expansion has led to serious problems of overdraft of groundwater resources, which in turn had caused the disappearance of springs globally. Thus, the protection of springs while at the same time allowing for the use of local groundwater resources is an important task of water resources management. In this study, we propose a new multi-objective simulation and optimization (S/O) model to find an optimal extraction strategy which balances the competitive relationship between spring outflow and groundwater extraction. In the newly developed model, the extraction rates of different groundwater wells are taken as the decision variables, and maximization of groundwater extraction and maximization of spring outflow are taken as the two objective functions. Baotu Spring which is located in northern China has been famous since the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE). However, Baotu Spring has been drying up since the 1990s due to over extraction of the local groundwater. Thus, we take Baotu Spring as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed model. Simultaneously, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the multi-objective fast harmony search algorithm (MOFHS) which is coupled with the commonly used groundwater flow code MODFLOW, is adopted to search the Pareto optimal solutions (the optimal extraction strategies). The optimization results of Baotu Spring field during the management period from July 2013 to June 2014 show that more groundwater resources could be extracted without threatening the sustainable outflow of Baotu Spring and Black Tiger Spring. The optimization results for different hydrological years show that climate variability (mainly in precipitation) is an important factor when choosing the optimal extraction strategy. The optimization results of Baotu Spring in northern China show that the newly developed model is a promising tool to find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies which can protect springs while maximizing the extraction of groundwater resources in a spring field.",
2894,"Modelling groundwater levels in an urban coastal aquifer using artificial neural networks The prediction of groundwater levels in a basin is of immense importance for the management of groundwater resources, especially in coastal regions where the water table fluctuations are to be limited to avoid seawater intrusion. In this paper, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology is presented to predict groundwater levels in individual wells with one month lead. Groundwater levels were also predicted in neighboring wells using model parameters from the best network of a well. This methodology is applied to an urban coastal aquifer in Andhra Pradesh state, India. The results suggest that the feed forward neural network with Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm is a good choice for predicting groundwater levels in individual wells. Bayesian Regularization (BR) model parameters of Balaji Nagar well are also used successfully to predict groundwater levels in the study area. It was observed that the ANN-based algorithms were a better choice for the prediction of groundwater levels with limited hydrological parameters. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
2895,"Sex-specific patterns and deregulation of endocrine pathways in the gene expression profiles of Bangladeshi adults exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking water Arsenic contamination of drinking water occurs globally and is associated with numerous diseases including skin, lung and bladder cancers, and cardiovascular disease. Recent research indicates that arsenic may be an endocrine disruptor. This study was conducted to evaluate the nature of gene expression changes among males and females exposed to arsenic contaminated water in Bangladesh at high and low doses. Twenty-nine (55% male) Bangladeshi adults with water arsenic exposure ranging from 50 to 1000 Î¼g/L were selected from the Folic Acid Creatinine Trial. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix 1.0 ST arrays. Differentially expressed genes were assessed between high and low exposure groups for males and females separately and findings were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. There were 534 and 645 differentially expressed genes (p<0.05) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of males and females, respectively, when high and low water arsenic exposure groups were compared. Only 43 genes overlapped between the two sexes, with 29 changing in opposite directions. Despite the difference in gene sets both males and females exhibited common biological changes including deregulation of 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes, deregulation of genes downstream of Sp1 (specificity protein 1) transcription factor, and prediction of estrogen receptor alpha as a key hub in cardiovascular networks. Arsenic-exposed adults exhibit sex-specific gene expression profiles that implicate involvement of the endocrine system. Due to arsenic's possible role as an endocrine disruptor, exposure thresholds for arsenic may require different parameters for males and females.",
2896,"Protection of sodium arsenite-induced ovarian toxicity by coadministration of L-ascorbate (vitamin C) in mature wistar strain rat Arsenic, a major water pollutant in India, produces toxic effects on female reproductive system in rodent models at the dose available in drinking water in arsenic-intoxicated zones. This study examines the coadministration of L-ascorbate (vitamin C) on ovarian steroidogenesis, plasma levels of gonadotrophins, brain monoamines, and ovarian as well as uterine peroxidase activities in sodium arsenite-treated rats. After sodium arsenite treatment, relative ovarian and uterine weights, ovarian Delta5-3beta-HSD and 17beta-HSD activities, plasma levels of gonadotrophins, norepinephrine levels in midbrain and diencephalon, and the activities of peroxidase in ovary and uterus were decreased significantly. On the other hand, serotonin levels in midbrain and diencephalon were increased significantly 28 days after sodium arsenite treatment at the dose of 0.4 ppm/100 g body weight/rat/day. All these parameters were protected significantly and in most cases were unchanged from control level when L-ascorbate at 25 mg/100 g body weight/rat/day was coadministered orally with sodium arsenite. This cotreatment of L-ascorbate with sodium arsenite also restored the estrous cycle in a regular manner. We concluded that L-ascorbate plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal ovarian activities and brain monoamines in arsenic-treated rats.",
2897,"A Pathway-based Analysis of Urinary Arsenic Metabolites and Skin Lesions Inorganic arsenic is metabolized to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Limited evidence suggests that the ability to fully metabolize arsenic into DMA influences susceptibility to disease. To determine whether percentage of MMA was predictive of disease, the authors used data from a case-control study conducted in Bangladesh (2001-2003). Persons who were diagnosed with keratosis, melanosis, Bowen's disease, or squamous cell carcinoma were matched on age, sex, and village to persons without these conditions. This analysis was restricted to persons who had no missing data on covariates (859 cases, 868 controls). A path analysis was used to evaluate simultaneously the association between the percentage of all urinary arsenic metabolites and the odds of skin lesions using PROC CALIS in SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and Mplus, version 6.1 (Muthen & Muthen, Los Angeles, California). The odds of skin lesions were significantly associated with log(10) percentage of MMA (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 2.12) but not log(10) percentage of inorganic arsenic (ORadj = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.50) or log(10) percentage of DMA (ORadj = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.33, 3.46). This novel analysis confirmed that persons who excrete a higher proportion of MMA have a greater risk of skin lesions after data are adequately controlled for urinary arsenic metabolites, current arsenic exposure, and other risk factors.",
2898,"On Fluid and Thermal Dynamics in a Heterogeneous CO2 Plume Geothermal Reservoir CO2 is now considered as a novel heat transmission fluid to extract geothermal energy. It can achieve both the energy exploitation and CO2 geological sequestration. The migration pathway and the process of fluid flow within the reservoirs affect significantly a CO2 plume geothermal (CPG) system. In this study, we built three-dimensional wellbore-reservoir coupled models using geological and geothermal conditions of Qingshankou Formation in Songliao Basin, China. The performance of the CPG system is evaluated in terms of the temperature, CO2 plume distribution, flow rate of production fluid, heat extraction rate, and storage of CO2. For obtaining a deeper understanding of CO2-geothermal system under realistic conditions, heterogeneity of reservoir's hydrological properties (in terms of permeability and porosity) is taken into account. Due to the fortissimo mobility of CO2, as long as a highly permeable zone exists between the two wells, it is more likely to flow through the highly permeable zone to reach the production well, even though the flow path is longer. The preferential flow shortens circulation time and reduces heat-exchange area, probably leading to early thermal breakthrough, which makes the production fluid temperature decrease rapidly. The analyses of flow dynamics of CO2-water fluid and heat may be useful for future design of a CO2-based geothermal development system.",
2899,"Evaluation of Coal Bump Risk During Underground Mining: A Case Study of Tabas Coal Mine Coal bump is one of the most important hazards for underground miners due to occurrence without warning. This hazard leads to the problems in the form of injury, disability or fatality as well as economic loss for the mining companies. As a result, development of a model for risk analysis of coal bump is an important issue in safety of underground coal mining. Although the mechanism of the bump is not well understood, it is found that stress condition is strongly associated with the coal bump. In this research, a numerical model is developed for analyzing of coal bump risk to map the zones with a high risk in Tabas Coal Mine, Iran. Results show that the concentration of the abutment stress that could lead to a coal bump starts at more than 25m in front of the mining face and increases nearer the face. Moreover, stress concentration starts to accelerate at a distance of 10m ahead of the mining face. Large and rapid stress concentration is a distinct precursor of coal bump occurrence during longwall mining. Therefore, zones at a distance less than 10m in front of the face are predicted as the bump-prone zones. The mentioned zones that moved ahead of the mining face must be considered in the mine risk analysis plan. The numerical results were validated against the monitoring data collected to measure the roof displacement in the mine roadways and confirm that prediction of the coal bump by this approach is accurate and satisfied.",
2900,"Arsenic and other trace elements contamination in groundwater and a risk assessment study for the residents in the Kandal Province of Cambodia Concentrations of arsenic and other trace elements in groundwater were examined at three villages (PT, POT and CHL) in the Kandal Province of Cambodia. Concentrations of arsenic in the groundwater ranged from 6.64 (in POT village) to 1543 mu g/L (in PT village), with average and median concentrations of 552 and 353 mu g/L, respectively. About 86% out of fifteen samples contained arsenic concentrations exceeding the WHO drinking water guidelines of 10 mu g/L Concentrations of arsenic (III) varied from 4 (in POT village) to 1334 mu g/L (in PT village), with an average concentration of 470 mu g/L In addition, about 67%, 80% and 86% of the groundwater samples had higher concentrations for. respectively, barium, manganese and lead than the WHO drinking water guidelines. These results reveal that groundwater in Kandal Province is not only considerably contaminated with arsenic but also with barium, manganese and lead. A risk assessment study found that one sample (PT25) had a cumulative arsenic concentration (6758 mg) slightly higher than the threshold level (6750 mg) that could cause internal cancer in smelter workers with chronic exposure to arsenic from groundwater. High cumulative arsenic ingestion poses a health threat to the residents of Kandal Province. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2901,"Risk assessment of three fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the groundwater recharge system Three fluoroquinolone antibiotics agents (FQs) in groundwater and reclaimed water have been investigated in Changzhou and Beijing, China. The occurrence of ofloxacin (OFL), enrofloxacin (ENR) and norfloxacin (NOR) is in nanograms per liter and has 100% frequency. The concentration order of FQs in reclaimed water is NOR>OFL>ENR, whilst the order in groundwater is NOR>ENR>OFL. And then the single and mixture adsorption-desorption have been studied and showed that (i) silty clay loam has higher sorption capacity than loamy sand, (ii) competitive adsorption exists when the three selected FQs coexist, (iii) ENR has a significantly priority sorption to NOR, whilst OFL has a least sorption among the mixture, (iv) there is no significant difference between the desorption results of mixture and the indivdual compound in relatively low concentration, (v) the formed chemical bonds and the irreversible combination of adsorption point are the significant influential factors for explaining desorption hysteresis of the selected FQs. Based on the above study, transport model and risk quotient have been performed, and the calculated risk quotient reveals that: (i) the selected FQs risk order in reclaimed water is OFL>ENR>NOR, (ii) in groundwater, OFL and ENR pose a higher risk than NOR no matter whether considering the long time groundwater recharge. This study will help policy makers to decide which FQs need to be covered in the priority substance lists defined in legislative frameworks.",
2902,"In situ measurement of an emerging persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) substance - Melamine and related triazines in waters by diffusive gradient in thin-films Melamine has received increasing public attention as a persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) substance. To better assess environmental exposure and risks of melamine and related triazines (cyromazine, ammeline, and atrazine), a new passive sampling method based on the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique has been developed and validated in this study. The studied triazines were adsorbed quickly and strongly by the selected mixed cation exchange (MCX) binding gels. This MCX-DGT can linearly accumulate these chemicals over at least 5 days, with neither significant individual influence from pH (6-8), ionic strength (0.01-0.5Â M) or dissolved organic matter (0-10Â M), or interaction effects. Field applications in Southern China showed that DGT performed well in both sewage treatment plant (STP) and river samples. Melamine was found to be the dominant triazine with the concentrations at Î¼gÂ·L(-1) in the STP and receiving river. Surprisingly, much higher concentration of melanine was found in the STP effluent than influent, and appeared to be some of the highest concentrations reported in STPs worldwide to date. Comparable melamine and atrazine concentraions in the STP effluent and receiving river suggested other sources to the river. The MCX-DGT sampler developed here was demonstrated to be reliable and robust for measuring the triazines in waters, and is promising as an in situ tool in understanding the occurrence, sources, and fate of the emerging PMT substances in aquatic environment.",
2903,"Estimating previous exposure to arsenic for populations living in parts of Hungary, Romania and Slovakia Arsenic Health Risk Assessment and Molecular Epidemiology (ASHRAM) is a large EU-funded case-control study looking at risk of cancer (bladder, kidney and skin) due to arsenic in drinking water. The ASHRAM project is specifically concerned with populations residing in parts of Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. In these districts, many incidences of exposure to arsenic (As) have occurred in the recent past. However, some populations are continuing to experience exposure to relatively low-level arsenic concentrations in their drinking water. In order to calculate risk of cancer, it is necessary to estimate cumulative arsenic dose by reconstructing individual exposure histories due to water consumed both at home and in the workplace. In this study, data on water consumption was obtained using questionnaire tools. Concentrations of arsenic in water supplies were measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). Measurements of total inorganic arsenic in the urine of the participants were made as a biomarker for current exposure. Preliminary results indicate that on average people are drinking 1.76 L/d from tap sources. Initial analysis suggests that the volume of water consumed by individuals has changed little with time, while the majority of people drink between 10 and 25% of their water at work. These estimates seem plausible and similar to other estimates.",
2904,"WATER RESOURCES IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBALIZATION A rational use can lead to the protection of water resources. In a community, the state of the environment is influenced by both the quality and the quantity of water resources. The state of the environment is also given by measures to protect water resources in other areas such as energy, transport, agriculture, fisheries and tourism. The supply of drinking water is influenced by water quality. A prudent and rational use of natural resources, including water resources, can help preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment. Water management and use of water resources are very important. The importance is the multiple use of water. This may lead to deterioration in the qualitative parameters of water resources. This raises the issue of implementing rehabilitation and development measures for wastewater management systems. The application of modern and non-polluting technologies can lead to pollution prevention. In many areas, it is used in addition to surface water and groundwater. From this point of view, the article presents an analysis of the quality of surface waters and groundwater. Globalization has favoured technological transfer from developed countries to developing countries. Given the economic development of a country, globalization has made the role of human capital grow. It also had an effect on competitiveness. The article presents the evolution of the population served by the public water supply system, respectively the quantity of drinking water distributed to the consumers. In a globalized economy, increasing competitiveness is based on knowledge.",
2905,"Effect of Irrigation Method on Adaptation Capacity of Rice to Climate Change in Subtropical India Water management technologies under projected climate change will play key role in sustainable rice production. Modeling approach was used to assess the impact of climate change on rice production under drip irrigation (DIR) and conventional puddle transplanted (PTR) in subtropical India. The genotype coefficients of CERES-Rice model (cv. Naveen) were determined and tested using experimental data for the years 2012-2014. Close match between the observed and simulated values was recorded during both the years which led to higher d-index (>0.95) and lower normalized RMSE (RMSEn) values. Under the projected climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), grain yield reduced over the period 2020-2080, with higher decline in RCP 8.5. Over the period, higher nitrogen (N) use efficiency in DIR led to lower yield reduction over PTR. Among the different adaptation measures, higher fertilizer N dose was able to mitigate negative impact of temperature rise up to 3.3 degrees C over base period, beyond which grain yield was significantly reduced. Results of the simulations for the different sowing dates stated higher reduction in grain yield with delayed sowing in DIR as well as in PTR for both (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) climate change scenarios. However, early sowing resulted in better crop establishment in DIR leading to better yield compared to PTR in both the climate change scenarios.",
2906,"Sorption of anionic and cationic dyes on millet seed envelope from aqueous solution This study consists of testing the sorption capacity of Methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) on a plant substrate prepared from millet seed envelope (MSE). The solid recovered after each experiment (MSE/MB and MSE/CR) is used as a new adsorbent for second sorption. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, iodine number, and the point of zero charge determination are used for the characterization of the MSE. The effect of several operating conditions such as contact time, adsorbent dose, pH, initial concentration, and temperature on sorption is investigated. Characterization of the MSE powder showed the presence of several cavities, capillaries, and oxygenated groups distributed over a heterogeneous surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis revealed that aluminum is the most dominant element. The pH(PZC) value of the sorbent surface is around 6.00. Sorption tests of MB and CR on MSE, MSE/MB, and MSE/CR showed that sorption kinetics is quite fast with an equilibrium contact time of 60 min for the three adsorbents. Sorption kinetics of MB and CR on MSE and MSE recovered is well-described by the pseudo-second-order model. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were found to describe well the sorption of the dyes studied. The determined Langmuir sorption capacities are 111.11 and 94.34 mg/g of MB onto MSE and MSE/CR, respectively, 158.73, and 169.49 mg/g of CR onto MSE and MSE/MB, respectively. The study of the effect of temperature showed that the uptake of MB and CR on MSE is an exothermic process.",
2907,"Is Prudhoe Bay natural gas a viable source of methanol for the US? The preferred method of manufacturing methanol is by starting with natural gas and using a one or two step process, ending up with the desired liquid methanol. A few years ago a physically large, two-step process based on ICI, Lurgi or Haldor-Topsoe Technology was preferred, but now a simpler, more compact process using a catalyst slurry appears to have significant advantages. Besides the production of methanol, we should also consider its transportation to markets, and we shall discuss one aspect of that in this paper. In contrast to gaseous methane, the major constituent of most natural gas, methanol is a liquid which does not freeze until a very low temperature. It is essentially non-corrosive for most, steel and hence can be transported in ordinary steel pipelines and tankers. It is well known in the petroleum industry that the throughput of the Alyeska Pipeline is decreasing rapidly with time because the oil production from the main Sadlerochit reservoir is doing so. Oil production from other reservoirs on the North Slope has not been sufficient to make up for this decline. In our earlier work we thoroughly considered the manufacture of petrochemical plants on large barges in industrialized areas such as the U.S., Japan, Korea or Europe, and then moving these to offshore of the North Slope during the brief Arctic summer. These plants could be operated on the barges rather than being disassembled and moved ashore. The buoyancy tanks of the barges could be used as storage tanks for process water and product methanol. The technology of constructing Various kinds of equipment on barges is well developed. We now consider the significant advantages of using the newer slurry catalyst process equipment. both because of its higher reported efficiency and also because of its compactness. The competing markets for methanol are not considered here.",
2908,"Prevalence and molecular characterisation of Schistosoma haematobium among primary school children in Kebbi State, Nigeria Schistosomiasis is the major source of morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. It is estimated that 207 million people are infected, of which 97% are in Africa. The aim of this study was the determining of prevalence as well as the phylogeny of S. haematobium among school children in Argungu Emirate, Kebbi State Nigeria. A total of 325 urine samples was collected from school children between 7 to 14 years. S. heamatobium eggs was examined under dissecting microscope and DNA was extracted from urine sample and COX1 gene was amplified by nested PCR. The PCR products were purified, sequenced and analysed. This study showed a prevalence of 32.09%, with male pupils having the highest prevalence. S. haematobium infections in children who fetch water in the river have 24 times higher risk of being infected while those who bath in the river have 158 times higher risk of being infected. Our sequences were phylogenetically related to S. haematobium isolate U82266 from Kenya and consistence with the predominant species in Africa. This was the first S. haematobium and S. mansoni co-infection reported in Nigeria. S. haematobium infection is prevalent among school age and significantly associated with water contact.",
2909,"[Investigation of nitrogen, phosphorus and microbial contamination in Laolongdong underground river system of Chongqing] With urbanization, groundwater in China has been widely polluted. Karst groundwater is important in southwest China, and would be difficult to recover once contaminated. NO3(-), PO4(3), NH4(+), total coliform, total E. coli and fecal coliform were chosen as indexes in the study of groundwater of Laolongdong Underground River System in Nanshan Mountain, Chongqing. After a few years of survey, the results showed that NO3(-), NH4(+) and PO4(3-) concentrations in the water were all above the nature value, especially NH4(+) and PO4(3-). The NO3(-) concentration of Guihuawan spring ranged from 19.78-68.55 mg x L(-1), in some months, above the recommended water quality guideline (50 mg x L(-1)) according to Standards for Drinking Water Quality set by World Health Organization. NH4(+) and PO4(3-) concentrations in Laolongdong underground river varied from 2.71-12.92 mg x L(-1) and 0.16-11.22 mg x L(-1). The NO3(-) concentration in Laolongdong underground river was lower than in karst spring; however, the concentrations of NH4(+) and PO4(3-) were higher than in the spring. It seemed that the NO3(-) concentration tended to decrease from 2008 to 2013 in the underground river caused by urbanization, reduction of farmland and reducing environment. However, waste water with a high PO4(3-) concentration led to an increasing trend in the PO4(3-) concentration in underground river. Microbial contamination was extremely serious, and even far exceeded class V of water quality standards of China. For example, the concentration of fecal coliform in the groundwater ranged from 3.4 x 10(4)-3.68 x 10(4) CFU x mL(-1). Because of the special hydrogeological structure, karst depressions, skylights and sinkholes can lead pollutants easily to the underground water. Agriculture activity, sewage from towns, enterprises and residential areas were the major sources of nitrogen, phosphorus and microbial contamination.",
2910,"Factors of runoff generation in the Dongting Lake basin based on a SWAT model and implications of recent land cover change The Dongting Lake basin in China has been changed substantially by human activity. Environmental issues like land reclamation, land cover change, flood and droughts and the effects of climate change call for a deep understanding of the hydrological system to enable stakeholders to plan mitigation and adaptation strategies. For this study a SWAT model of the watershed was created and calibrated to the runoff of the four main tributaries. The simulated reaction of the computational units (HRU) to rainfall was then linked to the physical attributes that defined the respective HRU to find the main effects of runoff generation. The results showed that surface runoff and Evapotranspiration are mainly determined by land cover under the same rainfall conditions, while interflow and ground water flow also depend on slope angle. Soil effects were minor due to the utilized soil data. Recent land cover change as detected from Landsat scenes of the years 2000 and 2013 has brought an increase in the forested area in the Dongting basin, especially on higher slope inclinations. This increase led to an increase in interflow and ground water flow, slowing down the overall response of the basin to rainfall. This balances the discharge between periods with high and low rainfall and helps to mitigate flood and drought severity. Cross effects between the factors, the size of the research area and the quality of input data were limiting factors of the used method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.",
2911,"Mistletoe leaves as a biosorbent for removal of Pb(II) and Cd(II) from aqueous solution The adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) ions onto the biosorbent from leaves of Ramus Loranthi, Scurrula Parasitica L., family Loranthaceae, commonly known as mistletoe or Tam gui in Vietnam, (henceforth to be referred as mistletoe leaves) was studied. The results showed that adsorption equilibrium was established in 150min of contact time. The maximum adsorption for both metals obtained was at pH 5.5. The time-dependent experimental data of Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption process well fitted the pseudo-second-order model. The Redlich-Peterson, Toth, and Langmuir models were appropriate to describe the adsorption process, indicating the chemisorption process onto mistletoe leaves. The maximum adsorbent capacity was increased with an increase in temperature. It was found to be 44.8, 47.85, 49.1, and 50.07mg/g for Cd(II) and 59.76, 63.25, 66.3, and 68.53mg/g for Pb(II) at 303, 308, 313, and 318K, respectively. The positive value of H indicated the endothermic adsorption process. The high adsorption capacity for Pb(II) and Cd(II) obtained in this study shown that mistletoe leaves are a potential biosorbent for removal of these metals from wastewater and contaminated water.",
2912,"Drought and weir construction impact stationarity assumption in watershed water quality modeling in South Korea Existing watershed water quality models assume that the physio-biochemical processes affecting water quality variables are stationary. Using Hydrologic Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) parameterized before drought and weir construction, this study investigates if this assumption is valid in the model used for simulating water quality variables after drought and weir construction. The study area is located in South Korea, where tremendous ecological stress occurred following a drought and the completion of weir construction in 2012. To assess model performance and explore temporal changes in water quality variables, various goodness-of-fit measures and wavelet analyses are used. This study indicates that drought is the dominant stressor on water quality, and the co-occurring impact of weir construction is not discernible. Drought and weir construction cause nonstationary temporal changes in individual water quality variables and in their interrelationships, for example, dependence of dissolved oxygen on water temperature. This study demonstrated that the stationarity assumption implicit in the model parameterized under a non-drought condition is not valid during a drought condition. As a result, the model performance degrades when simulating drought-influenced physio-biochemical processes of water quality variables. The HSPF model lacks functionality for translating temporal changes in water temperature into kinetic parameters that govern biochemical processes of various water quality variables. Wavelet analysis is a good tool for elucidating unique aspects of nonstationary temporal change at various temporal scales, especially for recognizing algal succession pattern changes and identifying nonstationary relationships between any two variables.",
2913,"An African account of ecosystem service provision: Use, threats and policy options for sustainable livelihoods Scientific work on ecosystem services has been growing globally as well as in Africa. Human dependence on provisioning ecosystem services in particular is mostly acknowledged in developing countries like those in Africa, where many people are poor and reliant on natural resources. The reliance of communites on natural resources in Africa varies from place to place as aridity, vegetation and socio-economic conditions change. In the humid and forested areas in the west and central parts of Africa, food and raw materials coupled with agriculture are important ecosystem services while in the dryer arid and semi-arid countries in southern and northern Africa, tourism, water and grazing are priorities. Overexploitation of resources coupled with large scale agriculture threatens both ecosystem services and livelihoods. The need to safeguard ecosystem services is urgent. There are some efforts to safeguard ecosystem services in Africa. However, realizing benefits to livelihoods still faces serious challenges due to climata change, recent land grabbing and urbanization. The challenges are compounded by the land tenure situation in Africa. Whilst policy goals have been established at both the international and national levels the implementation of such polices and likelihood of them leading to sustainable land management for delivery of ecosystem services remains a key challenge.

2914,"Adsorption of arsenite using natural laterite as adsorbent Arsenite removal capacity of natural laterite (NL), collected from Kharagpur, in the district of Midnapore, West Bengal, India, has been investigated. Effects of adsorbent dose, operating pH, contact time, initial arsenite concentration, adsorbent particle size, etc. on the removal of arsenite are examined. Kinetic study in agitated baffled vessel reveals that uptake of As(III) ions is rapid in the first two hours and slows down thereafter. Maximum removal efficiency of As(III) achieved is 98% at an adsorbent dose of 40 g/l with initial As(III) concentration of 1000 mu g/l in batch studies and 94% at 20 g/l absorbent dose under the same conditions. Equilibrium time is almost independent of initial arsenite concentration. Equilibrium studies show that As(III) ions have high affinity towards NL even at very low concentration of arsenite. In speciation study, about 20% conversion to As(V) from As(III) is observed, with initial As(III) concentration of 1000 mu g/l and at 20 g/l adsorbent dose. Thermodynamic parameters depicted the endothermic nature of adsorption. The results suggest that NL could be used as effective filter medium for removal of As(III) ions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

2915,"Study of uranium isotopic composition in groundwater and deviation from secular equilibrium condition Uranium concentration in groundwater reflect both redox conditions and uranium content in host rock. In the present study an attempt has been made to study the uranium concentration and activity ratios of uranium isotopes to present the geochemical conditions of the groundwater in Malwa region of Punjab state, India and the reason for high uranium levels and variation of activity ratios from secular equilibrium conditions. Uranium concentration in groundwater samples was found to be in the range of 13.9 +/- A 1.2 to 172.8 +/- A 12.3 mu g/l with an average value of 72.9 mu g/l which is higher than the national and international guideline values. On the basis of uranium concentration, the groundwater of the study region may be classified as oxidized aquifer on normal uranium content strata (20 %) or oxidized aquifer on enhanced uranium content strata (80 %). The U-238, U-235 and U-234 isotopic concentration in groundwater samples was found to be in the range of 89.2-1534.5, 4.4-68.5, and 76.4-1386.2 mBq/l, respectively. Activity ratios of U-234/U-238 varies from 0.94 to 1.85 with a mean value of 1.11 which is close to unity that shows secular equilibrium condition. High value of U-234 isotope than U-238 may be due to alpha recoil phenomenon. The plot of AR of U-234/U-238 against the total uranium content in log scale reveals that the groundwaters of the study region either belongs to stable accumulation or normal oxidized aquifer.",
2916,"Shallow Shear-Wave Velocity Structure beneath the West Lake Area in Hangzhou, China, from Ambient-Noise Tomography Urban geophysical exploration plays an important role in the sustainable development of and the mitigation of geological hazards in metropolitan areas. However, it is not suitable to implement active seismic methods in densely populated urban areas. The rapidly developing ambient-noise tomography (ANT) method is a promising technique for imaging the near-surface seismic velocity structure. We selected the West Lake area of the city of Hangzhou as a case study to probe the shallow subsurface shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure using ANT. We conducted seismic interferometry on the ambient-noise data recorded by 28 seismograph stations during a time period of 17 days. Fundamental-mode Rayleigh-wave group- and phase-velocity dispersion data were measured from cross-correlation functions and then inverted for a 3D Vs model of the uppermost 1 km that covers an area of about 7 km x 8 km. The tomographic results reveal two prominent anomalies, with high velocities in the southwest and low velocities in the northeast. The fast anomaly corresponds to the presence of limestone and sandstone, whereas the slow anomaly is due to the relatively low-velocity rhyolite and volcanic tuff in the area. The boundary between the two anomalies lies to the NE of an NW-SE trending fault, indicating that the fault dips toward the NE. In addition, the pronounced low-velocity anomalies appear under the Baoshi mountain, likely due to the thick rhyolite and volcanic tuff beneath the extinct volcano. Our results correlate well with regional geological features and suggest that ANT could be a promising technique for facilitating the exploration of urban underground space.",

The TBM First Wall (FW) and the Lead-Lithium Cooling System (LLCS) is cooled by high-pressure helium gas system. The conceptual design of LLCB concept as a test blanket module (TBM) for ITER has been approved in 2017. Helium Cooling System (HCS) is one of the major ancillary system has been designed for this concept. In the conceptual design of the LLCB Test Blanket System (TBS), two separate helium cooling loop have been considered for extracting heat from the test blanket. One helium coolant loop for extracting heat from the TBM FW and the other one from the LLCS. It is, however, found that installation and commissioning of the components of two high-pressure helium systems and the coolant purification system in the allocated space of Tokamak Cooling Water System (TCWS) Vault Annex (VA) is very challenging and the existing ancillary systems need to be optimized and made more compact. In view of this, studies have been carried out to optimize the process parameters, size of components, and the configuration of the helium system. In parallel, design optimization of TBM FW has also been carried out and several combinations of channel sizes, profile, and helium flow rate have been studied. This paper presents a new design configuration for the helium cooling system of the LLCB TBM. In this design, a single helium cooling loop has been devised complying with the cooling requirements of both the TBM first wall and the lead-lithium system. The main components and piping of the helium cooling system have been modelled in the modified version of RELAP/MOD4.0 and a preliminary transient analysis is carried out. In this paper, the process parameters, the process and instrumentations details, features of the new configuration, and the results of RELAP analysis of the helium cooling system are presented. The results of the thermo-hydraulic analysis of the TBM first wall with the optimized flow rate are also discussed.",
2918,"Association of low-level arsenic exposure in drinking water with cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and risk assessment The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing an integrated assessment of non-cancer and cancer risk assessment of inorganic arsenic (iAs). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in association with iAs exposure has been examined in a number of studies and provides a basis for evaluating a reference dose (RfD) for assessing potential non-cancer health risks of arsenic exposure. In this systematic review of low-level iAs exposure (i.e., <100-150 mu g/L arsenic water concentration) and CVD in human populations, 13 cohort and case-control studies from the United States, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and China were identified and critically examined for evidence for derivation of a RfD. Eight cross-sectional and ecological studies from the United States were also examined for additional information. Prospective cohort data from Bangladesh provided the strongest evidence for determining the point of departure in establishing a candidate RID based on a combined endpoint of mortality from ""ischemic heart disease and other heart diseases."" This study as well as the overall literature supported a no-observed-adverse-effect level of 100 mu g/L for arsenic in water, which was equivalent to an iAs dose of 0.009 mg/kg-day (based on population-specific water consumption rates and dietary iAs intake). The study population was likely sensitive to arsenic toxicity because of nutritional deficiencies affecting arsenic methylation and one-carbon metabolism, as well as increasing CVD risk. Evidence is less clear on the interaction of CVD risk factors in the United States (e.g., diabetes, obesity, and hypertension) with arsenic at low doses. Potential uncertainty factors up to 3 resulted in a RfD for CVD in the range of 0.003-0.009 mg/kg-day. Although caution should be exercised in extrapolating these results to the U.S. general population, these doses allow a margin of exposure that is 10-30 times the current RID derived by EPA (based on skin lesions in Southwest Taiwan). These findings suggest that the current EPA RID is protective of CVD. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",
2919,"Early warning of water quality degradation: A copula-based Bayesian network model for highly efficient water quality risk assessment In the context of global climate change and increasingly severe environmental pollution, drinking water quality risk assessments to provide crucial early warnings have become essential routine work. At present, traditional water quality assessment methods are commonly used without considering the correlation among different indicators and the substantial uncertainty from multiple sources, which limit their applications. To address this issue, a copula-based Bayesian network (CBN) method was proposed in this study to concretely evaluate the water quality risk with multiple environmental risk indicators in a large drinking water reservoir in Tianjin city, China. Taking rainfall and water temperature (WT) as external environmental risk indicators and pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH(3)-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and permanganate index (COD(Mn)) as internal environmental risk indicators, the CBN model was constructed to investigate the interaction between the indicators and water quality state and assess the contingent risk. Our results showed that TN and NH(3)-N should be considered key risk indicators. Additionally, we performed forward and backward risk analyses to assess water quality risk during different seasons and determined the distributions of key indicators under different water quality risk grades. From a time perspective, the reservoir's water quality risk is much higher in winter and spring than in other seasons affected by winter snowfall. From a spatial perspective, the water quality risk is much higher at the reservoir's entrance than at other locations affected by water diversion. Furthermore, we found that the probability of water quality risk events may be relatively high when the TN concentration is 3.6Â mg/L to 6.4Â mg/L at the reservoir's entrance. The results reveal that the CBN method could be an invaluable decision-support tool for reservoir managers and scientists, which could provide an early warning of water quality degradation by only inputting monitoring data.",
2920,"Distribution of suspended particulate matter at the equatorial transect in the Atlantic Ocean A suspended particulate matter distribution against a hydrographical background was studied at the oceanographic transect across the equatorial Atlantic in the year 2000. An area of abnormally high suspended matter volume concentrations was found above the Sierra Leone Rise in the entire water column (eastern part of the transect). The suggested explanation for the anomaly is based on the ballast hypothesis whereby solid particles are incorporated as ballast into suspended biogenic aggregates, leading to increased velocities of sinking. This occurs within the Northwest African upwelling area, where the plankton exposed to the Saharan dust abundance form a significant number of aggregates, which are later transported equatorward via the Canary Current. An intermediate nepheloid layer associated with the DeepWestern Boundary Current was recorded from the South American Slope at depths of 3200-3700 to 4300m above the Para Abyssal Plain. Antarctic Bottom Water enriched in suspended matter was found mostly in the troughs at 40-41 degrees W. It was detached from the bottom, coinciding with the core of the flow due to the bottom rise ""dam"" located up-stream. The grain size of particles along the entire transect has a polymodal distribution with 2-4 and 8-13 mu m modes. The registered rise in percentage in some parts of the transect of the 7-21 mu m sized particles suggests the presence of the well-known coarse mode (20-60 mu m) formed by aggregation of transparent exopolymer particles (mucus).",
2921,"An insight into the hydrological aspects of landslides of 2018 in Kodagu, South India The goal of the work has been to assess the factors that led to the series of landslides, which ravaged the District of Kodagu situated in the mountainous Western Ghats, in 2018. The work has been accomplished through field investigations and analysis of field data. While commonly, studies in India lay emphasis on the geological aspects and anthropogenic factors associated with landslides, the present work intended to study in detail the hydrological aspects of the disaster, which wreaked havoc in the region characterised by deep soils, very heavy rainfall and a dense vegetation cover. All the slides of significant magnitude along a 25-km stretch of the Payaswini valley, draining the western slopes of the Madikeri hill range, were identified, and their land characteristics delineated using field surveys and maps. Soil characteristics of the region were determined through tests on samples collected from ten slide sites. Results from tests on texture, density and permeability were used to learn about the part played by subsurface water. Characteristics of rainfall during the year were investigated using field data from the worst affected region. Studies on progress of the Monsoon rain, an analysis of probability of extreme values and establishment of intensity-duration relationships were accomplished. A variable source area watershed model incorporating MODFLOW, the popular ground water flow simulation model, has been applied on a typical micro-catchment in order to study the growth of the saturated zone during rains. It has been inferred from the investigations that an unprecedented combination of extremely wet catchment and a very heavy spell of rainfall, rather than any commonly attributed factor, has been the primary cause of the disaster in the district. It is concluded that it would be a futile exercise working on this natural phenomenon devoid of extensive field studies, because of the uniqueness of the region.",
2922,"A CORRELATION STUDY OF RADON IN DWELLINGS WITH RADIUM CONTENT OF SOIL Various national and international surveys have demonstrated an increase in radon (Rn) levels in dwellings and consequently there is a continuous growing concern about its health effects on the population. Rn progeny levels in dwellings are likely to be a multiple of outdoor levels. The main sources of indoor levels are the ground, the building materials, tap-water and domestic gas supplies. In houses with high concentration, the main source of Rn is the soil gas of the subjacent ground. Rn in soil gas depends on the radium content of the soil and the soil density. In India the first set of measurements were made in about 800 houses, which were identified as high background areas, and soils in these areas contain comparatively high levels of uranium and thorium. These measurements have given a geometric mean of 10.6 mWL for potential alpha energy concentration corresponding to a mean effective dose equivalent of 3.31 mSv. The second set of measurements consists of 1200 dwellings confining to mostly normal background areas. The measurements have given a mean value of 3.4 mWL corresponding to a dose equivalent of 1.16 mSv. The results of high background areas show about 2.8-fold increase compared to the background areas. The results of the soil radioactivity content in some high background areas when compared with the measured Rn levels in dwellings in nearby locations show that as soil activity increases, Rn levels tend to increase. In some cases a positive correlation has been obtained between Rn concentration in dwellings and the radium content of the soil. However, this trend is not observed always. This may be due to the influence of meteorological parameters, that affect the emanation rate. The relation between the emanation rate and the Rn and its progeny concentration in dwellings have been discussed.",
2923,"ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION OF THE SOIL EROSION RISK INFLUENCED BY THE URBANIZATION PROCESS WITHIN A COUNTY IN HILLY AREA OF SOUTHEAST CHINA, USING RUSLE AND CLUES MODEL Soil erosion by water is a well-known environmental problem. Urbanization is a worldwide trend, leading to a drastic change of land use forms in local areas, and change in soil erosion risks. This research analyzed the soil erosion risks in the past two decades of Zhuji County, which is located in hilly area of Southeast China and is experiencing fast urbanization process, to evaluate the influence of the urbanization on soil erosion using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Land use maps were developed by using CLUEs (the Conversion and Land Use and its Effect at Small regional extent) model to estimate the soil erosion risk in 3 different urbanization scenarios of 2020. The results showed that, during 1984 to 2009, as the percentage of the urban and built-up area increased from 0.43% to 10.95%, though the extreme erosion value did not have a clear trend, from 1984 to 2004, the percentage of area with soil erosion risk higher than medium level kept increasing from 3.23% to 6.34%, the percentage of area with tolerable soil erosion risk was decreasing from 71.57% to 67.58%. The scenario analysis showed that the change of the urban and built-up area would change the soil erosion risk significantly, especially the high and severe level erosion risk. Higher than medium level soil erosion risk is 7.49% in Scenario 1 with 15.33% urban and built-up area, 8.63% in Scenario 2 with 18.86% urban and built-up area, and 13.07% in Scenario 3 with 25% urban and built- up area. And the buffer zone analysis of a highway in the county also showed that the soil erosion risk correlated with the size of urban and built-up area. These results indicated that Zhuji County needs to pay more attention when urbanize in hilly area since it leads to more severe erosion risk without prevention measurements. And policies should balance the preservation of the agriculture land and the potential soil erosion risk during urbanization process.",
2924,"Influence of gold mine on groundwater quality (Efemcukuru, Izmir, Turkey) Currently, exploration of gold ores is under discussion in Turkey, without considering its adverse affect on the environment. Studying the adverse affect on environment is extremely important because significant civic activities are already taking place on the geological units that contain gold ore bodies in Turkey. Such an area is located at the southeast of Izmir City (Turkey), and approximately 2-km-long gold-bearing ore veins occur close to the Efemcukuru Village. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and seasonal variation of the groundwater chemistry and pollution of the aquifer in the ore deposit site, and to determine the impact of ore deposits on groundwater quality. The gold-bearing formation is highly weathered and fractured. The fractures in the geological units control the permeability and the depth of groundwater in the area, The concentrations of Al, Ag, Cu, Cd, Cr, Fe, Pb, Mn, Zn, Ni, and Sb were determined for four well samples and two stream waters for wet and dry seasons. The results showed that the concentrations of most of these elements were below the USA EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) limits; however, Pb and Cd concentrations are slightly above the limits. The results indicate that minerals in gold bodies do not dissolve although the weathering of formations is high. The low concentration of elements in groundwater and streams may be attributed to the high velocity of ground and surface water.",
2925,"Constituting fully integrated visual analysis system for Cu(II) on TiOâ‚‚/cellulose paper As a cheap and abundant porous material, cellulose filter paper was used to immobilize nano-TiO2 and denoted as TiO2/cellulose paper (TCP). With high adsorption capacity for Cu(II) (more than 1.65 mg), TCP was used as an adsorbent, photocatalyst, and colorimetric sensor at the same time. Under the optimum adsorption conditions, i.e., pH 6.5 and 25 Â°C, the adsorption ratio of Cu(II) was higher than 96.1%. Humic substances from the matrix could be enriched onto TCP but the interference of their colors on colorimetric detection could be eliminated by the photodegradation. In the presence of hydroxylamine, neocuproine, as a selective indicator, was added onto TCP, and a visual color change from white to orange was generated. The concentration of Cu(II) was quantified by the color intensity images using image processing software. This fully integrated visual analysis system was successfully applied for the detection of Cu(II) in 10.0 L of drinking water and seawater with a preconcentration factor of 10(4). The log-linear calibration curve for Cu(II) was in the range of 0.5-50.0 Î¼g L(-1) with a determination coefficient (R(2)) of 0.985 and its detection limit was 0.073 Î¼g L(-1).",
2926,"Review: Feed demand landscape and implications of food-not feed strategy for food security and climate change The food-feed competition is one of the complex challenges, and so are the ongoing climate change, land degradation and water shortage for realizing sustainable food production systems. By 2050 the global demand for animal products is projected to increase by 60% to 70%, and developing countries will have a lion's share in this increase. Currently, similar to 800 million tonnes of cereals (one-third of total cereal production) are used in animal feed and by 2050 it is projected to be over 1.1 billion tonnes. Most of the increase in feed demand will be in developing countries, which already face many food security challenges. Additional feed required for the projected increased demand of animal products, if met through food grains, will further exacerbate the food insecurity in these countries. Furthermore, globally, the production, processing and transport of feed account for 45% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector. This paper presents approaches for addressing these challenges in quest for making livestock sector more sustainable. The use of novel human-inedible feed resources such as insect meals, leaf meals, protein isolates, single cell protein produced using waste streams, protein hydrolysates, spineless cactus, algae, co-products of the biofuel industry, food wastes among others, has enormous prospects. Efficient use of grasslands also offers possibilities for increasing carbon sequestration, land reclamation and livestock productivity. Opportunities also exist for decreasing feed wastages by simple and well proven practices such as use of appropriate troughs, increase in efficiency of harvesting crop residues and their conversion to complete feeds especially in the form of densified feed blocks or pellets, feeding as per the nutrient requirements, among others. Available evidence have been presented to substantiate arguments that: (a) for successful and sustained adoption of a feed technology, participation of the private sector and a sound business plan are required, (b) for sustainability of the livestock production systems, it is also important to consider the consumption of animal products and a case has been presented to assess future needs of animal source foods based on their requirements for healthy living, (c) for dairy animals, calculation of Emission Intensity based on the lifetime lactation rather than one lactation may also be considered and (d) for assessment of the efficiency of livestock production systems a holistic approach is required that takes into consideration social dimensions and net human-edible protein output from the system in addition to carbon and water footprints.",
2927,"Waste Wash-Water Recycling in Ready Mix Concrete Plants The management of waste wash-water (WWW) is one of the most significant environmental problems associated with ready-mix concrete production worldwide. The problems are exacerbated should it be disposed of in an inappropriate manner. This study evaluated the potential of WWW recycling in ready mix concrete plants in Jordan. A representative waste wash-water sample (400 L) was collected from a basin in a ready-mix concrete company. A pilot plant on the lab scale was fabricated and installed. The treatment system consisted of a concrete washout reclaimer, wedgebed slurry settling pond, slow sand filtration unit, and a neutralization unit. Water samples were collected from all stages of the pilot plant and analyzed. The collected waste wash-water samples were utilized for replacement of well water (mixing water) at various ratios. Fourteen concrete mixtures were produced and cast, as well as tested at various curing ages (7, 28, and 90 days). The results show that the raw WWW was not acceptable as mixing water even after dilution as it led to significant reductions in concrete compressive strength and low workability. However, the WWW from the settling pond, the filtered WWW and the filtered-neutralized WWW at dilution ratios up to 75% were shown to be potential alternatives to fresh water for ready-mixed concrete. Therefore, the current guidelines for mixing water quality should be revised to encourage the reuse of the WWW.",
2928,"[Spatial Response of River Water Quality to Watershed Land Use Type and Pattern Under Different Rainfall Intensities] Qixiang River watershed, as a typical case study area, was divided into five types of buffer zones according to elevation and slope. Based on the remote sensing images, DEM and real-time monitoring data in April, May, June 2015, the relationship between land use type and pattern in all buffer zones and water quality under different rainfall intensities was explored. The results showed that land use type and pattern in different buffer zones had obvious discrepancies. The proportion of construction land was the highest in low flat area, secondary flat area and high flat area. The main land use type of moderately steep area and high steep area was forest land. Secondly, the low flat area appeared to have the greatest influence on the water quality. Thirdly, construction land had a greater influence on water quality than other land use types in low flat area. In addition, in secondary flat area, wetland was the key factor under small rainfall intensity. However, construction land was the key factor under moderate rainfall intensity and large rainfall intensity. In moderately steep area and high buffer zones, construction land influenced the water quality most under small rainfall intensity but forest land was the greatest factor under moderate rainfall intensity and large rainfall intensity. Fourthly, the relationship between the land use pattern and water quality was complicated. SH-MN had the greatest influence on water quality and the influence increased with increasing rainfall intensity in low flat area. Furthermore, PD, SH-MN and SHDI were the key factors in secondary flat area while SH-MN, SHDI and PD were the key factors in high flat area under all the three types of rainfall intensity. SH-MN and CONTAG influenced the water quality most in moderately steep area and high steep area under small and high rainfall intensity. CONTAG influenced the water quality most in moderately steep area and SHDI was the key factor in high steep area under moderate rainfall intensity.",
2929,"Conjunctive use of Inter-Basin Transferred and Desalinated Water in a Multi-Source Water Supply System Based on Cost-Benefit Analysis Water shortage has forced coastal cities to seek multi-source water supply with a focus on inter-basin water and desalinated seawater. The differences of water supply costs pose a challenge in the optimal use of multiple water resources. This paper aims to understand the impact of desalinated seawater's variable costs on multi-source water supply through a cost-benefit analysis method based on a multi-objective optimization model, considering different combination scenarios of desalination yield, streamflow condition, seawater desalting plant (SDP) scheme, water shortage index and utilization ratio of the SDP. The application in the coastal city Tianjin, China shows that the desalination yield has an impact on the tradeoff between the water shortage index and the total water supply cost and an optimal desalination yield can be determined at a turning point. And where the turning point appears is influenced by the utilization ratio of the SDP and streamflow conditions of inter-basin water. Moreover, a single centralized SDP is found to have an overall lower water supply cost than several decentralized small-sized SDPs. Lower water shortage index leads to higher cost, and the unit decrease of shortage index will need more added cost when the shortage index is very low. This method is proven to be effective in identifying the best conjunctive use of inter-basin water and desalinated seawater, which can contribute to relieve urban water shortage.",
2930,"Successional pathways of post-milpa fallows in Oaxaca, Mexico The milpa is a millennial agroecosystem commonly practiced in the Mesoamerica mountains. For soil recovery, the milpa depends on the fallows that develop in lands left unsown after the cultivation stage, but their successional dynamics are little known. We studied the successional dynamics of post-milpa fallows in the mountains of Mixteca Baja, north-western Oaxaca, Mexico, where this cropping system is common. We use the chronosequence approach in fallows ranging from approximate to 20 to 100 years old of three nearby watersheds that differ in their degree of exposure to Pacific Ocean winds, the leading source of rain and moisture. We analyzed information from field plots and unmanned aerial vehicle imagery to detect successional trends in milpa fallows. We find that around two decades after cultivation, the fallows are forests dominated by pines or alders. Plant density, vegetation cover, and diameter at breast height show little change afterward, suggesting that the forests reach a saturating point very early during succession. Subsequently, the main changes are in composition and diversity. Shade-tolerant species may replace pioneer species, species composition is moisture-related, and diversity shows contrasting patterns depending on the watershed. Old-growth vegetation is typically an oak forest in the driest watershed and a tropical montane cloud forest in the most humid. Species dominance tends to decrease with succession. beta-diversity is significant and can be ascribed to microclimate and successional processes associated with orography and the milpa practice. Older stands within the same watershed, tend to diverge in composition relative to younger stands, suggesting a lack of convergence towards a climax community. Combining young and old-growth forests might positively impact biodiversity and landscape resilience and helps explain the millennial persistence of milpas in Mesoamerica.",
2931,"Fluoride contributes to the shaping of microbial community in high fluoride groundwater in Qiji County, Yuncheng City, China As a toxic element, excessive amounts of fluoride in environment can be harmful because of its antimicrobial activity, however little is known about the relationship between fluoride and the bacterial community in groundwater systems. Here, we use samples from a typical fluorosis area to test the hypothesis that fluoride concentration is a fundamental structuring factor for bacterial communities in groundwater. Thirteen groundwater samples were collected; high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and statistical analysis were conducted to compare the bacterial community composition in individual wells. The results showed that Proteobacteria, with most relative abundance in groundwater, decreased along the groundwater fluoride concentration. Additionally, relative abundances of 12 families were also statistically correlated with fluoride concentration. The bacterial community was significantly explained by TOC (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.045) and fluoride concentration (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007) of groundwater. This suggests that fluoride and TOC likely plays an important role in shaping the microbial community structure in these groundwater systems. Our research suggest that fluoride concentration should be taken into consideration in future when evaluating microbial response to environmental conditions in groundwater system, especially for fluoride rich groundwater.",
2932,"Mission to Ethiopia (2006) The independent expert on minority issues, Gay McDougall visited Ethiopia from 28 November to 12 December 2006, in pursuance of her mandate. During her visit, she held numerous consultations in Addis Ababa, and undertook a visit to the Gambella region. She met with senior government officials at both the federal and state level, with civil society, academics and members of political opposition groups, with students, and with members of minority communities themselves. She held discussion forums, including with women from ethnic groups affected by conflict in the Gambella region. The Constitution of Ethiopia provides a comprehensive foundation for rights, freedoms, and equality. It offers a significant departure from the political visions of previous Governments, in which a single ethnic group dominated all others. The current constitutional scheme brings to the fore the civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural rights of the diverse ""nations, nationalities and peoples"" of Ethiopia. The rights of all ethnic communities to political representation in federal structures are established via the House of Federation, in which each ethnic group is guaranteed a seat. However, in some fundamental respects the true promise of the Constitution equal and effective participation of members of minority ethnic groups within a system of democratic decision-making - remains unfulfilled. Self-determination is provided for in the creation of nine ethnically based regional states of the federation, with the right to draft regional constitutions, to promulgate laws, to establish and administer government functions and to secede. The system. has enabled the use of minority languages, as official languages of the regional states, to be used in public education and by regional governmental institutions. Ethnically-based federalism has served, however, to politicize ethnicity as the most salient individual and group marker, leading to new arenas, dynamics and dimensions of ethnic division, discrimination and exclusion. Crucial checks and balances are required to ensure the democratic functioning of the federal system and to guarantee the rights of highly disadvantaged communities experiencing political, social and economic inequality. Continuing ethnic conflicts, often caused by land, water and resource issues, or due to political factors, are damaging prospects of regional stability, and a unified, democratic and prosperous Ethiopia. Concerted conflict prevention and resolution efforts are required, but to date have been inadequate. Minority communities that are discriminated against, excluded and marginalized are frequently victims of conflict, may be forcibly displaced from their traditional territories and lack opportunities and capacity to promote and protect their rights. Some communities, including pastoralist groups, face severe survival issues, extreme poverty and food and water insecurity on a daily basis. Some of the smallest communities in Ethiopia may disappear as distinct groups, due to environmental, social and political pressures and processes of assimilation. The independent expert is concerned by widespread perceptions, enhanced since the May 2005 elections and subsequent actions of the federal authorities, that a democratic deficit exists in Ethiopia that may lead to growing tensions and potential instability. Efforts are required on the part of the Government and at the state level to build confidence in democratic processes, ensure good governance, human rights, and fundamental freedoms. In this respect, credible guarantees that political parties can function freely, re-establishment of independent media freedoms and the release or fair trial of opposition members, academics, journalists and students currently detained, are essential measures that must be taken immediately.",
2933,"Delineating Reservoir Protection Areas through Spatial Analyses in Support of Water Quality Protection Developing water protection strategies to prevent drinking water sources from contamination is a high priority throughout the world. As a significant policy measure, the segmentation of the delineated watershed areas into several zones is implemented by defining areas closest to the intake and more distant areas. Article 8 of the Directive 80/778 relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption in the European Union for example, forces Member States to take measures for securing the quality of water while in some connected policy documents the rationale behind constructing safeguard zones with land-use restrictions are referred to this end. Due to the requirements set out in legislations, authorities responsible for protecting the water quality similarly apply some restrictions on collective settlements, industrial and agricultural developments particularly in the protection zones. Such restrictions have direct impacts on the social and economical activities of the population residing in the basin. Besides, descriptive differences between legislations from different levels or different practices performed by the different authorities lead to disparities between the basins that are subject to quite different protective measures and zoning systems in spite of their analogous basin characteristics. All such challenges and disputes in protection mostly relate to the lack of scientific basis of protection regulations that limits its qualification for being widely acceptable by and easily verifiable to the general public. The spatial approach presented in this study is implemented on a case-study selected from the Tahtali Catchment in the west of Turkey by addressing the above challenges arising from the current practices of reservoir protection while aiming at providing guidance for an alternative strategy to achieve a practical solution.",
2934,"Real textile effluents treatment using coagulation/flocculation followed by electrochemical oxidation process and ecotoxicological assessment As it is well known, the textile industry generates a large amount of wastewater with varied composition that need to be treated. In particular, the Sergipe state, in Brazil, is a region that requires attention due the presence of several local textile industries. In this study, the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation (EO) process applied in the samples of Brazilian textile industry effluents previously treated by physical-chemical process coagulation-flocculation (CF) was evaluated by the reduction in TOC parameter and by the ecotoxicity using Lactuca sativa and Raphidocelis subcapitata bioassays. The optimized experiments achieved for the CF ([Al(2)(SO(4))(3)](0)â€¯=â€¯1.5â€¯mgâ€¯L(-1), pHâ€¯=â€¯6.0, alkalinityâ€¯=â€¯0.675â€¯mgâ€¯L(-1), [flocculating agent]â€¯=â€¯61â€¯mgâ€¯L(-1), rapid mixingÂ =Â 100Â rpm for 1Â min, slow stageÂ =Â 20-60Â rpm for 20Â min) a reduction of 20% on TOC. The best results obtained for EO was using the DSA electrode (IÂ =Â 300Â mA) reaching a TOC removal efficiency of 82% after an electrolysis time of 180Â min. The ecotoxicity experiments indicated that the proposed treatment (CFÂ +Â EO, IÂ =Â 300Â mA) was effective to decrease the dissolved pollutants presented in the treated samples. In comparison with raw samples, the treatment achieved a reduction of 52% for IC50(72h) value using R. subcapitata as bioindicator, and a 98% reduction of LC(50) (Lactuca sativa).",
2935,"All Paths Lead to Rain: Explaining why Watershed Development in India Does Not Alleviate the Experience of Water Scarcity Watershed development (WSD) projects in India are key to meeting a range of human development goals in rain-fed agrarian landscapes. However, outcomes are often observed to be partial and short-lived. We offer a novel perspective on the reasons. Our analysis shows that the dominant water narratives' of WSD policy and practice and the lived experience of local people contribute to a naturalisation of water scarcity, resulting in widespread views that WSD is primarily a means for increasing irrigation water supply. We show how this over-simplifies the complex problem of agricultural water use and perversely contributes to a continuing experience of water scarcity rather than its resolution.",
2936,"CALCULATED WATER DEMAND AS THE MAIN FACTOR INFLUENCING THE RELIABILITY OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL FORECASTS AT THE EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER ELASTIC RESERVES The article covers the problems of low reliability of hydrogeological forecasts concerning the state of groundwater resources due to significant difference between the amount of estimated elastic reserves registered on governmental level with included in prognostic calculations and actual water intake dynamics of its temporal variations. As a result, it leads to overestimation of prognostic levels with actual state. This problem is most acute within the Almaty urban agglomeration. The choice of this region as a pioneer is obvious for hydrogeologists. Within the limits of the allocated territory as of 2008, the state balance accounts for about 15% of the total value of the drinking water quality of groundwater resources in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The volume of groundwater production within the region is about 45%. This burden on the subsoil is not presented in any other region of the Republic of Kazakhstan. On the basis of available developments in this issue, given appropriate solutions and ways of changing existing approaches to hydrogeological forecasts in estimating groundwater reserves are proposed to eliminate emerging inconsistencies, i.e. the implementation of forecasting taking into account the real, rather than overestimated in the calculation of the dynamics of water withdrawal.",
2937,"A follow-up study of mortality among the arseniasis patients exposed to indoor combustion of high arsenic coal in Southwest Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture, China Objective This study was directed to ascertain the mortality of a group of arseniasis patients in an endemic rural township in Southwest China, where the residents were exposed for decades to indoor combustion of high arsenic coal. Methods All the diagnosed arseniasis cases registered in 1991 were defined as the target population, which were assigned to three symptom subgroups by the severity of dermal lesions. The death cases were surveyed and checked. The follow-up period was 12.5 years. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of all death causes combined, all cancers combined, and the cancers at every site were analyzed. The age standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were calculated in three subgroups using the procedure of standardization. Results One hundred and six death cases were recorded. Liver cirrhosis, non-melanotic skin cancer, lung and liver cancer were the four most prevalent death causes and referred to 70.8% (75/106) of the total death cases. The mortality of all death causes combined was not higher than that of the whole of China in 2001 (SMR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93). The crude mortality rate of non-melanotic skin cancer in males reached up to 128.66/10(5). SMRs of lung cancer and larynx cancer in males (SMRs 2.84 and 27.27, 95% CIs 1.51-4.86 and 5.61-79.62, respectively) significantly exceeded the levels for all male Chinese. ASMRs of all death causes combined, all cancers combined and non-melanotic skin cancer in males of the severe dermal symptoms subgroup were significantly higher than those in medium and/or mild dermal symptom subgroups. Conclusion A significantly increased mortality due to lung cancer and non-melanotic skin cancer was confirmed, alike the situation in other arseniasis endemic areas in the world. No significant elevation of mortality due to liver cancer and bladder cancer was observed. Male arseniasis patients diagnosed with severe skin lesions face higher risks of malignancies and of non-melanotic skin cancer in particular in the following years.",
2938,"Arsenic toxicity to rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Bangladesh Natural contamination of groundwater with arsenic (As) occurs around the world but is most widespread in the river basin deltas of South and Southeast Asia. Shallow groundwater is extensively used in the Bengal basin for irrigation of rice in the dry winter season, leading to the possibility of As accumulation in soils, toxicity to rice and increased levels of As in rice grain and straw. The impact of As contaminated irrigation water on soil-As content and rice productivity was studied over two winter-season rice crops in the command area of a single tubewell in Faridpur district, Bangladesh. After 16-17 years of use of the tubewell, a spatially variable build up of As and other chemical constituents of the water (Fe, Mn and P) was observed over the command area, with soil-As levels ranging from about 10 to 70 mg kg(-1). A simple mass balance calculation using the current water As level of 0.13 mg As L-1 suggested that 96% of the added arsenic was retained in the soil. When BRRI dhan 29 rice was grown in two successive years across this soil-As gradient, yield declined progressively from 7-9 to 2-3 t ha(-1) with increasing soil-As concentration. The average yield loss over the 8 ha command area was estimated to be 16%. Rice-straw As content increased with increasing soil-As concentration; however, the toxicity of As to rice resulted in reduced grain-As concentrations in one of the 2 years. The likelihood of As-induced yield reductions and As accumulation in straw and grain has implications to agricultural sustainability, food quality and food security in As-affected regions throughout South and Southeast Asia.",
2939,"Intrusion-related gold deposits of North China craton, People's Republic of China Intrusion-related gold deposits are widely distributed within the North China craton or along its marginal fold belts. Presently, about 200 individual intrusion-related gold deposits (prospects) have been discovered, among which Yuerya, Anjiayingzi, Linglong, Jiaojia, Chenjiazhangzi, Qiyugou, Jinjiazhuang, Dongping, Hougou, Huangtuliang, Guilaizhuang, Wulashan and Donghuofang are the most important ones. In general, the intrusion-related gold deposits can be classified into three major groups according to their host rocks: (1) hosted by or related to felsic intrusions, including (1a) calc-alkaline granitoid intrusions and (1b) cryptoexplosion breccia pipes; (2) related to ultramafic intrusions, and (3) hosted by or related to alkaline intrusions. The first group contains the Yuerya, Anjiayingzi, Linglong, Jiaojia, Chenjiazhangzi and Qiyugou gold deposits. Gold mineralization at these deposits occurs within Mesozoic Yanshanian calc-alkaline granitoid intrusions or cryptoexplosion breccia pipes as gold-bearing quartz veins and replacement bodies. Pyrite, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, native gold and electrum are major metallic minerals. The Jinjiazhuang deposit belongs to the second group, and occurs within Hercynian diopsidite and peridotite as quartz veins and replacement bodies. Pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, native gold and electrum are identified. The third group includes the Dongping, Hougou, Huangtuliang, Guilaizhuang, Wulashan and Donghuofang deposits. Gold mineralization at these deposits occurs predominantly within the Hercynian alkaline intrusive complexes as K-feldspar-quartz veins and replacement bodies. Major metal minerals are pyrite, galena, chalcopyrite, tellurides, native gold and electrum. All these pyrite separates from Hercynian and Yanshanian intrusions or cryptoexplosion pipes associated with the gold deposits show a broad range in delta(34)S value, which is overall higher than those Precambrian rocks and their hosted gold deposits. For the alkaline intrusion-related gold deposits, the delta(34)S values of the sulfides (pyrite, galena and chalcopyrite) from the deposits increase systematically from orebodies to the alkaline intrusions. All of these intrusion-related gold deposits show relatively radiogenic lead isotopic compositions compared to mantle or lower crust curves. Most lead isotope data of sulfides from the gold ores plot in between the fields of the intrusions and Precambrian metamorphic rocks. Data are interpreted as indicative of a mixing of sulfur and lead from magma with those from Precambrian metamorphic rocks. Isotopic age data, geological and geochemical evidences suggest that the ore-forming materials for the intrusion-related gold deposits were generated during the emplacement of the Hercynian or Yanshanian intrusion. The calc-alkaline or alkaline magma may provide heat, volatiles and metals for the intrusion-related gold deposits. Evolved meteoric water, which circulated the wall rocks, was also progressively involved in the magmatic hydrothermal system, and may have dominated the ore fluids during late stage of ore-forming processes. Therefore, the ore fluid may have resulted from the mixing of calc-alkaline or alkaline magmatic fluids and evolved meteoric water. All these intrusion-related gold deposits are believed to be products of Hercynian or Yanshanian calc-alkaline and alkaline igneous processes along deep-seated fault zones within the North China craton or along its marginal belts.",
2940,"Health risk evaluation of uranium in groundwater of Bemetara district of Chhattisgarh state, India This study has been carried out to determine the uranium concentration associated with physicochemical parameters and water quality index during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon of Bemetara district to correlate the quality of water for public health. The correlation matrix has been applied for the determination of the correlation value to find out the relationship of uranium with water quality parameters. The uranium levels in water samples range from 1.15 to 83.5 mu g/L and 0.68 to 96.08 mu g/L during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, respectively. The uranium concentration of few samples exceeds the safe limit of 30 mu g/L prescribed by World Health Organization 2011. A positive correlation of uranium concentration with total hardness and total dissolved solids during both monsoons has been observed. The lifetime cancer risk varied from 0.07 x 10(-6) to 5.06 x 10(-6) and 0.04 x 10(-6) to 5.82 x 10(-6) in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period, respectively, which is lower than the maximum permissible limit (< 10(-3)). The corresponding values of hazard quotient of 21 samples in pre-monsoon and 16 samples in post-monsoon were found to be greater than unity, which indicates a significant risk due to chemical toxicity. The observed results clearly showed that there is no harmful effect by radiological risk, but chemical risk can affect human health.",
2941,"An Evaluation of WRF Microphysics Schemes for Simulating the Warm-Type Heavy Rain over the Korean Peninsula The Korean peninsula is the region of distinctly showing the heavy rain associated with relatively low storm height and small ice water content in the upper part of cloud system (i.e., so-called warm-type heavy rainfall). The satellite observations for the warm-type rain over Korea led to a conjecture that the cloud microphysics parameterization suitable for the continental deep convection may not work well for the warm-type heavy rainfall over the Korean peninsula. Therefore, there is a growing need to examine the performance of cloud microphysics schemes for simulating the warm-type heavy rain structures over the Korean peninsula. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of eight microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model how warm-type heavy rain structures can be simulated, in reference to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) reflectivity measurements. The results indicate that the WRF Double Moment 6-class (WDM6) scheme simulated best the vertical structure of warm-type heavy rain by virtue of a reasonable collision-coalescence process between liquid droplets and the smallest amount of snow. Nonetheless the WDM6 scheme appears to have limitations that need to be improved upon for a realistic reflectivity structure, in terms of the reflectivity slope below the melting layer, discontinuity in reflectivity profiles around the melting layer, and overestimation of upper-level reflectivity due to high graupel content.",
2942,"Considerations on Water Supply Pumping Station Operation in the Context of Sustainable Development Water and energy are among the most valuable resources worldwide, therefore specialists have to focus on technical means that enable better use thereof, also with respect to safety and efficiency. The study presents the operation efficiency improvement of a newly modernised water supply pumping station in Galesu irrigation system in the Dobrogea region, Romania. The technical measures led to a decrease of electrical power requirements by about 30%. A thorough study on the hydraulic shock pointed out the best protection solution provided with low-cost devices. A numerical simulation, conducted by the use of a non-commercial software, allowed to conduct a comparative study of the pressure field in different protection scenarios. The simulation showed no dangerous high-pressure values, but it revealed the occurrence of cavitation during hydraulic shock when the ducts have no protection devices. Simple protection solutions were compared, such as a two-stage closure of the check valve on the discharge duct and one or two air valves mounted in the most vulnerable cross sections of the discharge duct. The best protection was provided by a combination of these simple means.",
2943,"Arsenic and heavy metals health risk assessment through drinking water consumption in the Peshawar District, Pakistan This study aimed to assess the drinking water quality and human potential health risk in Peshawar, which is the most populous district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan. Water was randomly collected throughout Peshawar District (urban = 45 samples and rural = 29 samples). These samples were analyzed for heavy metal (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) concentrations using the atomic absorption spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, AAS-PEA-700). Heavy metal concentrations in drinking water revealed the highest pollution index (PI) values17.80, 11.92, 7.50, and 5.70 for the Pb, Cr, Cd, and Ni, respectively. The contaminations of Cd and Pb were significantly higher (p < .05) than their maximum allowable limits set by the World Health Organization. Heavy metal contaminations in drinking water were evaluated for health risk assessment: the chronic risk or hazard quotient (HQ) and cancer risk. Results revealed that HQ values were >1 for the Cd and Pb, suggesting that the exposed human beings could be at chronic risk. Therefore, serious measures such as drinking water treatments and contamination controlling policies are needed to avoid the hazardous effects of toxic heavy metals.",
2944,"Microbial diversity and function in crystalline basement beneath the Deccan Traps explored in a 3 km borehole at Koyna, western India Deep terrestrial subsurface represents a huge repository of global prokaryotic biomass. Given its vastness and importance, microbial life within the deep subsurface continental crust remains under-represented in global studies. We characterize the microbial communities of deep, extreme and oligotrophic realm hosted by crystalline Archaean granitic rocks underneath the Deccan Traps, through sampling via 3000â€‰m deep scientific borehole at Koyna, India through metagenomics, amplicon sequencing and cultivation-based analyses. Gene sequences 16S rRNA (7.37Â Ã—â€‰10(6) ) show considerable bacterial diversity and the existence of a core microbiome (5724 operational taxonomic units conserved out of a total 118,064 OTUs) across the depths. Relative abundance of different taxa of core microbiome varies with depth in response to prevailing lithology and geochemistry. Co-occurrence network analysis and cultivation attempt to elucidate close interactions among autotrophic and organotrophic bacteria. Shotgun metagenomics reveals a major role of autotrophic carbon fixation via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and genes responsible for energy and carbon metabolism. Deeper analysis suggests the existence of an 'acetate switch', coordinating biosynthesis and cellular homeostasis. We conclude that the microbial life in the nutrient- and energy-limited deep granitic crust is constrained by the depth and managed by a few core members via a close interplay between autotrophy and organotrophy.",
2945,"Delineation of Groundwater Potential Zones in Kakund Watershed, Eastern Rajasthan, Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques The remotely sensed data provides synoptic viewing and repetitive coverage for thematic mapping of natural resources. In the present study hydrogeomorphological mapping has been carried out in Kakund watershed, Eastern Rajasthan for delineating groundwater potential zones. IRS-ID LISS III Geocoded FCC data in conjunction with survey of India toposheet (1:50000 scale) and field inputs were used for thematic mapping. Geomorphic units identified through visual interpretation of FCC include: alluvial plain, plateau, valley fills, intermontane valleys, burried pediment, residual hills, and linear ridges. In addition, lineaments were mapped since they act as conduit for groundwater recharge. Majority of the lineaments trends NE-SW and a few along NW-SE directions and are confined to the southern and southeastern parts of the watershed. Based on hydrogeomorphological, geological and lineament mapping the Kakund watershed has qualitatively been categorized into four groundwater potential zones, viz. good to very good, moderate to good, poor to moderate and very poor to poor. The study reveals that only 10.97% of the area has good to very good, 35.41% area with moderate to good, 49.04% of the area has poor to moderate, while remaining 4.57% has poor to very poor groundwater potential.",
2946,"Multiple exposure pathways and health risk assessment of selenium for children in a coal mining area Selenium (Se) presents a dual role to human body, harmful or beneficial, depending on its concentration. The exposure to this element has been associated to coal mining. Health risk assessment allows estimating and evaluating the risks that environmental hazards pose to vulnerable groups of populations. The present study aimed to analyze the risk of exposure to Se through multiple exposure pathways in children living in Candiota city, where the largest coal reserve of Brazil is located. Data from previous environmental (air, soil, drinking water, and food) and population parameters (age, weight, and food intake) were used to assess the health risk, which was calculated with real values (extracted from the population) and fixed reference values, based on the USEPA recommendation. Most of the children had low health risk (HQ < 1); however, in the most conservative scenarios (higher Se values in the different matrices), there was a high health risk in both scenarios, using population data or the USEPA parameters. The mean HQ using reference values was twice higher than using real values. Se content in air, soil, and drinking water did not represent important average daily dose in both scenarios. While, food intake was a main source of Se exposure, contributing with 96.9% of total Se intake. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of food intake for exposure to Se and the difference between HQs using population measures and fixed parameters of the USEPA highlights the need for adaptations to local scenarios for a better dimensioning of toxicological risk management actions.",
2947,"Complementary-Relationship-Based Modeling of Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Across China During 1982-2012: Validations and Spatiotemporal Analyses Having recognized the limitations in spatial representativeness and/or temporal coverage of (i) current ground ETa observations and (ii) land surface model-and remote sensing-based ETa estimates due to uncertainties in soil and vegetation parameters, a calibration-free nonlinear complementary relationship (CR) model is employed with inputs of air and dew-point temperature, wind speed, and net radiation to estimate 0.1 degrees, monthly ETa over China during 1982-2012. The modeled ETa rates were first validated against 13 eddy-covariance measurements, producing Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values in the range of 0.72-0.94. On the basin scale, the modeled ETa values yielded a relative bias of 6%, and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value of 0.80 in comparison with water-balance-derived evapotranspiration rates across 10 major river basins in China, indicating the CR-simulated ETa rates reliable over China. Further evaluations suggest that the CR-based ETa product is more accurate than seven other mainstream ETa products. The 31-year mean annual ETa value decreases from the southeast to the northwest in China, resulting in a country average of 406 +/- 15 mm/year. The country-representative annual ETa rates slightly decreased with a rate of -0.5 mm/year (p = 0.86) during 1982-2012. Annual ETa increased significantly over most parts of western and northeastern China but decreased significantly in many regions of the North China Plain as well as in the eastern and southern coastal regions. The present CR-based method, with its calibration-free nature and minimal data requirement, could help future calibrations/verifications of the more complex and more data-intensive land surface model-and remote sensing-based models.",
2948,"Spatiotemporal Analysis of Soil Moisture and Optimal Sampling Design for Regional-Scale Soil Moisture Estimation in a Tropical Watershed of India Regional-scale soil moisture estimates are essential for several hydrological applications and for validating remote sensing-based soil moisture products. Characterization of the regional-scale soil moisture variability requires a robust in situ monitoring strategy at point scale to balance between representativeness and minimization of monitoring cost. In this study an optimal sampling design was determined to capture the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture at watershed scale. The study was conducted for the typical Indian conditions of extreme seasonal variability that leads to very wet (during monsoon) to dry (during hot summer) in the eastern India. Soil moisture monitoring was done at 83 locations in an agricultural watershed of 500 km(2) for 56 days of field campaigns across a year. Based on the analyses of 41,832 measurements collected during field campaigns, it was found that maximum numbers of required locations necessary to estimate watershed-mean soil moisture within +/- 2% accuracy are 30. Moreover, five randomly selected locations were found to be sufficient for capturing the temporal variability of watershed-mean soil moisture with an accuracy of +/- 3%. In addition, five most representative locations identified through time stability analysis can provide robust estimate of watershed-mean soil moisture with accuracy of +/- 2%. Further, soil properties and topography are identified as significant physical parameters that jointly control the spatiotemporal persistence and variability of soil moisture in the Indian watershed. These findings will be quite useful to provide guidelines for optimizing short-term soil moisture campaigns by sampling at few selected points representative of the watershed-mean behavior. Plain Language Summary Soil moisture observations and their spatiotemporal analysis are critical for many hydrologic applications. However, few studies have ever been conducted in tropical watersheds of India. Rice cultivation and monsoon precipitation of the region creates a different hydroclimatic scenario for soil moisture dynamics as compared to other regions of the world. Using 56 ground-based soil moisture monitoring campaigns at 83 locations in an agricultural watershed of 500 km2 across a year, this study provides insight to the soil moisture spatiotemporal variability and temporal stability features. Based on 41,832 measurements collected during field campaigns, it was found that maximum numbers of required locations necessary to estimate watershed-mean soil moisture within +/- 2% accuracy are 30. Moreover, five randomly selected locations were found to be sufficient for capturing the temporal variability of watershed-mean soil moisture with an accuracy of +/- 3%. In fact, five most representative locations identified through time stability analysis can provide robust estimate of watershed-mean soil moisture with accuracy of +/- 2%. These findings will be quite useful to provide guidelines for optimizing short-term soil moisture campaigns by sampling at few selected points representative of the watershed-mean behavior.",
2949,"Methodology for evaluating city-level energy footprint for water distribution systems Water distribution is a major contributor to energy use for water supply. Reducing network pressure can decrease energy use for centralised distribution while simultaneously increasing energy use for high-rise pumping. This study describes a method of calculating and optimising energy for water distribution at city level that incorporates both centralised and high-rise distribution and the pressure trade-off between them. The methodology is applied to 82 case cities in China and is used to judge whether China's recommended minimum pressure regulation leads to unnecessarily high energy use in certain cities. Results show that 63 of these cities could save energy by reducing the minimum and average pressure used to distribute water, with energy savings of up to 28% of total energy for water distribution. The methodology was also used to investigate how the distribution of households in buildings of different heights affects energy use for water distribution. Adjustments to pressure had greater impact on energy use and adjustments to building height distribution had less impact on energy use in cities with fewer high-rises. The methodology provides a way for urban planners, government and water companies to reduce energy use for urban water distribution. For the case of China, the results suggest a city-specific minimum pressure recommendation is more suitable than the existing nationwide recommendation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2950,"A geodynamic model for the Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2.27-1.96 Ga) Birimian Orogen of the southern West African Craton - Insights into an evolving accretionary-collisional orogenic system This study presents an updated geodynamic model for the 2270-1960 Ma Birimian Orogen in the southern West African Craton (sWAC), which form part of a large accretionary-collisional orogenic system that extends into the Reguibat shields in northern WAC and southwards into equivalent crust in the Amazon Craton. The early evolution of the orogen was characterized by deposition of volcanic-volcanosedimentary successions and emplacement of limited intrusives, with a significant contribution from juvenile sources. This was followed by a collisional phase, associated with the deposition of large volcano-sedimentary and siliciclastic successions in both deep and shallow water conditions, along with ongoing volcanic activity and widespread emplacement of compositionally diverse intrusives. This occurred contemporaneously with deformation, regional greenschistamphibolite facies metamorphism and juxtaposition of high and low-grade crustal domains, during what is referred to as the Eburnean Orogeny. A key aspect of the collisional phase is its diachronous nature, with the main period of magmatism, sedimentation and tectonothermal activity occurring around ca. 2160-2100 Ma in eastern sWAC, and between ca. 2120-2070 Ma in the west. The model envisions that the crust related to the accretionary phase formed in an elongate archipelago-style volcanic arc system, where juvenile crustal domains were juxtaposed with older continental fragments. The diachronous collisional phase is explained by largely continuous NW-directed (present-day orientation) indentation that affected the Birimian orogenic system during convergence, and which is inferred to reflect regional plate motions. The onset of the collisional phase in eastern sWAC is constrained to ca. 2200 Ma, which is marked by a gradual increase in the abundance of intrusives. However, its peak was not reached until 2160-2130 Ma, at which point the Birimian crust was affected by high-grade metamorphism. Continued NW-directed indentation during regional convergence drove the progressive westward shift in orogenic activity. A significant aspect of the model is the interplay between compression and extension, within the context of the overall NW-directed indentation that affected the system. Compression in response to convergence led deformation of the Birimian crust, but also triggered multiple periods of regional transtension, which led to the establishment of major structures, juxtaposition of high and low grade terranes, creation of basins in which supracrustal sequences were deposited, and establishment of magmatic and hydrothermal systems. These were subsequently overprinted and reactivated by deformation related to continued compression and convergence. The alternation between compression and extension within the context of regional convergence was a key factor in driving the evolution of the Birimian Orogen, and establishing the architecture of the crust exposed in sWAC. The end of orogenic activity in sWAC was marked by a progressive and diachronous decrease in magmatism, sedimentation and tectonothermal activity between 2100 and 2050 Ma and Ar-Ar cooling ages on amphibole and mica between ca. 2050-1960 Ma, which coincided with the migration of orogenic activity outboard to the crust preserved in sWAC, including domains in the Reguibat Shield and the Amazon Craton. It is argued that the evolution of the Birimian Orogen in sWAC occurred in a paleogeographic setting comparable to that of the modern day Philippine archipelago in SE Asia, where the current N-NNE directed motion of the Indo-Australian plates would be comparable to the proposed NW-directed convergence proposed here for the Birimian orogenic system. Such a setting provides an environment for the formation of large volumes of arc-related volcanic and volcanosedimentary successions in a range of depositional environments, as well as the potential for significant input of juvenile material. On a regional to global scale, plate tectonics may thus have operated in a manner comparable to today. However, the apparent absence of blueschists, boninites and complete ophiolitic sections in the Birimian Orogen, together with the presence of rare komatiites, indicate the effect of secular changes on a local scale.",
2951,"Adsorption of Congo red from aqueous solution using ZnO-modified SiO2 nanospheres with rough surfaces As one of the toxic dyes, Congo Red (CR) is considered as emerging pollutant in surface water, thus, the development of novel adsorbent for its efficient removal is necessary. Here, ZnO/SiO2 nanosphere composites with rough surfaces were synthesized by a facile wet impregnation method. The structure and morphology of as-prepared composites were characterized and their performances toward CR adsorption were evaluated. The ZnO/SiO2-1 composite exhibited high adsorption capacity of similar to 83 mg/g and fast adsorption kinetic for removal of CR from aqueous solution. The adsorption kinetic and isotherm data could be well interpreted by the Pseudo-second order rate equation and Langmuir adsorption isotherm, respectively. Moreover, the ZnO/SiO2-1 could be easily regenerated by calcination and the adsorption capacity could be maintained at high level (up to 83%) for at least 4 adsorption-regeneration cycles.

2952,"Distribution of detritivores in tropical forest streams of peninsular Malaysia: role of temperature, canopy cover and altitude variability The diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrate shredders were investigated in 52 forested streams (local scale) from nine catchments (regional scale) covering a large area of peninsular Malaysia. A total of 10,642 individuals of aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected, of which 18.22 % were shredders. Biodiversity of shredders was described by alpha (alpha(average) ), beta (beta) and gamma diversity (gamma) measures. We found high diversity and abundance of shredders in all catchments, represented by 1,939 individuals (range 6-115 and average per site of 37.29 +/- 3.48 SE) from 31 taxa with 2-13 taxa per site (alpha(average) = 6.98 +/- 0.33 SE) and 10-15 taxa per catchment (gamma = 13.33 +/- 0.55 SE). At the local scale, water temperature, stream width, depth and altitude were correlated significantly with diversity (Adj-R (2) = 0.205). Meanwhile, dissolved oxygen, stream velocity, water temperature, stream width and altitude were correlated to shredder abundance (Adj-R (2) = 0.242). At regional scale, however, water temperature was correlated negatively with beta and gamma diversity (r (2) = 0.161 and 0.237, respectively) as well as abundance of shredders (r (2) = 0.235). Canopy cover was correlated positively with beta diversity (r (2) = 0.378) and abundance (r (2) = 0.266), meanwhile altitude was correlated positively with beta (quadratic: r (2) = 0.175), gamma diversity (quadratic: r (2) = 0.848) as well as abundance (quadratic: r (2) = 0.299). The present study is considered as the first report describing the biodiversity and abundance of shredders in forested headwater streams across a large spatial scale in peninsular Malaysia. We concluded that water temperature has a negative effect while altitude showed a positive relationship with diversity and abundance of shredders. However, it was difficult to detect an influence of canopy cover on shredder diversity.",
2953,"Decratonic gold mineralization: Evidence from the Shangzhuang gold deposit, eastern North China Craton The Jiaodong Peninsula in the eastern North China Craton (NCC) hosts some of the world-class gold deposits. Among these, the Shangzhuang gold deposit represents a typical fault-zone hosted disseminated-and stockwork-style gold mineralization. The mineralization is characterized by intense hydrothermal alteration halos in the wallrocks with the mineralized veins intruding into altered wallrocks. Zircon U-Pb isotope dating constrains the timing of emplacement of the Guojialing granodiorite as 130 +/- 1 Ma. Five molybdenite samples from the main mineralization stage veins yielded a well-fitted isochron age of 126 +/- 2 Ma (MSWD = 1.3), marking the timing of gold mineralization. Four types of fluid inclusions are identified at Shangzhuang, and their petrographic and microthermometric features suggest fluid immiscibility followed by fluid mixing. This inference is also supported by oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data of quartz veins from stage III. The measured delta O-18 values of quartz are + 12.3 to + 13.7%0 for stage II and + 11.7 to + 12.0 parts per thousand for stage III, with calculated delta O-18(fluid) values for stage II ranging from + 5.9 to + 7.3 parts per thousand. and for stage III from + 3.4 to + 3.7 parts per thousand. delta D values for stage II and III quartz range from -65.3 to -75.2 parts per thousand and -70.6 to -74.7 parts per thousand, respectively. The data suggest that the ore-forming fluids were initially derived from magmatic sources, followed by mixing with meteoric water. SIMS in-situ sulfur isotope analyses of two types of pyrite (Py I and Py II) from different mineralization stages show different sulfur isotope features. The delta S-34 values for Py I (+ 10.2 to + 113 parts per thousand, mean = + 10.8 parts per thousand, n = 25) are higher than those of the later mostly gold-related Py II (+ 4.1 to + 6.8 parts per thousand, mean = + 5.4 parts per thousand, n = 27). The higher delta S-34 values of Py I are correlated to degassing of mantle wedge metasomatized by the slab fluids. The relatively lower delta S-34 values of Py II might suggest increasing of f(o2) through fluid mixing between ore-forming fluids and meteoric water. The temporal, spatial and tectonic relations between the giant gold mineralization and destruction of the NCC suggest a genetic linkage. The gold mineralization between 126 and 117 Ma at Jiaodong was probably initiated at the peak of decratonization (ca. 125 Ma) of the eastern NCC. Phanerozoic craton margin orogeny also played a critical role in the generation of the early Cretaceous giant gold deposits in the eastern NCC. Integrated geological characteristics, mineralization features, metallogenic age, sources of ore-forming fluids and sulfur, and tectonic settings favor a decratonic gold mineralization model for the Shangzhuang gold deposit. The geodynamic scenario proposed for the early Cretaceous giant gold mineralization event in the eastern NCC includes the paleo-West Pacific plate subduction, asthenospheric upwelling, multiple subduction-collision processes along the margins.

2954,"Geomorphology and urban geology of Bukavu (RD Congo): interaction between slope instability and human settlement The city of Bukavu, on the south coast of Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, suffers from frequent landsliding, which leads to continual damage and destruction of buildings, roads, waterworks and sewerage infrastructure. Thirty-one landslides identified on aerial photographs of 1954 and 1973 are located outside the Bukavu micro-rift and are related to actively incising rivers. Their origin is thought to be due to increases in hydrostatic pressure. Six landslides occur within the Bukavu micro-rift, four of which are much larger and wider than other slope failures in the study region. These large landslides are adjacent to, or crossed by, active faults. They fall far below the topographic threshold envelope, a relationship of slopes at the head of the slide and the surface area drained into it, indicating seismic or anthropomorphic triggering. The Bukavu landslides still reactivate occasionally. Deforestation, followed by a large increase in the population, have been indirect causes of the reactivated mass wasting processes. On the steep slopes in the south of the city the high density of newly built houses has led to reduced water infiltration and enhanced runoff, causing landslides and mudflows. Very high spatial resolution IKONOS satellite images have recently been used as base maps for geohazard assessments of Bukavu. A geographical information system (GIS) has been developed for Bukavu's planners: this shows the locations of buildings, roads and tracks, the river network, the water distribution system and the sewerage infrastructure, as well as areas of slope instability.",

In Pakistan almost 3/4th of the land is either already affected or likely to be affected by it. Desertification process has been active since historical times in areas now-a-days constituting Pakistan. Amongst the factors affecting desertification in Pakistan, the fundamental factor is population pressure. Other major immediate physical cause of ecological degradation includes: excessive felling of trees, inadequate reforestation activities, inappropriate cultivation practices in hilly and rain fed farming area, uncontrolled and excessive livestock grazing in forest and rangeland. Inadequate efforts with regard to watershed protection and management in the catchments areas of reservoirs lead to sever soil erosion. Irrational irrigation practices also enhance land degradation. As a result of such activities vegetation cover is destroyed, and it also leads to prevent regeneration of grasses and trees etc. The Desertification occur in both rain fed as well as irrigated lands. Pakistan is mainly a dryland country, where 80 % of its land is arid and semi-arid. Two-third of its human population depends on these drylands to support their livelihood. Like many other developing countries, Pakistan is severely affected by land degradation and desertification. Unsustainable land management practices are causing enormous environmental problems, including soil erosion, loss of soil fertility, flash floods, sedimentation of canals and water courses, deforestation and associated loss of carbon sequestration capacity and biodiversity. In recent years, number of Federal and provincial agencies are engaged to combat desertification. However, the efforts made by the originations and departments along with non-government organizations hardly fill the gap between its increasing intensity and disaster risk reduction measures to control desertification.",
2956,"Changes of the land cover, according to the types of landscape described in the social metabolism. Case study: West of the Guamues Lake (lagoon of La Cocha) Colombia. 1989-2016 the object of this article is to analyze the changes that land cover in the west of La Cocha lagoon has had since the year 1989 until 2016, through the use of the Corine Land Cover methodology. In turn, linking with the scenarios presented by Victor Toledo on social metabolism, in which the following environments are present: Environment Used (MAU, by its acronym in Spanish), Transformed Environment (MAT, by its acronym in Spanish), and Conserved Environment (MAC, by its acronym in Spanish). In the lagoon of La Cocha there are different types of ecosystems: the paramo, the high Andean jungle and the wetland. These ecosystems offer the community water supply services, water regulation, as well as cultural services. Reasons that have led to these being altered, being the change of the land's coverage one of these alterations. The results identified nineteen types of coverage for the year of 1989 and twenty-one types of coverage for the year 2016, in the same way eleven exchange rates were identified. These exchange rates are directly related to proximal and adjacent causes or, in other words, to factors that affect the occurrence of those changes in coverage. Thus, in these 27 years analyzed, there is a decrease in the environmentally conserved MAC and the environment used MAU. Therefore, the transformed MAT environment has had an increase, mainly due to factors linked to violence, poor policies, lack of projects and lack of technical advice for farmers.",
2957,"Temporal variation of vegetation at two operating landfills and its implications for landfill phytoremediation Landfilling is a popular method to dispose of solid waste around the world, but this practice is associated with inevitable negative consequences such as air and water pollution and potential health hazards. Phytoremediation is an economical and promising technology to address these problems. To select suitable species for restoring landfills in China, the vegetation characteristics and their physiological activities were investigated in two different landfills. The results showed that the vegetation coverage of the two landfills both increased with the closure time. The species diversity decreased with the closure time in the Chongming landfill, whereas it showed the opposite trend in the Jiangcungou landfill. Five dominant species (Conyza canadensis, Setaria viridis, Sesbania cannabina, Suaeda glauca, and Phragmites australis) and four dominant species (Festuca elata Keng, Amaranthus retroflexus, Lolium multiflorum, and Kochia scoparia) were identified in the Chongming landfill and Jiangcungou landfill, respectively, and these dominant species were mainly annual plants. In addition, the net photosynthetic rate of P. australis and K. scoparia was the highest in the Chongming landfill and Jiangcungou landfill, respectively. Their photosynthetic rates were influenced significantly by stomatal conductance. Based on the overall results, among the dominant species identified, P. australis and K. scoparia represent potentially well suited plants to use in the remediation of landfills in China, because of their strong adaptability to landfill environments and natural occurrence in landfills.",
2958,"An integrated geospatial correlation analysis and human health risk assessment approach for investigating abandoned industrial sites An integrated geospatial correlation analysis (GCA)-human health risk assessment (HHRA) approach was developed to investigate abandoned industrial sites featured by heterogeneous contamination data. Critical areas of high health risk concerns can be prioritized for remediation using the integrated approach. An abandoned chemical complex site in Hubei, China was investigated as a case study. GCA and HHRA were performed using soil and groundwater sampling data collected in 2016 and 2019. Benzene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, 2-nitrochlorobenzene, and Î±-hexachlorocyclohexane were determined to be critical contaminants in soil. The 2019 sampling data revealed new contaminated locations that were not found in the 2016 sampling campaign. High concentrations (89.81-386.55Â mg/L) of vinyl chloride were also found in groundwater samples. Several critical location clusters of high concentrations of dichlorobenzenes, chlorobenzene, and Î±-hexachlorocyclohexane were found within the site according to the GCA outcomes. These contaminants could pose significant cancer and non-cancer risks to onsite workers. The critical areas were ranked according to cancer and non-cancer risks estimated by HHRA, respectively, for informed remediation planning. Among the critical contaminants, Î±-hexachlorocyclohexane, 2-nitrochlorobenzene, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene in soil, as well as vinyl chloride in groundwater, contributed a predominant part to the total health risk. The integrated approach can be used to assess the contamination of other similar abandoned industrial complex sites.",
2959,"Modelling Debris Flow Runout: A Case Study on the Mesilau Watershed, Kundasang, Sabah Debris flows are among the fatal geological hazards in Malaysia, with 23 incidents recorded in the last two decades. To date, very few studies have been carried out to understand the debris flow processes, causes, and runouts nationwide. This study simulated the debris flow at the Mesilau watershed of Kundasang Sabah caused by the prolonged rainfall after the 2015 Ranau earthquake. Several interrelated processing platforms, such as ArcGIS, HEC-HMS, and HyperKANAKO, were used to extract the parameters, model the debris flow, and perform a sensitivity analysis to achieve the best-fit debris flow runout. The debris flow travelled at least 18.6 km to the Liwagu Dam. The best-fit runout suggested that the average velocity was 12.5 m/s and the lead time to arrive at the Mesilau village was 4.5 min. This high debris flow velocity was probably due to the high-water content from the watershed baseflow with a discharge rate of 563.8 m(3)/s. The flow depth and depositional thickness were both lower than 5.0 m. This study could provide crucial inputs for designing an early warning system, improving risk communication, and strengthening the local disaster risk reduction and resilience strategy in a tectonically active area in Malaysia.</p>",
2960,"Long-term impacts of gold and uranium mining on water quality in dolomitic regions - Examples from the Wonderfonteinspruit catchment in South Africa A number of gold and uranium mines in South Africa are located in areas where compartmentalised dolomitic rock forms extensive karst aquifers overlaying mined reefs. Apart from dewatering of such aquifers triggering widespread sinkhole formation and impacting on water availability by drying up of springs and boreholes, mining activities also impact on the quality of local water resources. Of particular concern to downstream users is uranium pollution of ground- and surface water often associated with gold in the mined reefs. This paper estimates potential U-fluxes associated with different types of mining-sources assessing their varying significance in past, present and future.",
2961,"Recharge flux to the Nubian Sandstone aquifer and its impact on the present development in southwest Egypt The southwestern part of Egypt (East El Oweinat) is an arid area with no surface water and only one resource of useable groundwater in the well-known Nubian Sandstone aquifer. This resource has been heavily exploited since 1990, which has led to a continuous decline in the potentiometric surface of this aquifer. The groundwater recharge in the concerned area depends exclusively on the subsurface inflow across the Egyptian/Sudanese borders. A FEFLOW, finite element groundwater model, has been used to investigate the length of the recharge window and to predict the hydrodynamic impacts of different groundwater extractions on the potentiometry of this aquifer. A complete database of the hydrogeological and drilling information of about 600 water wells drilled in the period 1985-2010 was evaluated and used for the model parameter input as well as for its simulation. The results of steady-state simulation indicate that the length of the southwest flux boundary is about 170 km with angle flow direction about 52 NW with a groundwater flow rate about 0.018 m/day. A calibrated regional numerical model with refined grid on the pumping centres, hydraulic properties and flux boundary in the southwest is used to simulate the impacts of the present and planned groundwater extraction on the potentiometry of the aquifer. The results show a real danger of increasing the water depth to uneconomic lifting depth. Through implementation of 135 pumping wells in time 2002-2008, the lowering of water table ranges from I to 1.5 m in the reclamation areas. On the other hand, the distribution of 1600 proposed wells with distance between every two adjacent wells not less than 2700 m indicates that the lowering of water table ranges from 5 m away of the reclamation areas to 15 m in the reclamation areas in time period of 27 years (2008-2035). This result seems to be the better for the present irrigation project in East El Oweinat area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
2962,"Integrated metagenomic and physiochemical analyses to evaluate the potential role of microbes in the sand filter of a drinking water treatment system While sand filters are widely used to treat drinking water, the role of sand filter associated microorganisms in water purification has not been extensively studied. In the current investigation, we integrated molecular (based on metagenomic) and physicochemical analyses to elucidate microbial community composition and function in a common sand filter used to treat groundwater for potable consumption. The results revealed that the biofilm developed rapidly within 2 days (reaching â‰ˆ 10(11) prokaryotes per gram) in the sand filter along with abiotic and biotic particulates accumulated in the interstitial spaces. Bacteria (up to 90%) dominated the biofilm microbial community, with Alphaproteobacteria being the most common class. Thaumarchaeota was the sole phylum of Archaea, which might be involved in ammonia oxidation. Function annotation of metagenomic datasets revealed a number of aromatic degradation pathway genes, such as aromatic oxygenase and dehydrogenase genes, in the biofilm, suggesting a significant role for microbes in the breakdown of aromatic compounds in groundwater. Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification pathways were confirmed as the primary routes of nitrogen removal. Dissolved heavy metals in groundwater, e.g. Mn(2+) and As(3+), might be biologically oxidized to insoluble or easily adsorbed compounds and deposited in the sand filter. Our study demonstrated that the role of the microbial community in the sand filter treatment system are critical to effective water purification in drinking water.",
2963,"Synthesizing a Regional Territorial Evapotranspiration Dataset for Northern China As a vital role in the processes of the energy balance and hydrological cycles, actual evapotranspiration (ET) is relevant to many agricultural, ecological and water resource management studies. The available global or regional ET products provide ET estimations with various temporal ranges, spatial resolutions and calculation methods (algorithms, inputs and parameterization, etc.), leading to varying degrees of introduced uncertainty. Northern China is the main agriculturally productive region supporting the whole country; thus, understanding the spatial and temporal changes in ET is essential to ensure water resource and food security. We developed a synthesis ET dataset for Northern China at a 1000 m spatial resolution, with a monthly temporal resolution covering a period ranging from 1982 to 2017, using an in-depth assessment of several ET products. Specifically, assessments were performed using in situ measured ET from eddy covariance (EC) observation towers at the site-pixel scale over interannual months under the conditions of different land cover types, climatic zones and elevation levels to select the most optimally performing ET products to be used in the synthesized ET dataset. Eight indicators under 21 conditions were involved in the assessment sheet, while the statistics of the different ET product occurrences and corresponding ratios were analyzed to select the best-performing ET products to build the synthesis ET dataset using the weighted mean method. The weights were determined by the Taylor skill score (TSS), calculated with ET products and EC ET observation data. Based on the assessment results, the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML_v2), ETWatch and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) datasets were selected for implementation in the synthesis ET dataset from 2003 to 2017, while Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) v3.3a, complementary relationship (CR) ET, and Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) datasets were chosen for the synthesis ET dataset from 1982 to 2002. The weighted mean synthesized results from 2003 to 2017 performed well when compared to the in situ measured EC ET values produced under all of the above conditions, while the synthesized results from 1982 to 2002 performed well through the water balance method in Heihe River Basin. These results can provide more stable ET estimations for Northern China, which can contribute to relevant agricultural, ecological and hydrological studies.",
2964,"Non-negligible impacts of clean air regulations on the reduction of tropospheric NO(2) over East China during the COVID-19 pandemic observed by OMI and TROPOMI We study the variation of tropospheric NO(2) vertical column densities (TropNO(2)VCDs) over East China during the 2005-2020 lunar new year (LNY) holiday seasons to understand factors on the reduction of tropospheric NO(2) during the outbreak of COVID-19 in East China using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations. TropNO(2)VCDs from OMI and TROPOMI reveal sharp reductions of 33%-72% during 2020 LNY holiday season and the co-occurring outbreak of COVID-19 relative to the climatological mean of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, and 22%-67% reduction relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season. These reductions of TropNO(2)VCD occur majorly over highly polluted metropolitan areas with condensed industrial and transportation emission sources. COVID-19 control measures including lockdowns and shelter-in-place regulations are the primary reason for these tropospheric NO(2) reductions over most areas of East China in 2020 LNY holiday season relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season, as COVID-19 control measures may explain ~87%-90% of tropospheric NO(2) reduction in Wuhan as well as ~62%-89% in Beijing, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Sichuan Basin areas. The clean air regulation of China also contributes significantly to reductions of tropospheric NO(2) simultaneously and is the primary factor in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) area, by explaining ~56%-63% of the tropospheric NO(2) reduction there.",
2965,"Diarrhea prevalence in a randomized, controlled prospective trial of point-of-use water filters in homes and schools in the Dominican Republic BACKGROUND: Lack of sustainable access to clean drinking water continues to be an issue of paramount global importance, leading to millions of preventable deaths annually. Best practices for providing sustainable access to clean drinking water, however, remain unclear. Widespread installation of low-cost, in-home, point of use water filtration systems is a promising strategy. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial whereby 16 villages were selected and randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms based on the installation location of SawyerÂ® PointONEâ„¢ filters (filter in both home and school; filter in home only; filter in school only; control group). Water samples and self-reported information on diarrhea were collected at multiple times throughout the study. RESULTS: Self-reported household prevalence of diarrhea decreased from 25.6 to 9.76% from installation to follow-up (at least 7 days, and up to 200 days post-filter installation). These declines were also observed in diarrhea with economic or educational consequences (diarrhea which led to medical treatment and/or missing school or work) with baseline prevalence of 9.64% declining to 1.57%. Decreases in diarrhea prevalence were observed across age groups. There was no evidence of a loss of efficacy of filters up to 200 days post-filter installation. Installation of filters in schools was not associated with decreases in diarrhea prevalence in school-aged children or family members. Unfiltered water samples both at schools and homes contained potential waterborne bacterial pathogens, dissolved heavy metals and metals associated with particulates. All dissolved metals were detected at levels below World Health Organization action guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This controlled trial provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of point-of-use, hollow fiber membrane filters at reducing diarrhea from bacterial sources up to 200 days post-installation when installed in homes. No statistically significant reduction in diarrhea was found when filters were installed in schools. Further research is needed in order to explore filter efficacy and utilization after 200 days post-installation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03972618 .

2966,"Vitamin C lowers mutagenic and toxic effect of hexavalent chromium in guinea pigs The mutagenic effect of intraperitoneally injected K2Cr2O7 was significantly higher in vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs than in animals fed diet with high vitamin C content. Mutagenic and toxic effects of hexavalent chromium were more expressed in vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs administered K2Cr2O7 in drinking water: the number of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes of bone marrow was increased, and the activity of O-demethylase and the levels of cytochromes P-450 and b5 in liver microsomes were decreased. In guinea pigs fed high vitamin C diet the same doses of bichromate in drinking water evoked no mutagenic changes in the bone marrow and no changes in microsomal enzymes in the liver. These results indicate that high intake of ascorbic acid in the diet reduces mutagenic effects of K2Cr2O7 and its toxic influence on drug metabolizing enzymes in hepatocytes. The protective effect ascorbic acid consists most probably in the enhanced extracellular and intracellular reduction of hexavalent chromium to the less toxic and less mutagenic trivalent chromium.",
2967,"Naturally occurring contamination in the Mancos Shale Some uranium mill tailings disposal cells were constructed on dark-gray shale of the Upper Cretaceous Mancos Shale. Shale of this formation contains contaminants similar to those in mill tailings. To establish the contributions derived from the Mancos, we sampled 51 locations in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. Many of the groundwater samples were saline with nitrate, selenium, and uranium concentrations commonly exceeding 250,â€‰000, 1000, and 200 Î¼g/L, respectively. Higher concentrations were limited to groundwater associated with shale beds, but were not correlated with geographic area, stratigraphic position, or source of water. The elevated concentrations suggest that naturally occurring contamination should be considered when evaluating groundwater cleanup levels. At several locations, seep water was yellow or red, caused in part by dissolved organic carbon concentrations up to 280 mg/L. Most seeps had (234)U to (238)U activity ratios greater than 2, indicating preferential leaching of (234)U. Seeps were slightly enriched in (18)O relative to the meteoric water line, indicating limited evaporation. Conceptually, major ion chemical reactions are dominated by calcite dissolution following proton release from pyrite oxidation and subsequent exchange by calcium for sodium residing on clay mineral exchange sites. Contaminants are likely released from organic matter and mineral surfaces during weathering.",
2968,"Assessment of aeolian desertification trends from 1975's to 2005's in the watershed of the Longyangxia Reservoir in the upper reaches of China's Yellow River Global climate change will affect the ecology and environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, thus increasing attention is being paid to the aeolian desertification that is occurring in the watershed that supplies the Longyangxia Reservoir in the upper reaches of China's Yellow River. We must assess the aeolian desertification trends before developing a plan to restore the region's degraded eco-environment. In this study, land suffered from aeolian desertification was classified into four levels (slight, moderate, severe, and extremely severe) using a series of indices. Interpretation of Landsat MSS and TM data from 1975's, 1989's, and 2005's was used to establish databases of aeolian desertified land at these three times. We then derived the aeolian desertification trends during the study period by overlaying the consecutive databases, and we analyzed the driving factors responsible for the observed aeolian desertification. The results show a total of 1,721,478.02 ha of aeolian desertified land in 2005's, accounting for 13% of the region's total area. From 1975's to 1989's, the area of aeolian desertified land increased by 229,307.26 ha, which represents a 15% increase compared to the 1975's area; and from 1989's to 2005's, the area of aeolian desertified land decreased by 19,079.87 ha, which represents a 1% decrease compared to the 1989's area. The main driving factors responsible for this increased aeolian desertification were climate factors (high wind velocity and an increase in annual temperature, combined with low precipitation and high evaporation) as well as unsustainable human activities and inappropriate policy measures. A series of key national projects initiated to combat degradation of the study area's eco-environment led to a decrease of aeolian desertified land through obvious restoration of vegetation.

2969,"Waters Metallic Typology of Oued Tisslit-Talssint (Morocco Oriental) In The purpose of the management and conservation of the aquatic environment of WadiTislit-Talssint, a principal components analysis of eight heavy metals, has been conduct during the period of low water (May 2011). The visualization of results has allowed us to show that, Mn, Fe and Ni are positively correlated to the axis F1, unlike the heavy metals: Co, Cu, Cd and Zn which is associated with this axis negatively. On the main axis F2, only the problem that a positive correlation, as well the application of the principal component analysis on these results, shows that we have two groups of stations: a first group of stations in the positive part of the F axis1, characterized by waters with high concentrations (Mn, Fe and Ni), in the stations S0 and sc1. A second group of stations in the negative part of the F axis1, characterized by waters with high concentrations (Cu, Cd, Zn, and CO in the stations (SR1 and SR2). This enrichment in metallic elements is to put in relationship with the inputs of wastewater and solid waste of the commune of Talssint, flowing upstream of the stations SR1 and directly at the level of the station SR2.",
2970,"Environmental impact by spill of geothermal fluids at the geothermal field of Los Azufres, Michoacan, Mexico Monitoring of surface water and shallow aquifers inside and outside of the Los Azufres geothermal field during the period November 1994 to May 1996 led to the detection of some contamination of surface water and shallow aquifers due to exploitation of the deep brines. Leaking of evaporation ponds and pipelines, occasionally overflowing of reinjection wells and pond rims as well as outflowing of brines during rehabilitation or drilling operations, are potential contamination sources within the cycle of geothermal production. Temporarily and/or permanently increased trace elements concentrations, especially Fe, Mn, F, B, and As in surface waters within the geothermal field as well as up to 10 km outside, were observed. Maximum values of 125 and 8 mg L-1 were observed for B and As, respectively. The discharge of hypersaline geothermal brines also causes salinization of surrounding soils. It occasionally happens that cattle drink from the brines. The use of the river for irrigation and drinking water supply in the surrounding regions may cause accumulation of toxic elements in the human food chain or may endanger the public health. The establishment of a closed geothermal production cycle can be achieved by simple remediation techniques, such as sealing of the pond walls, removal of overflow channels, direct reinjection without any reposal time in evaporation ponds, as well as an improved security and control system.",
2971,"Influence of medium components and metabolic inhibitors on citric acid production by Penicillium simplicissimum Penicillium simplicissimum excreted more than 100 mmol citric acid l-1 [2.9 mmol (g dry wt)-1; 9 d] if an industrial filter dust (> 50% ZnO) providing a high extracellular buffering capacity was present in the medium. A similar specific [2 mmol (g dry wt)-1], but lower absolute (26 mmol l-1), citric acid excretion occurred in the absence of an extracellular buffer and if amino acids or urea were used as nitrogen source. P. simplicissimum excreted no citric acid under conditions where Aspergillus niger produces citric acid (deficiency of trace elements, low pH and reduced biomass formation). Citric acid excretion by P. simplicissimum always paralleled biomass formation and occurred in a pH range between 4 and 7. This indicated that different imbalances of metabolism were responsible for citric acid excretion in A. niger and P. simplicissimum. However, provided a high extracellular buffering capacity was present, the response of the Penicillium system to different carbon and nitrogen sources was similar to the Aspergillus system. In contrast, the metals iron and copper had virtually no effect on citric acid excretion compared with A. niger. Estimation of intracellular citric acid, as well as the effects of the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol, and the H(+)-ATPase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate, led to the conclusion that the buffer-stimulated citric acid efflux was dependent on metabolic energy and an energized plasma membrane, respectively. Despite similarities to the Aspergillus system, a different mechanism for buffer-stimulated citric acid excretion by P. simplicissimum seems probable.",
2972,"Toxicity evaluation of reactive dyestuffs, auxiliaries and selected effluents in textile finishing industry to luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri The toxicity of 17 selected process effluents, 11 reactive dyestuffs and 8 auxiliaries from a textile dyeing and finishing mill in Ayazaga, Istanbul, Turkey was evaluated by bioluminescence test using bacteria Vibrio fischeri in LUMIStox 300. The EC20 and EC50 for auxiliaries, the EC20 for dyestuffs were determined. For selected process effluents GL-values, the dilution level at which a wastewater sample causes less than 20% inhibition, were examined. Our results demonstrate that the toxicity assessment with luminescent bacteria is effective and of practical use for chemicals applied in textile finishing industry with the limitation of the deep dark-colored dye bath samples and for the related effluents. Inhibition effects of numerous dyestuffs as well as auxiliaries to luminescent bacteria differed considerably with a range 5-600 mg l(-1) for EC20 and 9-6930 mg l(-1) for EC50, respectively. Among 17 effluents, I sample exhibited high toxicity (GL = 100), 7 showed moderate toxicity (GL = 12-32), and 9 had a GL-value <10 indicating a low or no toxicity.",
2973,"Economical solution to remove microbes from harvested roof water Scarcity of potable water is being experienced throughout the world due to increasing population (demand) and environmental pollution. These shortages are experienced more by poor rather than the rich, who can afford costly modern technologies for survival. Roof water harvesting is an ideal technique to collect and store water for drinking purposes. However, with time, in spite of all the precautions, there is a possibility of development of microbes in stored water that makes it unsafe for drinking. Moreover, microbe infected water is one of the major concern in most parts of developing countries. There are many water purification methods, although, most of them are expensive and beyond the reach of many people, especially in rural areas. In India, since ancient times, Ayurveda recommends use of copper pots / vessels for storing drinking- water, but, in last few decades, copper is replaced by steel, plastic and earthen pots. In conventional water distribution system chlorine is used to disinfect drinking water, but, it has several detrimental effects, so replacement of chlorine is essential. In this study an attempt was made to study the best method among the Copper, Silver treatment, earthen pot or Plastic jugs for removal of biological contamination from drinking water for domestic use. The result revealed that copper vessel showed maximum inhibitory effect on coliform as well as total bacterial count at 12 hrs and 24 hrs. There was a slight increase in pH and Copper concentration but it remains within the permissible limits laid by World Health Organization. The findings indicate that vessel or pot made up of copper could be used for antimicrobial treatment for purification of drinking water. It would be very economical solution to disinfect potable water, without any energy requirements, which could be adopted in urban / rural areas of the developing countries.

2974,"KNOWLEDGE FROM RECENT INVESTIGATION ON FLOW REGIME CHARACTERISTICS IN DEBRIS BED FORMATION BEHAVIOR RELATED TO SFR SEVERE ACCIDENT ANALYSES Studies on debris bed formation behavior are of crucial importance for the improved evaluation of core relocation and debris bed coolability that might be encountered in a Core Disruptive Accident (CDA) of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors (SFR). Motivated to clarify the characteristics of flow regimes underlying this behavior, both experimental investigations and empirical-model development are being performed at the Sun Yat-sen University. As for the experimental study, several series of simulated experiments are being conducted by discharging various solid particles into water pools. To obtain a comprehensive understanding, a variety of experimental parameters, including particle size (0.256-8mm), particle density (glass, alumina, zirconia, steel and lead), particle shape (spherical and irregularly-shaped), water depth (0,-60cm), particle release pipe diameter (10-30mm) as well as the particle release height (110-130cm) were varied. It is found that due to the different interaction mechanisms between solid particles and water pool, four kinds of flow regimes, termed respectively as the particle-suspension regime, the pool-convection dominant regime, the transitional regime and the particle inertial dominant regime, were identifiable. As for the empirical-model development, by using dimensional analysis technique, a regime map (base map), which is restricted to predictions of spherical particles up until now, was recently suggested. It is shown that a respectable agreement between experiments and the regime-map predictions could be obtained. This work, which gives a large palette of favorable data and insight for a better understanding and an improved estimation of CDAs in SFRs, is expected to benefit future analyses and verifications of SFR severe accident analysis codes in China.",
2975,"Geochemical and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in Ferdows area, northeast of Iran The chemical analysis of 19 water wells in Ferdows area, Northeastern Iran, has been evaluated to determine the hydrogeochemical processes and ion concentration background in the region. In the study area, the order of cation and anion abundance is Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and Cl- > SO (4) (-2) > HCO3 (-) > NO3 (-), respectively, and the dominating hydrochemical types are Na-Cl. Most metal concentrations in water depend on the mineral solubility, and pH, Eh, and salinity of the solution. Their I REE pound concentrations showed excellent correlations with parameters such as TDS and pH. North American Shale Composite (NASC)-normalized REE patterns are enriched in the HREEs relative to the LREEs for all groundwaters. They all have positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.752-3.934) and slightly negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* = 0.019-1.057). Reduction-oxidation, complexation, desorption, and re-adsorption alter groundwater REE concentrations and fractionation patterns. The positive Eu anomalies in groundwaters are probably due to preferential mobilization of Eu2+ relative to the trivalent REEs in the reducing condition.",
2976,"Food security and eco-terrorism impacts on environmental security through vulnerabilities Food security requires appropriate agricultural management and utilization of natural resources and eco-systems, as well as good governance and sustainable political systems. Food security is directly affected by climate change effects that lead to concerns in rural livelihoods. Bio-energy developments present both opportunities and challenges for socioeconomic development and the environment. In that sense, bio-energy solutions should strive to be environmentally sensitive and have a positive social impact. On the other side, trade policy enforced via World Trade Organisation (WTO) is expected to play a role in mitigating and adapting to global climate change by increasing incentives to use the most energy efficient environmental goods and services. The recent food and financial crises developed from different underlying causes but intertwined in complex ways through their implications for financial and economic stability, food security, and political security. As the majority of the poor in the world are considered to be depended on agriculture, the severeness of the climate change effects may lead to food system risks and more of the societal and political risks can be incurred in the future. The potential of food price volatility and climate change leading a rise in food insecurity among the poor groups is significant, and thus, can be expected to bring social disturbances and terrorism in the short to long term. Food security is a hot topic. Therefore, its disruption via environmental breakdown is an obvious cause for terrorism. Although the biotechnology revolution is very relevant to the problems of food security, poverty reduction, and environmental conservation in the developing world, it raises many questions relating to ethics, intellectual property rights, and bio-safety. Some policy alternatives for environment friendly support of food security consist in increasing productivity on the non-forest fertile soils and in animal production systems or to reduce postharvest losses, providing greater incentives for agriculture to use water more efficiently, promoting larger investments in agricultural research to raise production with environment friendly techniques. Global environmental change (GEC) will have serious consequences for food security, particularly for more vulnerable groups. Adapting to the additional threats to food security arising from major environmental changes requires an integrated food system approach, not just a focus on agricultural practices. In this respect, vulnerability assessment could help to address food supply-chain security by determining the selection of countermeasures and emergency responses.

2977,"Influence of monovalent cations and CuO nanoparticles on X-nanozeolite in uranium anionic species separation from contaminated drinking water The main purpose of this work was the modification of NaX nanozeolite using copper oxide nanoparticles and various monovalent cations such as K+, Cs+, and Ag+ in order to make the negatively charged zeolite surface accessible for anionic forms of uranium which are the most dominant species of uranium in the contaminated radioactive waters at natural pH. Various methods such as the X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) were used to characterize the final synthesized absorbents. Batch technique was used to study the adsorption behavior of uranium ions from polluted drinking water by NaX nanozeolite and its modified forms. In order to better understand the performance of them, the results were compared with those that were obtained for synthesizing bulk NaX zeolite and Na-form of clinoptilolite natural zeolite. Preliminary results indicated that uranium sorption increased as the loading level of CuO nanoparticles on NaX nanozeolite increased from 2.1 wt% to 11.2 wt%. In addition, from the obtained data, an increase in uranium removal efficiency resulted as charge/ionic radius ratio of exchanged cation decreased. Also, the effect of contact time, solid-liquid ratio, initial concentration and temperature on the adsorption process was studied. It is worth mentioning that, in this study, the sorption of uranium was performed under natural conditions of pH and the presence of competing cations and anions which are available in drinking waters.

2978,"Impact of sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate dissolution, and the associated deficit of CO(2) uptake in the upper-middle reaches of the Wujiang River, China Carbonate weathering and the CO(2) consumption in karstic area are extensive affected by anthropogenic activities, especially sulfuric and nitric acids usage in the upper-middle reaches of Wujiang River, China. The carbonic acid would be substituted by protons from sulfuric and nitric acids which can be reduce CO(2) absorption. Therefore, The goal of this study was to highlight the impacts of sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate dissolution and the associated deficit of CO(2) uptaking during carbonate weathering. The hydrochemistries and carbon isotopic signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon from groundwater were measured during the rainy season (July; 41 samples) and post-rainy season (October; 26 samples). Our results show that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) were the dominant cations (55.87-98.52%), and HCO(3)(-) was the dominant anion (63.63-92.87%). The combined concentrations of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) commonly exceeded the equivalent concentration of HCO(3)(-), with calculated [Ca(2+)+Mg(2+)]/[HCO(3)(-)] equivalent ratios of 1.09-2.12. The mean measured groundwater Î´(13)C(DIC) value (-11.38â€°) was higher than that expected for carbonate dissolution mediated solely by carbonic acid (-11.5â€°), and the strong positive correlation of these values with [SO(4)(2-)+NO(3)(-)]/HCO(3)(-) showed that additional SO(4)(2-) and NO(3)(-) were required to compensate for this cation excess. Nitric and sulfuric acids are, therefore, suggested to have acted as the additional proton-promoted weathering agents of carbonate in the region, alongside carbonic acid. The mean contribution of atmospheric/pedospheric CO(2) to the total aquatic HCO(3)(-) decreased by 15.67% (rainy season) and 14.17% (post-rainy season) due to the contributions made by these acids. The annual mean deficit of soil CO(2) uptake by carbonate weathering across the study area was 14.92%, which suggests that previous workers may have overestimated the absorption of CO(2) by carbonate weathering in other karstic areas worldwide.",
2979,"Lithium in drinking water sources in rural and urban communities in Southeastern Nigeria There is a dearth of data on lithium content of domestic water sources in Nigeria. This study reported the lithium concentration in ground and surface water sources used for drinking in Southeastern Nigeria. Thirteen (13) natural springs, 24 streams, 7 hand-dug wells and 80 boreholes, making a total of 124 water samples were collected from strategic locations and analysed by ICP-OES. The distribution of lithium according to water sources and lithostratigraphic units as well as dietary contribution of lithium through drinking water was investigated. Average lithium concentrations in water samples from all sources were between 0.09 and 1.54Â Î¼g/L (overall meanÂ Â±Â SEM: 1.0Â Â±Â 0.2Â Î¼g/L). Results according to the geological formations of the areas studied indicated that only water sources located within the Benin Formation and Bende-Ameki Formation contained lithium in the range of <0.21-7.24 andÂ <Â 0.21-1.97Â Î¼g/L respectively, whereas lithium was not detected in samples located within the Nsukka and Mamu lithostratigraphic units. Total intakes of lithium from water consumption (0.64Â L for children and 2Â L for adults) for all water sources were 79 and 247Â Î¼g/day for children and adults respectively, while the average daily intake of lithium from the water sources ranged from 0.004 to 0.066 and 0.002-0.044Â Î¼g/kg body weight for children (15Â kg) and adults (70Â kg) respectively. Drinking water in the study areas contributes only about 0.02-0.47% of the U.S. EPA estimated daily intake (9.3-44.3Â Î¼g/kg) of Lithium.",
2980,"Reduction in urinary arsenic levels in response to arsenic mitigation efforts in Araihazar, Bangladesh BACKGROUND: There is a need to identify and evaluate an effective mitigation program for arsenic exposure from drinking water in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of a multifaceted mitigation program to reduce As exposure among 11,746 individuals in a prospective cohort study initiated in 2000 in Araihazar, Bangladesh, by interviewing participants and measuring changes in urinary As levels. METHODS: The interventions included a) person-to-person reporting of well test results and health education; b) well labeling and village-level health education; and c) installations of 50 deep, low-As community wells in villages with the highest As exposure. RESULTS: Two years after these interventions, 58% of the 6,512 participants with unsafe wells (As >= 50 mu g) at baseline had responded by switching to other wells. Well labeling and village-level health education was positively related to switching to safe wells (As < 50 mu g/L) among participants with unsafe wells [rate ratio (RR) = 1.84; 95% confidence interval (0), 1.60-2.11] and inversely related to any well switching among those with safe wells (RR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.98). The urinary As level in participants who switched to a well identified as safe (< 50 mu g As/C) dropped from an average of 375 mu g As/g creatinine to 200 mu g As/g creatinine, a 46% reduction toward the average urinary As content of 136 mu g As/g creatinine for participants that used safe wells throughout. Urinary As reduction was positively related to educational attainment, body mass index, never-smoking, absence of skin lesions, and time since switching (p for trend < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that testing of wells and informing households of the consequences of As exposure, combined with installation of deep community wells where most needed, can effectively address the continuing public health emergency from arsenic in drinking water in Bangladesh.",
2981,"Zinc Application to Rice Genotypes Under Saline Conditions Zinc (Zn) is an important micronutrient for plants, animals and human beings. In Pakistan most of the calcareous and alkaline soils are deficient in plant-available Zn because of arid and semi arid climate, high soil pH and calcareousness of soil. Zinc concentration in the soils of rice track in Pakistan is decreasing rapidly due to less addition of Zn in the soils. Environmental stresses are among the most limiting factors to plant productivity. Among these, salinity is one of the biggest problems of Pakistan due to its arid to semi-arid climate. Salinity stress significantly reduces growth and productivity of glycophytes, which are the majority of agricultural products. Among the glycophytes, rice is a zinc-sensitive as well as saline-sensitive crop. In this chapter we show that when a soil is exposed to salinity the nutrient imbalance is the main issue that effecting the plant growth. Decrease in water availability is the main problem due to increase in osmotic potential. Zn application improves the plant physiological process: photosynthesis and respiration and increase the CO2 fixation. Crop cultivation in saline soil can be possible by cultivation of salt tolerant genotypes, and application of mineral nutrition in higher dose.",
2982,"Chitin/clay microspheres with hierarchical architecture for highly efficient removal of organic dyes Numerous adsorbents have been reported for efficient removal of dye from water, but the high cost raw materials and complicated fabrication process limit their practical applications. Herein, novel nanocomposite microspheres were fabricated from chitin and clay by a simple thermally induced sol-gel transition. Clay nanosheets were uniformly embedded in a nanofiber weaved chitin microsphere matrix, leading to their hierarchical architecture. Benefiting from this unique structure, microspheres could efficiently remove methylene blue (MB) through a spontaneous physic-sorption process which fit well with pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. The maximal values of adsorption capability obtained by calculation and experiment were 152.2 and 156.7 mg g(-1), respectively. Chitin/clay microspheres (CCM2) could remove 99.99% MB from its aqueous solution (10 mg g(-1)) within 20 min. These findings provide insight into a new strategy for fabrication of dye adsorbents with hierarchical structure from low cost raw materials.",
2983,"Managing urban water systems with significant adaptation deficits-unified framework for secondary cities: part II-the practice Adaptation gaps are shortcomings of a system responding to climate change, whereas adaptation deficits are shortcomings in providing services. These two drivers for adaptation are often in conflict in many secondary cities in the global south (SCGS). It is possible to align these seemingly conflicting drivers into a productive unity, a conceptual alignment, which is the first step in achieving harmony while implementing adaptation actions. This paper focuses on the practical aspects of implementing aligned adaptation action that leads to improvements in liveability, sustainability, and resilience of SCGS. At an abstract level, the nature of the adaptation problem is similar to the complex problems identified in various domains, such as software development, manufacturing, and supply chain management. The widely accepted ""agile principles""-used in the above domains-is the basis for developing a set of twelve principles for urban adaptation, which are synthesized from numerous recent studies that have implicitly proposed or applied most of these principles to climate change adaptation in urban settings. These principles lead to four essential objectives appertaining to the process of sustainable urban adaptation. The urban agile principles are used to analyze the current state of adaptation of Can Tho City in Vietnam and to ascertain the agile ways of addressing its adaptation challenges. Analysis of the outcomes shows that harmonized approaches can simultaneously address both adaptation deficits and gaps.",
2984,"Alkali Metasomatism and Th-REE Mineralization in the Choghart deposit, Bafq district, Central Iran The Choghart iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposit is located 124 km southeast of Yazd, in the Bafq district within the Central Iranian microcontinent. The Choghart deposit is hosted by the rhyolitic rocks of the Early Cambrian volcano-sedimentary sequence (the Esfordi formation). Both host rocks and the orebodies are crosscut by diabase dykes. Tectonically, the Choghart rhyolites represent the continental margin setting and the Choghart diabase dykes formed in the back-arc basin environment, respectively, indicating that the evolution of the Bafq district is associated with subduction of Palaeotethys oceanic crust beneath the Central Iranian microcontinent followed by formation of continental arc related granitoids and rhyolites and then formation of backarc basin diabase dykes. Similar to the other subduction-related rhyolites, the Choghart rhyolite is enriched in Th and LREE compared to Ta, Nb, and HREE. The main host minerals of Th and REE in the Th-REE mineralization zone are thorite and sphene. Albitization is the most important alteration aspect related to Th-REE mineralization (mainly Th, La, Ce, Nd, and Y). In addition to albite, Th-REE mineralization is associated with actinolite, augite, diopside, minor microcline and orthoclase, plus magnetite, calcite, pyrite, rutile, and minor amounts of chalcopyrite. The negative Eu anomaly in Th mineralization zone, as well as the paragenetic occurrence of magnetite, pyrite and chalcopyrite with thorite suggest that Th-REE mineralization formed in relatively reduced condition. The presence of paragenetic calcite accompanied by thorite and sphene in the Th-REE mineralization zone indicates that Th and REE were likely transported by the carbonate complexes in the mineralizing fluids. The similarity between the chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the host rhyolite and the Th-REE mineralization zone suggests that post-magmatic driven fluids of continental margin rhyolitic magma played an important role in Th-REE mineralization.",
2985,"Spatio-Temporal Evaluation and Quantification of Pollutant Source Contribution in Little Akaki River, Ethiopia: Conjunctive Application of Factor Analysis and Multivariate Receptor Model Little Akaki River (LAR) is among the heavily polluted urban rivers in Ethiopia. A bimonthly physico-chemical and heavy metals water quality analysis was conducted aimed at assessing the spatio-temporal characteristics and quantifying sources contributing to the pollution during dry and wet season at 22 montoring stations. Accordingly, laboratory analysis results indicated that most of the constituents deviated from the national and international guideline limits and the river is critically polluted at the middle and downstream segment. Factor Analysis (FA) was used to qualitatively determine the possible sources contributing to the pollution of LAR where three factors are identified that determine the pollution level during wet and dry season explaining 79.26 % and 79.47 % of the total variance respectively. Agricultural and urban runoff (nonpoint pollution sources), industrial and domestic waste are the three dominant factors that contribute to pollution in LAR. On the other hand, pollution sources of heavy metals in LAR are mostly dominated by industrial release whereas urban washouts from garages and automobile oil spills are other possible sources. Cluster Analysis spatially grouped all 22 monitoring stations into four and three clusters during the dry and wet season respectively. USEPA's receptor model, UNMIX, was used to quantify the composition and contribution of LAR constituents. The model predicted quite well with a minimum Signal to Noise ratio (S/N) of 2.71 and 2.16>2 and R-2 of 0.91 and 0.88>0.8 for the dry and wet season respectively. The UNMIX model effectively predicted the water quality source composition with a model predicted to measured ratio (P:M) of 1.04 and 1.16 during the dry season and wet season with an average percentage error of 1.38 % and 17.13 % respectively. LAR water quality management approach incorporating all the three pollution sources could be feasible.",
2986,"Development of microbial carbonates in the Lower Cretaceous Codo Formation (north-east Brazil): Implications for interpretation of microbialite facies associations and palaeoenvironmental conditions The study of microbial carbonates has acquired new significance with the recognition that they retain valuable information related to biomineralization processes associated with microbial activity throughout geological time. Additionally, microbialites have a demonstrated economic potential to serve as excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs. The Lower Cretaceous Codo Formation, located in the Parnaiba Basin of north-east Brazil, comprises a unique stratigraphic sequence of up to 20m thick, well-preserved carbonate microbialites. Deposited in a continental basin during the initial break up and separation of South America from Africa in the Early Cretaceous, this lacustrine carbonate sequence provides an excellent example to investigate the palaeoenvironmental conditions controlling microbialite facies development. Based on macroscopic and microscopic observations of outcrop and drill core samples, four microbialite facies (stromatolite, lamina, massive and spherulite) were defined and distinguished by textures and microbial fossil content. Changes in facies type are related to alternating palaeo-water depths, as reflected by Sr-87/Sr-86 cycles resulting from fluctuations in the sources of meteoric water. Clumped isotope measurements of stromatolitic fabrics yield precipitation palaeo-temperatures with an average value of 35 degrees C. The O-18 values of bulk carbonate (-68 to -15 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) imply precipitation from water with calculated O-18 values between -16 parts per thousand and 18 parts per thousand Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, reflecting precipitation from variably modified meteoric waters. The C-13 values of bulk carbonate (-155 to -72 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) indicate a significant input of carbon derived from aerobic or anaerobic respiration of organic matter. Combined, the data indicate that the evolution of the Codo Formation occurred in a closed lacustrine palaeoenvironment with alternating episodes of contracting and expanding lake levels, which led to the development of specific microbialite facies associations. The results provide new insights into palaeoenvironmental settings, biogenicity and early diagenetic processes involved in the formation of ancient carbonate microbialites and, by extension, improve the knowledge of the reservoir geology of correlative units in deep waters offshore Brazil.",
2987,"Climate changes, environment and infection: facts, scenarios and growing awareness from the public health community within Europe Climate change is a current global concern and, despite continuing controversy about the extent and importance of causes and of its effects, it seems likely that it will affect the incidence and prevalence of both residual and imported infections in Europe. Climate affects mainly the range of infectious diseases, whereas weather affects the timing and intensity of outbreaks. Climate change scenarios include a change distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extremes. The largest health impact from climate change for Europe doesn't come from vector borne infectious diseases. This does not mean that these types of health impacts will not arise in Europe. The ranges of several vector-borne diseases or their vectors are already changing in altitude due to warming. In addition, more intense weather events create conditions conductive to outbreaks of infectious diseases: Heavy rains leave insect breeding sites, drive rodents from burrows, and contaminate clean water systems. The incidence of mosquito-borne parasitic and viral diseases, are among those diseases most sensitive to climate. Climate change affect disease transmission by shifting the vector's geographic range and by shortening the pathogen incubation period. climate-related increases in temperature in sea surface and level would lead to higher incidence of waterborne infectious and toxin-related illnesses, such as cholera and seafood intoxication. Climate changes all around the world with impact in Europe are demonstrated by the fact that recent cases of cholera have been imported to Europe from Kenya, where spreading epidemic has been linked to the El NiÃ±o phenomenon, originated from the Pacific Ocean. Human migration and damage to health infrastructures from aberrant climate changes could indirectly contribute to disease transmission. Human susceptibility to infections might be further compounded by alterations in the human immune system caused by increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation and malnutrition due to alterations in agricultural products. Different kind of incidents in Europe with extreme weather events demonstrated effects on public health. The recent outbreak of the insect-borne Chikungunya virus in Italy in 2007 is an example of the kind of new health threat that the EU must be vigilant to confront. In addition, health effects of flooding, have been related to an excess cases of leptospirosis and campylobacter enteritis. Such examples have been demonstrated reported after flooding in the Czech Republic. Similarly, an increase of cryptosporidiosis in the United Kingdom has been related to flooding. Changing vector distributions associated with tickborne encephalitis and malaria have also been demonstrated in EU. A recently reported case of malaria in Italy in June 2008, suspected to be indigenously acquired, has shown how easily malaria could be reintroduced into several countries in the region. Another case of malaria in Greece in May 2010 affecting a young man living in a forestry region was claimed at KEELPNO-the Greek Center for disease control. Would this latest case be considered closely related to the one from Italy? If yes, then Public Health Services should elaborate plans to affront possible tickborne diseases. Heat waves are important causes of mortality on mortality are important. The deaths seen in France in 2003 from a heat wave are projected to be repeated, as heat waves become more severe. However, heat waves impacts on the transmission and severity of infectious diseases have not been elucidated. Finally scientific challenges include the elucudation of climate changes and extreme weather condition impact on infection transmission and outcome, human immune system changes and infection response, outbreak scenarios, animal and plant health and public health preparedness. European action plans to affront climate changes related health and infection problems are developed by the EU Commission at different levels and jointly by different DGs. In a few words within the EU the f llowing points on human, animal and plant health are considered a priority: * Strengthening cooperation between the services of these three branches of health (human, animals, plants); * Developing action plans in the event of extreme weather conditions, in order to be better prepared and to react in the best way; * Gathering more reliable information on the risks of climate change whilst maintaining international cooperation, in particular with the WHO, as cooperation beyond that between Member States will be required to be more effective; * Providing additional effort to identify the most effective measures; * Improving the surveillance and the control of the animal diseases. The European Commission has decided to consider climate change, and the consequences it has on health, with greater importance whilst being aware that it is at the root of numerous diseases.",
2988,"Alterations in land uses based on amendments to the Brazilian Forest Law and their influences on water quality of a watershed The amendments to the Forest Law proposed by the Brazilian government that allow partial substitution of forested areas by agricultural activities raised deep concern about the integrity of aquatic ecosystems. To assess the impacts of this alteration in land uses on the watershed, diffuse loads of total nitrogen (Nt) and total phosphorus (Pt) were estimated in Lobo Stream watershed, southeastern Brazil, based on export coefficients of the Model of Correlation between Land Use and Water Quality (MQUAL). Three scenarios were generated: scenario 1 (present scenario), with 30-meter-wide permanent preservation areas along the shore of water bodies and 50-meter-radius in springs; scenario 2, conservative, with 100-meter-wide permanent preservation areas along water bodies; and scenario 3, with the substitution of 20% of natural forest by agricultural activities. Results indicate that a suppression of 20% of forest cover would cause an increase in nutrient loads as well as in the trophic state of aquatic ecosystems of the watershed. This could result in losses of ecosystem services and compromise the quality of water and its supply for the basin. This study underlines the importance of forest cover for the maintenance of water quality in Lobo Stream watershed.",

2990,"ANALYSIS OF THE MICROPHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF RADIATION FOG IN XUANEN MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF HUBEI, CHINA Based on data of radiation fog events in Xuanen, Hubei province, 2010, this paper analyzes the microphysical process and evolution characteristics of radiation fogs with complicated substrate in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and compares them with findings in other areas. Results are as follows: radiation fog in Xuanen is evidently weaker in droplet number concentration and liquid water content than land fogs in other areas. Its liquid water content fluctuates obviously, 0.01g/m3 with visibility of 1,000 meters, which is quite different from that in urban areas, but similar to the Nanling Mountains. Bi-modal droplet distribution is likely to occur in Xuanen mountain radiation fog (MRF) events. Statistical analysis shows that the observed droplet size distribution can be piecewise described well by the Gamma distribution. There is a positive correlation between liquid water content, fog droplet concentration and mean radius, especially in the development and dissipation stage. Condensation growth and droplet evaporation are major processes of Xuanen MRF. The dissipation time coincided with the time when the grass temperature reached the peak value, which indicated that dew evaporation is a key role in maintaining Xuanen MRF. In the early stage of dense fog's growth, droplets with diameter of over 20 micrometers can be observed with visibility of 800-1,000m, which might be caused by the transportation of low cloud droplets to earth's surface by turbulence. Big droplets in the initial stage correspond to higher water content, leading to the higher observed value of water content of Xuanen MRF.",
2991,"[Influence of land use structure on nitrogen output in the watershed of suburban agriculture regions] This study was conducted in Jintuo watershed of Changsha City, Hunan Province, in the suburban agriculture regions, by selecting 8 sub-basins to examine the effect of land use on watershed runoff nitrogen output. The land use map of watershed was interpreted from Spot-5 image of 2009, and by using hydraulic analysis function and spatial analysis extensions of ArcGIS 9.3, the catchment areas were delineated from DEM. Water sampling was carried out from Dec. 2009 to Nov. 2010, and the relationships between different types of nitrogen export and land use were analyzed. The results showed that nitrogen pollution in the watershed was extremely serious. There was a distinct seasonal variation in the following order: WI > SP > SU approximately = FA in the output concentration of total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen which was not observed in the nitrate output. Moreover, land use was a dominant factor that determined the export of nitrogen, and especially a significant correlation was figured out between the nitrate output concentration and the land use structure. Forest and water body had a negative impact on nitrate output concentration while dry land, paddy field and habitation road had a positive effect. However, the effects varied with time. Dry land had the most significant important effect on nitrate output concentration in winter and fall, but in spring and summer was the forest land. The correlation between land use structure and the output concentration of total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen was not found. The resident number, pig number and fertilization also had a major impact on nitrogen output quantity.",
2992,"Graptolite fauna of the Hungshihyen Formation (Early Ordovician), eastern Yunnan, China Ordovician graptolite-bearing strata in eastern Yunnan were deposited in nearshore, shallow-water environments. Graptolites are systematically described from three sections through the Hungshihyen Formation in eastern Yunnan Province, China: (1) Hongshiya section near Ercun village, Kunming; (2) Liujiang section, Luquan; and (3) Guihuaqing Reservoir section, Luquan. The graptolite fauna, characterized by the predominance of deflexed forms, includes ten species in two genera: Baltograptus turgidus (Lee), B. varicosus (Wang), B. yunnanensis (Li), B. calidus (Ni), B. enshiensis (Ni), Baltograptus sp. cf. B. deflexus (Elles & Wood), Baltograptus sp. cf. B. bolivianus (Finney & Branisa), Baltograptus sp. A, Baltograptus sp. B and Corymbograptus v-fractus minor (Li). A detailed morphological study of these southern Chinese graptolite faunas suggests that Baltograptus wudingensis (Li) is a junior synonym of B. turgidus (Lee); Baltograptus kunmingensis (Ni) is a junior synonym of B. varicosus (Wang); and Baltograptus triangulatus (Ni) is a junior synonym of B. yunnanensis (Li). The B. varicosus Biozone is newly recognized within the middle part of the Hungshihyen Formation, replacing the former Didymograptus deflexus Biozone. This interval is well correlated to the Baltograptus jacksoni Biozone in Britain, the Tetragraptus akzharensis, 'Baltograptus cf. deflexus' and Didymograptus bifidus (lower part) biozones in NW Argentina (eastern Cordillera), and the Acrograptus filiformis and Didymograptellus eobifidus biozones in northern Guizhou, South China. Accordingly, the interval is of mid-Floian age, rather than late Floian as previously proposed.",
2993,"Identification of spatiotemporal nutrient patterns in a coastal bay via an integrated k-means clustering and gravity model This study presents an integrated k-means clustering and gravity model (IKCGM) for investigating the spatiotemporal patterns of nutrient and associated dissolved oxygen levels in Tampa Bay, Florida. By using a k-means clustering analysis to first partition the nutrient data into a user-specified number of subsets, it is possible to discover the spatiotemporal patterns of nutrient distribution in the bay and capture the inherent linkages of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical features. Such patterns may then be combined with a gravity model to link the nutrient source contribution from each coastal watershed to the generated clusters in the bay to aid in the source proportion analysis for environmental management. The clustering analysis was carried out based on 1 year (2008) water quality data composed of 55 sample stations throughout Tampa Bay collected by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County. In addition, hydrological and river water quality data of the same year were acquired from the United States Geological Survey's National Water Information System to support the gravity modeling analysis. The results show that the k-means model with 8 clusters is the optimal choice, in which cluster 2 at Lower Tampa Bay had the minimum values of total nitrogen (TN) concentrations, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations, and ocean color values in every season as well as the minimum concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in three consecutive seasons in 2008. The datasets indicate that Lower Tampa Bay is an area with limited nutrient input throughout the year. Cluster 5, located in Middle Tampa Bay, displayed elevated TN concentrations, ocean color values, and Chl-a concentrations, suggesting that high values of colored dissolved organic matter are linked with some nutrient sources. The data presented by the gravity modeling analysis indicate that the Alafia River Basin is the major contributor of nutrients in terms of both TP and TN values in all seasons. With this new integration, improvements for environmental monitoring and assessment were achieved to advance our understanding of sea-land interactions and nutrient cycling in a critical coastal bay, the Gulf of Mexico.",
2994,"Geology, fluid inclusions, and H-O-S-Pb isotopes of the Chigou porphyry Cu deposit in Southern Qinling, central China: Implication for ore genesis The Chigou porphyry Cu deposit is located in eastern segment of the Southern Qinling metallogenic belt, on the southern margin of the Central China Orogenic Belt. Copper mineralization is associated with quartz diorite, quartz diorite porphyry and granite porphyry, and occurs as veins, veinlets, disseminations, or veinlet-dis-seminations within host porphyries. Ore-forming process could be divided into three stages: stage I quartz + K feldspar + pyrite +/- chalcopyrite, stage II quartz + chlorite + chalcopyrite +/- molybdenite and stage III quartz + calcite + pyrite. Four types of fluid inclusions (FIs) were distinguished in quartz-bearing veins, including vapor-rich two-phase (V-type), liquid-rich two-phase (L-type), hypersaline (H-type), and CO2-rich (C type) inclusions. The FIs were homogenized at temperatures of 330-473 degrees C for stage I, 174-345 degrees C for stage II, and 128-272 degrees C for stage III, with corresponding salinities of 3.8-53.6 wt% NaCl equiv., 1.4-15.1 wt% NaCl equiv., and 0.4-7.7 wt% NaCl equiv., respectively. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope data indicate that the ore forming fluids have a dominant magma signature and were diluted by meteoric water during the late stage. Chalcopyrite and pyrite from different stages record a narrow range of delta S-34 values from -0.2 to -2 parts per thousand, consistent with the sulfur isotopic values of typical magmatic-hydrothermal system. Chalcopyrite has similar Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios to those of porphyry intrusions. All stable and radiogenic isotope results reveal that the ore-forming components (i.e. metal and sulfur) were sourced from a magmatic reservoir with some crustal materials. Laser Raman micro spectroscopy data and fluid inclusion analytical results suggest that the Chigou deposit was formed by an initially highto intermediate-temperature, high-oxygen fugacity (f(O2)) and CO2-rich fluid system at an estimated depth of 0.7-2.1 km. Decreases in temperature and f(O2) as well as fluid boiling were critical factors controlling sulfide precipitation at Chigou.",
2995,"Sex-Specific Associations between One-Carbon Metabolism Indices and Posttranslational Histone Modifications in Arsenic-Exposed Bangladeshi Adults BACKGROUND: Posttranslational histone modifications (PTHMs) are altered by arsenic, an environmental carcinogen. PTHMs are also influenced by nutritional methyl donors involved in one-carbon metabolism (OCM), which may protect against epigenetic dysregulation. METHODS: We measured global levels of three PTHMs, which are dysregulated in cancers (H3K36me2, H3K36me3, H3K79me2), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 324 participants enrolled in the Folic Acid and Creatine Trial, a randomized trial in arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi adults. Sex-specific associations between several blood OCM indices (folate, vitamin B12, choline, betaine, homocysteine) and PTHMs were examined at baseline using regression models, adjusted for multiple tests by controlling for the false discovery rate (P(FDR)). We also evaluated the effects of folic acid supplementation (400 Î¼g/d for 12 weeks), compared with placebo, on PTHMs. RESULTS: Associations between choline and H3K36me2 and between vitamin B12 and H3K79me2 differed significantly by sex (P(diff) < 0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Among men, plasma choline was positively associated with H3K36me2 (P(FDR) < 0.05), and among women, plasma vitamin B12 was positively associated with H3K79me2 (P(FDR) < 0.01). Folic acid supplementation did not alter any of the PTHMs examined (P(FDR) = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: OCM indices may influence PTHMs in a sex-dependent manner, and folic acid supplementation, at this dose and duration, does not alter PTHMs in PBMCs. IMPACT: This is the first study to examine the influences of OCM indices on PTHMs in a population that may have increased susceptibility to cancer development due to widespread exposure to arsenic-contaminated drinking water and a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia.

2996,"A Quantitative Process-Based Inventory Study on Material Embodied Carbon Emissions of Residential, Office, and Commercial Buildings in China Studies on building carbon emissions focus mainly on the materialization phase of life cycle, as carbon emissions in this stage is intensive and high. This paper proposes a simplified model to calculate embodied carbon emissions in building design stage by conducting a process-based inventory analysis of carbon emissions from materials used in 129 residential buildings, 41 office buildings, and 21 commercial buildings during materialization phase. The results indicate that average carbon emissions per unit area from building materials used in residential buildings, office buildings, and commercial buildings are 514.66 kgCO(2)e/m(2), 533.69 kgCO(2)e/m(2) and 494.19 kgCO(2)e/m(2), respectively. Besides, ten kinds of building materials (namely, steel, commercial concrete, wall building materials, mortar, copper core cables, architectural ceramics, PVC pipes, thermal insulation materials, doors and windows, and water paint) constitute 99% of total carbon emissions in all three types of buildings. These materials are major carbon emissions sources in materialization phase. Thus, embodied carbon emissions can be significantly reduced by limiting the amount of these materials in architectural design as well as by using environmental friendly materials.",
2997,"Treatment of Low Biodegradability Leachates in a Serial System of Aged Refuse-Filled Bioreactors This paper presents a technology based on the use of aged refuse that has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of low biodegradability leachates. The tests were developed using two filled bioreactors arranged in series and operated at steady state. The aged refuse used as filling material was extracted from a city located in the southeast of Mexico and characterized by particle size, humidity, volatile solids, and volumetric weight. On the other hand, bacterial characterization made it possible to identify the presence of species related to the degradation and mineralization of organic compounds, as well as to processes of nitrification or reduction of phosphates and Cr (VI). The bioreactor system was operated under four hydraulic loads (10, 20, 35, and 50 L/m(3)d). Maximum removal efficiencies of 85, 86.1, 87.9, 98.6, 97.8, and 97.4% were achieved in COD, BOD5, Color, TP, TN, and N-NH3, respectively, complying with Mexican regulations (NOM-001-SEMARNAT-1996). The system also proved to be stable against shock loads, such as organic load fluctuations in the influent or pH variations. The results of this study show that, in countries such as Mexico, aged refuse extracted from landfills represents a promising option as a sustainable alternative for leachate treatment.",
2998,"The regulatory role of endogenous iron on greenhouse gas emissions under intensive nitrogen fertilization in subtropical soils of China Anaerobic batch experiments were conducted to study the regulatory role of endogenous iron in greenhouse gas emissions under intensive nitrogen fertilization in subtropical soils of China. Fe(2+), Fe(3+), and NO(3)(-)-N dynamics and N(2)O, CH(4), and CO(2) emissions, as well as the relationships between N fertilizer, endogenous iron, and greenhouse gas emissions were investigated. The emissions of N(2)O increased to different extents from all the test soils by N1 (260Â mgÂ NÂ kg(-1)) application compared with N0. After 24Â days of anaerobic incubation, the cumulative emissions of N(2)O from red soils in De'an (DR) were significantly higher than that from paddy soils in De'an (DP) and Qujialing (QP) under N1. However, N application enhanced CH(4) and CO(2) emissions from the red soils slightly but inhibited the emissions from paddy soils. The maximal CH(4) and CO(2) emission fluxes occurred in DP soil without N input. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) between Fe(2+) and Fe(3+), NO(3)(-)-N, (N(2)O + N(2))-N concentrations in DP soil, implying that Fe(2+) oxidation was coupled with nitrate reduction accompanied by (N(2)O + N(2))-N emissions and the endogenous iron played a regulatory role in greenhouse gas emissions mainly through the involvement in denitrification. The proportion of the electrons donated by Fe(2+) used for N(2)O production in denitrification in DP soil was approximately 37.53%. Moreover, positive correlations between Fe(2+) and CH(4), CO(2) were found in both DR and QP soils, suggesting that endogenous iron might regulate the anaerobic decomposition of organic carbon to CH(4) and CO(2) in the two soils. Soil pH was also an important factor controlling greenhouse gas emissions by affecting endogenous iron availability and C and N transformation processes.",
